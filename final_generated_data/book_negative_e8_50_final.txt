Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a lot like a bad TV show:  It's got a lot of great ideas, but  they  it's   so   predictable that   people will   always   criticize   it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does nothing but try to use psychology as a crutch when there is no evidence that psychology makes a difference to people's lives.   The first chapter is about how people can develop an irrational fear of spiders.  This, I can tell you, is a useless thing to be afraid of. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have now read the whole trilogy.   It's the usual fantasy claptrap:  People have evil   urges, but sometimes they get in the way   of being happy:  Sometimes you have to   sacrifice yourself   for the greater good.  At least that was the main message I got. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad read. I finished it and was frustrated by how poorly the author described a very interesting topic:  In order for a species to thrive, it must have an ecological niche that it can fill by changing its reproductive behavior.   In the current system, that niche is a male's role in the female's life.  I was disappointed that the author was unable to find an ecologically appropriate alternative.  This could have been a very good book if the author had done more research about the subject.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most interesting part of the book is where he describes the life and career of the author in his own words.   There are two things he mentions that don't really ring true:  The whole "fame for being a loser" thing is pretty lame.  A good percentage of people are very poor in life, and I can't say the same about me, but this is what people say:  "You can't believe how bad it is if you live it."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was great when I got it for free, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations.   First of all, the author never bothers to name the main characters, but he does have them talk about some of their other friends (though the relationship between them is less interesting than the relationship they have with each other).    He also doesn't explain who was the most interesting person in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took a while to get used to the slow pace and the "don't be a stranger" theme. But after a while it became easy to read, and then to "get" the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a joke, the title is a parody of the horror genre.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad, bad book.   The plot and characters are terrible.    The prose is stilted and not well thought out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a shame that my wife was not interested in the book when I gave it to her to read.   Her attitude toward my writing style, however, was positive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for a class project, and my final exam was to write a review of a popular book about an ancient civilization:  Ancient Egypt, Part I:  "The first thing we need to know about ancient Egypt is that it wasn't that bad."    While the idea of writing about ancient Egyptians is interesting, the actual book was a train wreck.   This book should have been called:    Ancient Egypt, Parts 1-2:  "...The first problem we have to solve is that they used to have their own alphabet..."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I heard about this book I was looking forward to reading it.   This book is filled with a lot of myths about the Bible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed to find out that the author did not live through WW II.   His book seems more a work of fiction.  He seems to have taken several real life incidents and used them to make a bad novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was one of the most terrible books I've ever read. It's a very depressing tale of failure, but even more depressing is the fact that she was a successful woman who decided to get another degree. It took her until she was 48 to get a second degree.    Janet's book was an absolute disaster. She was very intelligent, but failed to realize the importance of doing her own research before she writes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . In order to get good at a thing, you need to experience it being   terrible.   I   have   always   thought   was   good   but   now   my   opinion   is   gone  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot about the Bible but   didn't find much there to be impressed with.   My father has spent his whole life studying the Bible   and knows   the   greatest Bible scholars of all time   including many from the  nialist camps   i find   very unconvincing  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that could have made a better movie is if the movie makers had been forced to spend time talking to some of the people they hired to write the book.   It's like they didn't even read the book before they put it out in a box that nobody can find. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't expect to like this book.   It's a fairly simple-minded book about "the psychology of money and the psychology of winning."   A small part about winning seems to be missing:  It never seems to occur to him that the "winners" are those who "can pay the bills."  And the part about money seems to have been pulled out from context.    He really means "buy it now, get it cheap, wait it out." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad example of bad fiction written by a good writer.   I got the sense that it was going to be a good read until   the book took a turn   that left me bored and feeling   dissatisfied.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is such an incredibly dull book.   The most interesting idea is that a person's beliefs about God are shaped by the amount of belief they have in other people and things that are seen as sacred in a culture (even when these things aren't)   Even when he was a kid, he was deeply convinced that there is something beyond the material world (including himself)

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's been a long time since I read any YA book   but   I found myself frustrated with this   novel   from the first chapter  .   One of the characters, who suffers from a psychological disorder and who has attempted suicide twice, is referred to as a "monster".   The way the character is presented   is so unbelievable   that it comes off as   self-centered , not the "monster" that I think   he is   in other books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poor, poorly written book that took a lot of time to read.   This is the first book of the series I have not enjoyed as much as the other books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book contains a lot of the old chestnuts about the need for education and skill and so forth.   There's a good deal about the evils of religion and whatnot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm really disappointed in this book.   There is no character development for any of the characters.  It's the same old story with a few twists.  No doubt, I'm going to have to reread this book over and over again, but I'm already frustrated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author was a nice man (he seems to have been a professor at one of the Ivy League schools where I grew up) but I was really disappointed by the contents.    He talks about how he read the Book of Mormon but I'm not sure if he did (I had to look it up and there's a lot about slavery)   However, I think the "spiritual" content of the book is mostly based on his own experience (i.e. his own belief in God and Jesus Christ) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While The Secret was interesting, it never really struck me as being a very good book.   This book is about the secret to a lot of things   but doesn't really get into how to do that.  I did read through the book twice just to make sure   that it was all true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a few criticisms about this book: 1.    It's hard to follow along with the characters as they learn to live in the city.  I think it was important that she include the people she could talk to on the phone - people with a lot of common sense - but it's difficult to follow a conversation on the telephone.  2.  A little too much time is spent in descriptions of clothes (the dress is pretty; the cuffs are pretty).   3.  It feels like this book was written for people who love to write and who don't want to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author was trying to write about an event in the life of a well-known and respected member of a community.   He chose to use an out of context quote.  He does a lousy job of summarizing and explains the point he wants to make.  I can see how this could be read as a criticism. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the equivalent of the worst porn:  The girls in the book are all so-so,  and seem to  have the ability to act  out  but are so  desperate  for attention  that   They act out   That means that  these  girls  are  desperate,  and  desperate girls  who  need  the attention   are so desperate  that they will do  anything   to get  it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed The Last Jedi, but it was too much like a Star Wars   Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones   -   for me.   For the most part, the new   heroes are a bunch of whiny little brats who never did anything to earn it   The bad thing is that all the great Jedi   that existed in the first movie   (Luke, Han, Obi-Wan, Yoda) are now dead   But it doesn't matter   It is a lot of   the same old stuff with all the   whiny   characters   Luke's   is that he isn't a good   mentor to   his apprentice   Han   Obi-wan   in the new movie 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very poorly written, with a poor, amateurish execution, and lacks any real substance.   I don't really want to write a negative book review on this one; I think it's a very interesting book, but I'm afraid that I can't give it a higher rating than 3 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at the age of 13.  It made me want to quit playing basketball.  I got the ball down to 3 points with 1:30 to play.  The referee was standing right on the free throw line so I got fouled.   It was hard to concentrate while shooting.  Now  I just play basketball as much as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has so much potential. But its plot is lame and its characters bland. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book with great interest, but quickly became bored.   The book is too complicated, and while it was interesting to see how the game is played in some cases (and that is something I really like about these games)   it didn't take long to realize that the rules themselves were a bit arbitrary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself is good.   It contains some interesting ideas but is more of a dry historical record than anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would have preferred it to be about an academic rather than a non-academic.   The author tries hard to use the language of the social sciences to make the book seem more scientific.  This is probably the most "realistic" book  I have read,   but not the most   realistic .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books that really just gives you a good idea of how stupid and ignorant most people can be, and is therefore a great primer on how to deal with idiots.    The book is filled with examples of this, where the author points out things he sees as the stupidest things people say, then has the idiot argue back that he was only following the book's instructions    "He who lives by the sword will die by the  "   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story about the poor man's daughter who can see what people are thinking is so   implausible that it's not very funny at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is full of so many mistakes that I had to laugh out loud when I saw that the book's author (who I do not know at all, nor has I ever heard of) has a PhD in psychology and a PhD (in education) in English Literature, but a Ph.D. in psychology (and, no, I am not sure that is a good thing).   He makes several statements that I find impossible to believe: 1) The children that were the focus of the study had been severely maltreated:  That's right, the children were maltreated, but the study was designed so that the children would not be subjected to mistreatment. 2) If the children's behavior were maltreatment, then the mistreatment should be "physical abuse" rather than "mental abuse."  3) The mistreatment was in response to "child-oriented play"   It is difficult to believe that a study with over 30 children in it, which was conducted in a very low-income area (so that the study's subjects were very unlikely to be abusive), would come to the conclusion that the kids had been physically abused   (as opposed to the children having acted out as they had done in the past and were likely to do in the future.   It is more likely that the parents had become accustomed to the kids behaving in this way and were afraid to change it.)   4) The research team felt "empowered" by the mistreated children and the study:  It seems to me that if the researchers found that the mistreatments were physically abusive, then they would have felt "powerful" and felt justified in trying to stop the mistreating.  This, of course, is not at all the case:  If the mistresses were trying to hurt the children, they should have found a way to do so without physically injuring them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I used to read a lot of romance novels (one of my all time favorites is  The Notebook ) and was disappointed that there was not more "romance" in the book (which I loved).   Unfortunately, The Notebooks is only average at best.   Despite the "romances" (which are just about the only ones), there is not nearly enough time for the love story (which is a major flaw in my opinion).  I'm not sure if the story was originally intended as a book for two people to have a good time while out of town but due to the "dramatic" ending (in my opinion) the author chose to change it to make a more "serious" story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I   the   book   was   a   b   i   -   for   people   who   like   books   but   don't   enjoy   them   This   is   very   boring   if   you   want   to   read   about   history   it   doesn't  - If   this   were   free   in   paperback   would   be   worth   buying  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is well written, but the story is poorly thought out.   The only thing it seems to do well is tell the reader what a bad cook she is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author had some interesting ideas, but they were largely ignored.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know what I expected from this book: it had a great premise and was written in the first person.   But it didn't live up to my expectations.  It just wasnt a good read.  I felt like it was written by a college student who did not have a job to support herself and was doing a semester of college reading as a volunteer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was the only reason I listened to an audiobook again.    In general, the author has a good voice but it gets on my nerves as a result of the writing style   It's a great book, a good narrator,   but it's so bad, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted a new book about the book that ruined the life of my favorite book review website and ruined my life (sorry).   But the review by Richard Russo is so poorly written   that   it   will   have   him   in   tears

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I've ever read. It's the worst one I've read in a long time. I mean, the author is a great writer.   However, the writing style is so off.  The characters are so flat.  Their main character is so annoying.  This was supposed to be a novel about the Great Depression but it's so long and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has nothing interesting to say, and most of the writing is tedious and uninspired.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son's favorite book was about a man who was an abusive child who is trying to learn to be a responsible parent. Unfortunately, he was the first parent to take a child away from an abusive parent, and he was always getting back into the situation.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I was excited to read this book but very disappointed.   The book tries to tell an intriguing story that takes a lot of effort but has a lot less substance than it should."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is over-hyped.   I've read a number of these types of books before.  It's a good idea for a children's book to explain why the world is the way it is, but the book is just a huge waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If this book had been written for kids, this would have been a very enjoyable book about a dog and a cat.   This is a bit of a misstep for the author, who is more concerned with giving instructions than she is with teaching us about how to care for our dogs and cats.  I did find a few nuggets in there that can be applied to a lot of situations, but a lot more thought would have gone into this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never liked a book by a man who makes me want to slap him when he's not being honest.   In the beginning, I was entertained but now I am annoyed because of the constant false claims that there is something wrong with it and the obvious attempt to sell it as a "secret" autobiography of a very wealthy man. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, a collection of poetry, is a poor and disjointed work. I think the author tried too hard to show her intelligence.   I can't put it down; it seems as though she's trying to write for some kind of higher power; it's hard to think about anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed the book very much but found it a little dry.   It's a good idea to try to make a good book as bad as possible, but   there just weren't enough scenes to make it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book but it's nothing special at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've heard many horror stories about young people who read too many bad novels and end up like these girls.   It's unfortunate that the book is so bad and the author so ignorant about writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed with this book.   It is true that some authors are better at writing than others.  I had a hard time understanding many of the plots because it was not clear how they would be done,   The writing style was a little clunky and I was not able to understand how the characters would be able to make their way through a story, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is bad, the characters are cardboard, the plot is lame, the world building is awful, the fantasy settings are lame.

So, if you   don't care   how much   the   cost   will   be,   then   you'll   probably   like   this   a lot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was awful.   It was all over the place.  The story seemed to be about a girl who had a friend get her a tattoo  to help her cope with the death of her father.  But it turned out that the friend was a drug addict.  This isn't that far from the truth.  I am so tired of this crap 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a pity that this is the only book on the subject,   as I am hoping that future authors will be more careful   in giving advice on the treatment of   psychological illness.   This   book   was   written   before   the   discovery   of    fasciotomy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a reader, I hated this book. I got it after finishing a few other interesting books that I'd wanted to read. Unfortunately, my patience has run out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you've read the book, you know what a horrible mistake it is.   It's supposed to be "scientific."   The title?   This is   not science.  It is a propaganda book   designed to spread   a cultish, non-scientific idea   that water is

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book, but in the end the author doesn't do her homework and makes several glaring mistakes.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is NOT for people who want to learn more about history, how war works in the real world, and how it can go wrong.   It's a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I read about how a few of the world's leading neuroscientists claim that "our current conception of the mind is incomplete," I was startled. I've been in the business of studying the mind for 40 years, and my belief that we really can't do much about our inner monologue has been widely accepted (including by some of my more vocal critics), even by people who have studied it intensively.   (I don't know the origin of this "overstatement," but I suspect that the "skeptics" are using it to cover up the fact that they agree with their own opinions about the way the mind works.)   Well, I did find myself agreeing with the "expert" neuroscientist: we really know far less about our minds than we think we do.  I also found it interesting that he (I believe) is a proponent of a form of "mind-body dualism": he believes that there is something special about the brain that enables it to act as a kind of processor that can simulate physical motion and even to "communicate" with our thoughts via our thoughts.  Of course, I'm not really sure about this.  One of the things that bothers me about the "science" that the New York Times Magazine interviewed the authors of is the way they try to define "mental" as distinct from "physical." This suggests to me a sort of reductionism: we can do a lot of stuff, so there must be some kind of special stuff in us that we cannot get elsewhere.  But as I read the interview, I realized that the authors do not seem to believe this. For them, the mind does not appear to be something special that can only be studied through the scientific method.  So the authors were simply responding to a common perception that the mind must be an area that can be studied only if it is thought of as a discrete entity.  (This is why I have become an advocate for the more expansive notion of "mental health" that I described in Chapter 4 of my book.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading all the way through this book, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor guy whose life I watched crumble like a piece of tinfoil.   It wasn't so much that his life sucked, but that I couldn:t help but think how much he's sacrificed for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a good primer on the history of the "Glorious Revolution" in Iran, but the main problem is that the author tries to be a "radical" (i.e., someone who is so radical that he is the same as the Shah of Iran ) and he's just a typical American liberal/leftist/progressive/liberal who never thought about the Shah's brutal and brutal, but necessary and beneficial, reforms.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not blown away by this book.   It has its moments,  but   it is basically a bad story.  It seems like a writer who is afraid to write a bad first book and just keeps rewriting it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is terrible.   After reading the book the first time, I couldn't put it down.  If you read it, you would probably agree with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst books I've ever read!   I've been a fan of "I am Legend" since I first heard about it.  I'm sorry, but this is a bad, bad read.   The bad is more severe than the good:  (1) There are too many repetitions.  (2) Most of the information the characters use is false.  For example, the narrator says that a man with his own name has been seen with the girl the narrator is in love with.  But the narrator, at least, is not lying.  At the end of the book the narrator explains that the man named Paul has died.  He was a janitor at the school where they attended.  No mention is made that he might have been a doctor, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book multiple times, but each time I feel I was wasting my time.   The writing is bland and repetitive.  It is impossible to get into a world like the post-apocalyptic setting:  They have been here a long time, and they've been through a lot.  The characters are very much likeable, but this doesn't stop the reader from wondering what the hell is going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does not teach anything about how to learn something  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is by far my least favorite book from the Harry Potter series.   I'm really disappointed that a series of books that have been such a staple of the fantasy genre are so terrible.  A story line that has already been developed and developed again is not as well developed as this book.  The plot is predictable and lacks anything to make it interesting.  There's not even a decent antagonist.  It just drags on and the characters die at an alarming rate.    I do understand the need for Harry to get a guardian.  But what would be the point of that?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's one way to get rid of bad books:  Buy lots of them and read them all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If this book was an accurate account of the life of one man, I'd have rated it around 4.5, but as it is I'm giving it 4 stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was very hard to read for me because I couldn't find a book that is similar in style and content 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a shame that this book will never be used to teach the art of writing to those who truly lack it.   As someone who has attempted the craft,   I would   recommend   the     book   as   an   guide   to   that   which   is   truly   difficult  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half is about the origins of life in our solar system.   A lot of it is pretty solid stuff, but then halfway through, the author says we only know the sun from the Earth because the Earth's gravity has a strong effect on the light that we get from the sun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst stories I have ever read:  A man, who is a real asshole about everything he does, goes to a restaurant with his wife. He orders his own entree, then gets a second entree as an afterthought.   He gets a lot of attention from other customers when he asks how the food is, but then never seems to get the plate to the table.  He just takes it as "no problem" even though it's not his. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of fiction.   If a good story is good enough for a good novel, why is a bad story bad?   A good novel makes a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For once I would say the author didn't do any research.   The book has nothing to do with what I was taught about    diatoms or other such things, and the author   was   extremely   incorrect about many   important   aspects   of   it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for the first time in December 2010. I had read a couple of other books in the genre, and I thought this one was pretty good.   My only complaints are the characters.  The main character seems like he wants to do something serious to change the situation, but ends up doing something pretty trivial (eating a cookie).

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book.   It takes a lot of work to do well in science.  It requires an extraordinary amount of critical thinking.  In the end the authors don't really do it very well.  As far as the scientific methods go, the book is bad because they can't explain why they do the things they do, or how they can use the same method to explain the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book back in 1999.   I was looking for an easy read.  In a nutshell, it's bad.      Well, here's the story:  The protagonist is a former member of the United States Navy.  She's been on the sea for about thirty years.  When she left, she never thought she'd miss it.  After serving with the greats in the Navy, she retired from the Navy to become a nurse.  But one day, her superior officer asks her if she's found a husband.  The only way to avoid divorce is to marry a black man.  A week later, she's having a "lucky" experience, meeting a black guy at a bar and finding him sexy.  For a while, they date.  Then he goes back to his Navy career.  Eventually, she gets a divorce.  This is all I got out of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed the book, but I felt that the author had gone over the top with her "evidence" of my "psychopathy".   My problem with the book is the author doesn't seem to know where her real evidence of my psychopathy comes from:  My only problem is not enough of it is actually true about me, so there's some wiggle room for the author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first part of the book is a series of letters between a man who is in love with a girl who is having an affair with his best friend, and the man who loves the girl.   These two people (one of them is the girl's father) hate each other and are unable to have a good relationship (even though they're not being "unfair" to each other).   I didn't like these letters that much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I read this book, I thought it would be good - or at least something that wasn't trash like so many of the other reviews have been.   But I was disappointed in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad example of how to start a book. The character in the first person is a terrible,   idiotic,  idiopathic,  incompetent  and   ignorant  person. The author seems to have   given up on that character so   he gets turned into a monster. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not that difficult to read or learn about.   The problem with it is that it seems to have been written in such a fashion to sell the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a very poor excuse for a novel.   I felt cheated after a great first half; the middle half was dull and tedious. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole book is full of stupid ideas that I wish I could just forget about.   I guess that is what happens when you read a book with a title like: "If I was a robot..."   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very long book that really doesn't want to be about anything.   It's about someone who is having some difficulties, some problems.  It doesn't quite fit the story.  But, she's so full of self confidence, and so determined to get back to her former self that there is no way she's going to give up, so she will   and put her health on the line.  She's just so hard on herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time. It's full of unnecessary details and unnecessary information, and I have no idea what is going to happen next. It all seems to be done with just enough detail to avoid boring people, and not enough to add up to anything. I don't even think the people I've seen wearing t-shirts from this book will recognize them as t-shirt makers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the original, and found this reread more tolerable.   The writing, although good, is sometimes clumsy and awkward. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's just as bad as I expected:  There are so many errors I'm surprised that even a good book like this had made it as far as it has.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like these books that have no redeeming value.   They are boring, hard to read, have many errors and errors in the wrong places   and they are all published by the same company  ... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a book that had potential, but in the end disappointed.   The story line was good,   but   it   just   wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a nice introduction to the field but the only book on it is very poor.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As the author of a very well-received book I was very excited for this one. I'm always delighted when I get a good book like this. However, the book seems a little rushed to me, with no real introduction to the characters or plot.   The characters don't really develop (unless we are talking about   Elizabeth Banks, and that's a long time coming).   I'm curious about  the relationship between the mother and son (who are  pretty  different ) but  that really doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should have been titled:    Why Do You Need a Good Hardcover Book?:    It is a very good book about the need for good hardcover books, and why I don't really care about reading in them.   In the back it tells us that the book is very long but it ends on a cliffhanger. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The badness is not too serious for a young adult book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't feel like I got a chance to learn much from this book.   It's a good little book about the development of social skills, but it could have been better if it focused more on the "why" behind some of the less-than-stellar social skills of young people.  The "why?" I think is the important part here; it really doesn't get explained, and I feel like there's a lot more we could have learned. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You know what's weird about this book?   It's a great read   but the actual writing   is terrible   The prose is so clunky   and hard to follow   This would be fine   if it didn't take so long   to get   the plot going   so   it's a bit of a chore  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was fun at times, but most of the time it was dull, repetitive, and over-dramatized.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked the book, but not the idea behind it.       I'm a fan of modern-day fairy tales (the Snow Queen is my favorite), and I was expecting to like this one, but I didn't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me a while to get to this book. The title alone is pretty terrible.  It's a little hard to get into after that, since it's pretty dry.   But it's not a bad read.  I'd recommend it, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the most disappointing book   I've read   since   The Catcher in the Rye   .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book.   It has a very good idea behind it: that a person can't be a good husband, wife, etc., if he is too self-absorbed.  It makes a great point, and it is good that she is able to use her own experiences as well as the stories of others to make her point.  The whole thing reads like a "reality TV" episode:  People are often so focused on how they look and act that they are blind to their own true strengths and weaknesses.  This book is a good reminder of this, so that we don't just let our lives pass us by. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a little annoyed at first, but then I realized how important this book is.   The main thing about the book that I didn't like was the "How-to" part; however, the book itself is just fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is very short, but so dense and boring I had to stop reading because I couldn't keep reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is so far away from being anything like the author's previous work that I almost didn't bother with it.   While it has a lot of good things going for it, it's not the book I thought it would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a long time coming.   I'm glad I finally got around to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not really a novel about a character, but a review about the book as a whole:  The plot is boring and, after spending so much time with it, the author seems to have forgotten all of the plot points that the story was about.   There were also some plot holes that were never dealt with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a good one.   The characters are cliched and over-the-top.  The action is slow and it does not seem to really be about anything.  Some of the ideas in it are not new or original.  This is an attempt to do a fantasy novel but the author is a bad writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has become increasingly evident to me that the Bible is not the book of the Bible.   The Bible does not support Jesus.  When you look into the text, it just doesn't hold up.  It is not a true narrative.  All the stories in the Bible are just legends and myths. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a guy whose friend is a rapist.   The friend is in prison,   but the friend is   a friend, so they   get along   pretty well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what to think of the new edition of Michael Flynn's   The Fall of the House of Usher.   First, Flynn's earlier editions are better, even the worst.   Second, the book is still a useful guide to the ways of America's elites. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good story is a good story.   It is also a story about love and family and growing up and coming of age.  It has some very good moments and some very bad moments.  In some way, it does not matter what happens to the good characters.  They will come out on top.  I loved the characters but had trouble connecting with them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is poorly told, and the ending is illogical. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this for a book exchange in a book store.   Unfortunately, I didn't know that it was a children's book when I bought it.  A lot of kids' books are just so darn good that you want to try reading them but can't because your mind just can't grasp the words.  The illustrations are very charming, and it's nice to see a young boy making his own books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think many people would find this very hard to live with, but it is a very good book.   It's basically just the best science writing in years, which is surprising, because the whole science scene has been so depressed lately, but I do like how this book is not afraid to give serious attention to science, not afraid of the hard things, just not scared enough to ignore them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a hard time trusting any book that claims that Jesus didn't die for anyone, but a specific group of people.   He certainly didn't do it for me.  It is not my faith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book. I was expecting it to be a bad copy of an excellent one.     The cover says it all:  I wish I'd gotten a copy of this book at my local library.  The text is dry, and very dry.  A few years ago, I took a class with a professor on the history of the book business.  This professor talked about how much he loved to buy first edition of the classics - not just the classics, but all books that were written between the first editions of The Great Gatsby and The Great Defection.  If the author had actually read that book (as the description says it is supposed to be reading), he would have realized that this is really a terrible book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the early 2000s, I read an anthology of contemporary poetry about art.   The collection's title was called "  The anthology's titlewascalled "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is not very interesting.   He is a well-meaning man but suffers from a severe case of the   classic syndrome of the good man   who is taken in by a con man.  It is as if he was forced to read about the life of a rich and beautiful woman with whom he would have an affair.  There is a great deal of sex   between   the two men and   a number of other people,   but   none of them are very interesting or even entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most egregious problem with this book is that it's a bit of an overreach to use a character like the old-timey old-fashioned man from the Bible to teach young girls about "the virtue of self-control."   Instead of telling young girls that they should use the strength and will to control their own urges and passions to control themselves, which is what Jesus tells us to do, these girls are supposed to just be grateful that someone as old and strong as Christ has the strength to teach them how to control for themselves.   Why bother going out of your way to get yourself killed, if the people who would be angry at you about it aren't even worth the trouble?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really, really like the idea of the book.   But the book isn't   any good.  It's   really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of the author.   His writing style is not my cup of tea, and he just goes through the motions.  It took me awhile to get used to the characters as it was a bit jarring to see the main character not just having a problem but being actively trying to ignore it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author fails to provide a reason why "anatomically correct" is a good thing.   It is the same argument that the anti-vaxxers use, that vaccines don't work because they are "analog"       In other words, the "anatomy" of the immune system are flawed and need to be corrected.  As a parent who is a pediatrician myself,  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, I found this book hard to follow.   The story is really short and the author does not seem to have a whole lot of patience for the reader.  It was like she was trying to get a message across with very little understanding of what that message was.  She gets her point across but her logic is completely flawed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was extremely disappointed   in   the   final    chapter   of   this   book  . 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished a book   which I enjoyed quite a bit,   but that's where the fun ended.       That is to say,  how a book is edited is   in the eye of the beholder.  The style is 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is one of those books that you have to study hard to get through.   The first 10 or 20 chapters of the book go into some interesting detail about human evolution.  The second 10 or so chapters take up a discussion about how humans evolved and became civilized.  Then, the third or so chapter is dedicated to how civilizations fall and how the collapse of civilizations is usually the first sign of a possible apocalypse.  This is the best part of the rest of the chapter! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very good in parts but badly written in other parts    This was the first book I read where I couldn't decide if the author was attempting to be a "realist" or if she was just trying to make something better by using the wrong tools.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm surprised this book hasn't been turned into a movie   It's basically the same idea as the first, but the first was much better  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished a really good book on John Locke.   It seems that all the best historical scholarship on Locke has come from John Rawls (and his theory of justice) and that Locke and Rawls are largely ignored in the modern era.  I really liked Locke and the history of Locke's ideas, but I can't get past the claim that Locke is an "imposter," or an "intellectual slave."   While Locke certainly deserves to be read, I'm a little disappointed that a lot of Locke fans don't realize how much he has been misunderstood by later scholars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't want to review anything in this book because it's so bad.   It's one thing when a book makes a claim that isn't supported by any real evidence, but this one manages to do it twice:  First, it claims that "the very high levels of serotonin and norepinephrine" in the hypothalamus (which regulates appetite) "are implicated in the genesis of food addiction".   That's silly   because they weren't linked   until the early 1970s    and then in the 1990s .   Second, it claimed that "there has been an almost complete disappearance of dopamine in the reward systems of the brain since the early 1980s"   This too is also bogus   as dopamine plays a crucial role in addiction, but it was not really mentioned in this article   Posted by Daniel at 5:00 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got the same book as my older daughter and I didn't like it. The story was weak and we felt we couldn't relate to the characters or why they were doing what they were. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very hard to understand,   even if it's the story of a small town.   It's all about the family business 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really enjoy this book at all. The author, John Green, is a really talented writer, but his stories have a lot of flaws. The ending in this story was the worst I've ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was in the sixth grade. It was about a boy who gets hit by a car and then goes through a lot of pain and mental anguish and eventually passes away from cancer. The story was horrible and the story of the boy was sad but it was a bit of a cheat. The boy dies in the hospital, so he goes back home to his parents in a dream sequence.   It's not as if he didn't suffer.  I wish the book had ended better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very well written book about the "golden age" of Hollywood.  It is a nice, well-written book about an interesting subject: Hollywood's golden age, in which studios made many films about women's roles.   It does not go into the history of women's progress. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read "My Brother, the Unpopular Professor," a book written by two people who can't stand each other...   My brother isn't just unpopular with his peers, he's the butt of everyone's jokes.   What a sad bunch they are. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read several of the new books by David Foster Wallace, and I'm finding that most of them are about writers who are less than creative. This one, however, is about the opposite:  In the end, it's about a very gifted writer who is in a downward spiral.  And the worst part is that he doesn't realize it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst things I've read in years.   In other words, a terrible, insulting book about the Christian right.  I was really excited about this book since it was written in the last year of his presidency.  It was supposed to be his "greatest failure."   It is really all about the persecution of Christians and the anti-Christ.  All the bad stuff from the religious right is included.  For example:  How George W. Bush's presidency led to the demise of the Christian Right, in part by taking away their money.  What's more, they found it even easier to go after Jews, Muslims, atheists, people of color, feminists, etc.  This book is full of factual inaccuracies and outright lies.    It is a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was really nice; I have never tried a recipe from the book, but I'm sure I'll be making a lot more of them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book isn't bad; it's just wrong.   I have spent a good bit of time in the church and have been blessed by a number of friends who have read it.  It made me want to know more about the life of the Apostle Paul.  The book talks about some of the good and bad experiences Paul had.  Unfortunately, he did not experience any of them.  I thought that a book that is so full of contradictions was a bit too much for someone who lived the life he lived.  I also found a lot of the information in this book a bit of a stretch for me.  For example:  Paul and the Gentiles did not live according to the Gentile Law of Moses.  Paul is supposed to have had a lot more Gentile converts than he did.  So a Gentile's law (and a Gentiles own "Law of Life" as well) is supposed by Paul to be superior to Moses and God's Law.  Also, Paul was considered a "Biblical Man of God."  Apparently he was supposed to be a guy who went out and "did things that other people couldn't do."  Why not live like a non-Gentile and have his own Law?  And finally, Paul's wife was supposed by him to be one of the most amazing, powerful, loving women in the world.  Why did she let him and others talk her into giving up her faith?  Why didn't she get out of her house and start helping Paul?

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the only book that has ever been helpful to me and I haven't wasted a dime.    It was an invaluable help to understand what the church was and is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was my first book.   I read it and it did nothing for me.  I'm a high school teacher so I can't compare the two.  But the stories are boring.  They are so predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was bad. It was supposed to be about the development of the internet and it wasn't.   The technology that was supposed help the world was used as a crutch. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited about this book until I finished it,   and I felt so sorry for the people who actually   love books.   It was like reading a review of a book about the   only thing I'm not sure about is how the characters are related. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought I was going to hate this book!   The way it takes the fun out of reading is sick!  I don't enjoy the dark side of science fiction! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an entertaining read, but I think it's far too long for a novel and suffers from the same kind of long-windedness found in the early works of Tolkien (who was far better at plotting than the others).   It could easily have been cut down to something shorter, but since it's included here I won't complain.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have found that this book is a classic example of how not to write a story

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book doesn't really teach you anything.   I think I read it because it's very interesting and I have some time on my hands.  I do think though that if the author didn't write such a bad books the writing would be so much better.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading about the "reward for failure" in a child abuse case.   It's written by a "survivor" of incest, a woman who grew up in a dysfunctional family with a father who is physically abusive and emotionally abusive to his children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible.  It's basically a series of vignettes from a series.  Each vignette is essentially a "torture" story told in a humorous tone.   When I say "humorous,"   I mean "ridiculous."   But, I did enjoy the series, even though they were not my cup of tea.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is very good if you just keep the book in perspective.   It shows that even if you are a very smart and knowledgeable person, you will never know everything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A disappointing first book in a series about a magical, magical, fantastical world, where all things are possible because all things (and even those not-all things) are made of magic.   I was excited for the book, because I thought I had gotten a good read in the other book (the second in the series, the fourth in the Harry Potter series).   Unfortunately, this book did not live up to that hype (I read it in January 2010 and finished it in October 2010; a bit over a year).  The plot is quite predictable, and the story is quite dull.  However, I am quite intrigued by this book, so I'll wait and see what happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so full of mistakes and so unprofessional that I could barely take it.    First of all, there is no reference to any source for the number in question.  For a book like this that is so popular, there should be one.  It's just really disappointing that it is so far off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book is a waste of time because it is a book about a failed author and his failed career.   There is not a single interesting story in the book.  He goes into the business a little too much for my liking 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book which, despite the high-tech "science", is pretty much a rehash of the old story about a scientist being mistaken for a magician in a strange desert town.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I enjoyed The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I can't get over the fact that the whole book was "just in time"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really happy with this book.   It is good for an introduction to the subject, but it's much better to study the subject thoroughly before starting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While reading this book, I was disappointed at the many inaccuracies in the story, such as:  The main character is described as a good soldier, who saves the day after his platoon leader's platoon is ambushed in the mountains by an enemy that had been "bumped up" by the other two squads.  He has been through extensive combat training but was still injured, with the rest of his platoon having been killed in the first ambush.   He does not have a personal injury report, but he is said to have one.  In other parts, the narrator implies that all the characters involved are lying to cover up their own failures. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While reading this book for the first time, I felt a strong sense of personal failure:  I can't say it's a bad novel.   It's a good story.  But the only way to make sense of the story is to see the author as an unreliable narrator:  He's trying to be a good father.  He can't be a decent person.  A good father would help his children, not abandon them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband loves reading about famous people in books and on television but he hates books about ordinary people.   I bought this as a present for my brother and found out that he hated it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think anyone else can claim the success of this book.   It's a very well written story about the development of the   world   economy during the  1970s   which makes for a good read   but I was left wanting  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poor representation of a complicated and challenging subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed with this book.  I felt like I was reading a bad memoir.   From the first line "When we went to the moon, Neil Armstrong said the biggest risk we faced in space was the possibility that the moon could be a hostile environment, and we'd be in danger" to the last,   he is being too negative about the risks that the men faced on the moon.  In actuality, in space, it's extremely difficult to avoid getting caught in a nuclear war.  It is not at all clear that Neil Armstrong would have been aware of any of this.  So, is Neil Armstrong a dumb, self-centred fool who could not be bothered to read a book that was full of accurate facts and who just couldn't believe the fact that it is more hazardous to be in space than it is on the surface of the Earth?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book because I'd heard so much good about it.    While reading I got so angry at my own ignorance of the subject matter that it was kind of funny and kind of sad at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most amazing part about this book is that it was published nearly 70 years ago.   It is a great introduction to the subject, but it doesn't quite get to the key points.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book last year, and I liked it a lot. It is a very interesting look at the history of the early nuclear bomb research, which I think is still of very high interest. It has a very bad cover, however, that made me turn away.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a little put off by this book.   It sounded like a lot of things she has written before are just as bad.  She has always been successful.  This is a new start for her.  But she just cannot write a character you can really get involved with.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an amazing book, if for no other reason than the fact that the author spends a lot of time on the subject.   It's not a good book if you're a professional in any field; a better one would have been a book that deals with things professionals deal with a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, there is no reason to read a book titled "The God Who Made the World," unless it's one in which God is a jerk.   A lot of good science has come out of the Bible.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was all so predictable.   This book, which I purchased in the first place because it has been recommended to me many times, just did not live up to that name.  I am always amazed at how much time the authors spend talking about the science behind a subject (to the point of confusing it with pseudoscience) but rarely get around to actually providing the information they are so sure about.  It makes me feel like I am reading the ramblings of an overly confident, arrogant person who has just come off a particularly bad trip (or drug).   I'm not trying to be mean here.  However, I feel like this is probably not a good book for people who want the information in a more accessible way.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't stand this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If only I had known what I was missing in this book.   The main character is a bit too good at what he does:  It's as if a professional magician is not satisfied if he gets the effect he wants.  One of the things about his magic that bothers me is that he can make a perfect duplicate of anything.  Then he can sell it for a lot of money.  Or he can create something to look just like something else.  And there is one place where he did not get his desired effect.  He put a lot more energy into the fake corpse that he had made.  It still had all the hair on its body and was the same height.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first chapter introduces us to the main characters (both the main character's parents died in a fire) and we're introduced to the central character, a young woman, through a series of small conversations.   At some point, we learn that she's been in a mental hospital since the day her parents died.  She's been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  For the rest of the book, we're told what she does with her time.  Her favorite activity is "taking a hot shower."   It's a very odd book for a schizophrenic.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is like a lot of science books; they're written for a certain audience (the people who believe that climate change is a myth) and tend to repeat the same ideas and claims.   They fail to show that the most compelling arguments for the climate change claim are not based on scientific evidence, but are instead based on popular psychology. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a good example of poor reading. It reads as if it's a textbook and the professor is in the room. The teacher spends some time explaining how this type of work is not appropriate for people in the real world. Then she uses that same explanation to dismiss the idea that this type can be useful for people.   It's all fine and good, but how does this affect the student?   I'm no expert in this field but I'd say if you're reading something like this as a review for a good book, you might find yourself asking yourself:  Why does the professor dismiss this material?  It would be nice to have her actually demonstrate how it would work.  I think that the book will have the students thinking more about their own experiences and thinking about how the ideas are applicable to them.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no complaints about this book.   It is fun to read, and the ideas it presents are interesting and the science is interesting.  But       The book is very hard to understand.  This is a very long book, with many references to other texts (including the work of Richard Dawkins).   There are a lot of scientific concepts that seem strange, or even inexplicable.  There   seems  to be a lot  of "magic" in this book, which is not explained.  The main characters  appear  to  be  to some    extent   to like   the   food   they  have   (such as  jellyfish   and   garlic ).

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I    read this book when it came out.   The story line was very interesting but the plot was kind of lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is absolutely full of mistakes and lies about the history of the Vietnam War.   For example:  "The war in Vietnam was launched, and carried on by President Lyndon Johnson, as a "good faith effort" to remove a Communist regime in North Vietnam."   (I don't know if that is a real "lie" or a misunderstanding.  But it's pretty close, and it's false.)    Another:    "The conflict in Vietnam, as in Cambodia, was fueled by a perception that the Vietnamese government had become a puppet of the Communists."  It's all nonsense.  I have no idea who said that, but I don't think it was LBJ, and I don' t think it's true either.  He had no problem with the "communists" in Vietnam being "puppets" as long as he was getting paid.  Another thing:  For some reason, LBJ believes that the U.S. is better off with a small, poorly defended, poor country like Vietnam than a large, well defended, well-defended country like Japan or Germany.  There's a lot of nonsense in this book: This isn't a book about the War, or the War in Vietnam.  It is a book written to convince people that the Vietnam Wars are bad, or at least that they were bad before the War.   You can tell this is a political book because LBJ constantly refers to "the War," "the Vietnam War," and the "Vietnam War" as if it is a single, monolithic, historic thing.  This is the equivalent of saying "the Civil War was a bad thing," or "the Revolutionary War was bad."

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to learn about the history of the American frontier, and I'm very disappointed by the way the book describes its subject. The book starts out with a great deal of excitement over the opening of the transcontinental railroad, and goes on to describe many important events in the history that the book seems to ignore. The first paragraph describes the railroads as "a means of transporting goods by rail from the port of New York to the Pacific," and then proceeds to explain that it is a terrible idea. The last paragraph gives the story, but says little about what it says: "But as the railways of the west were a means of transport that brought people from across the continent to the very heart of the land, they were a valuable addition to the American heritage."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was a book I loved a lot called "The Great American Novel."

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about a year ago, and I was surprised to find it so boring.   The only interesting thing about it was the mention of a non-canonical, non-fictional, non-"real world" version of the story in the back, where a character, known only as "the Other" gets taken hostage and then escapes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason the first half is so good is that the author's characters are so likable that we can almost forget how terrible most of the people she describes are:  They are always out to steal money or food or other things they don't have.    We don't know how they got these bad habits, but we don't want to be in their place:  I would take the time to buy a few small and useful things for my house if I had to.  Posted by James at 11:35 PM

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a lot of good ideas in it but they are all presented in such a way that the reader can't easily follow the argument.   What is the point of a book like this?   Is there anything interesting in a book about something we already know and can never change?  I think it's really interesting that people have the mental capability to figure out what you are talking about.  This is interesting to me, and in fact is one of the many things that make me like books so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      In a nutshell, a very bad book.   It starts off well enough but then all the things I hated about the book come out.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the reasons I read the "My Favorite Murder Mysteries" series is that they're such a fantastic read, with excellent twists and turns along the way.   For me, the only thing that kept it from being an 8-star rating is that the last chapter felt rushed, and that the mystery involved a case that the main character (a lawyer) had to work on for months to solve.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting this book to be just like the others I've read: a typical 'the book should be a whole lot better than it is, but the way it gets there makes it suck' novel, or something like that.   Nope.  I got about two-thirds of the way through before the author made the first of the plot points about the heroine's childhood seem like a big joke.  It was not funny, just awkward and out-of-place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As I was listening to this book, I found myself thinking about some of the most popular books of all time:  The Catcher in the Rye   The Great Gatsby   These are, of course, all about "ordinary" people going through ordinary, everyday problems.  But in this book,  a  very  eccentric  family   manages to live by the "law of the jungle"   in the form of a very  unusual   method of raising its young.   It's just so funny   I don't think it's very well written, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a good example of the kind of pseudo-scientific stuff that is so popular at the moment.   The premise of the book is that the first language (Latin) is dead and dying because it lacks a common root that is the basis for many other languages.  While this is not true, the thesis is completely misleading.  Many languages have a common  root with a long history, but are still distinct   It's true that most languages (like English) have borrowed words from each other.  Latin was the first major source of borrowing in Europe.  But other languages were also borrowing from it in the very earliest periods.  Some languages have borrowed much more from Latin than English.  In a paper titled, "Rethinking the Indo-European Roots of the European Languages"   (which is available on-line as well as in a book)  I explain how this happened and how it can explain languages that are not Indo- European.     I have used it as the basis of my own work in developing a theory of the Indo European language family.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts out okay with lots of information and useful information, but in the first 5 or so chapters it becomes very clear that the book is about a little boy who has a mental breakdown.   He has a dream in which he is the star of a movie and he is going to be a famous movie star like Marlon Brando or Gene Wilder or something.  This is a good idea, and the movie is amazing (especially when you consider how weird it is)   But the book keeps coming at him with ideas about him having no control over his life, so he spends the whole movie acting like a crazy person.  That makes him even more crazy, and makes the movie seem even more absurd.  So the story seems to be about a crazy child being crazy, but it ends up being a silly book about a stupid child.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this book is about the first two years of her first real marriage, after two years dating a guy who wanted to get married. And it's about how she decided to end the marriage. But the most depressing thing is that she did end the relationship.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading several reviews about this book, I feel like I'm reading some of the bad reviews that the book's author receives.   She uses this book as a "study guide" on how to become "the person who knows the answers to any question, from how to dress to how to behave in a courtroom."   What this does is teach her readers that it doesn't matter if the person she is dating (the girl she was living with) is smart, she is still not the "right one" for them.    It does this by saying that "all women are good at finding men who are good enough for them, but not so good for men who need them".   This is where I start to get uncomfortable about the author's "study guides".  I am not trying to be a "girly-girl" by saying this, but is this not exactly the same as a woman telling a man that they are a good "buyer, seller, and driver" when it comes to buying a house?   It is not always how you look, but what you are like in the bedroom.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like the way the main character is so much more interested in the romance than he really should be.   He's so into the fantasy that he's willing to risk dying at the hands of monsters who are clearly more attractive to him than he is.  The way he loses his memory is lame too.  I would have made the story better if they hadn't dropped the main couple right before the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed with this book because it does not have any new insights into the way people think about themselves and their place in the world   It is not about how to think about the world but about how people think   "The world will always exist and, eventually, some people are going to be the ones who say it did not   That is an interesting idea    And, in its way, the thesis is the opposite of the view held by people who live outside America   The people who say the world will not last   will be wrong  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed reading it, but I had a lot of difficulty getting past the author's opinion about feminism.   The fact that most women's lives are actually pretty good compared to men's is a nice thing that they can boast about when it's not the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a problem with some of the negative reviews I've read about this book.   One says, "A poorly organized collection of essays."   Another says,  "The book is a disjointed mass of contradictory ideas.  The central idea of the book, and its central criticism, is completely ignored."  A good book is difficult to understand.  A bad book is very easy to understand.   This book is both. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After all the good things I said about this book before I read it,   I can't give it 5 stars anymore because   it wasn't that good after   all that I liked about   the first one.   There are a few good things in it, such as   that the characters are as real as you could want in a novel,  but   they didn't do anything interesting or memorable   and I didn't really care for a lot of what they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent book on the theory of relativity, but the title is misleading.   It is not an explanation of relativity as such, but rather the relationship between spacetime, the curved spacetime Einstein developed to account for special relativity, and the curvature of space itself, the so-called "flatness of space."   The "flat" part is of course just the space is curved to match the curvatures of everything else in the universe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I purchased the audio edition of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment   and was very disappointed   - it's an abridged edition   that   has everything removed   (it contains passages that were originally in the original that are now missing   - i.e.   the discussion of   Tsarist   system,   in which Dostoevsky is very critical   of the   bureaucracy, which he describes   as   "             a                  a              a     ",   while the author   is   dismissive   towards   Dostoboyevskys   view of    society  ,   which he   argues   against   by   citing   Stalinist   purges  )   but   no   new material   either   original or   abridgement   to   justify the abridgment   or   the abatement

Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a reader and a writer, I found myself feeling annoyed and disappointed by the ending.   It's a fairly typical 'what if the protagonist dies' ending for a post-apocalyptic story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I was looking for a new perspective on the war, and the authors mention a number of places in the book where they have interviewed veterans to see if they were telling the truth about the Vietnam War and the effects on them.   There is one part that really angered me.  The author interviewed a Vietnam veteran that had been stationed in the field for two years and was told to report every one of the men who was in his platoon as a Viet Cong (I was in the same platoon for a year)   He did so and ended up with the most Viet Cong in his unit, which is when he got a bad case of malaria.  In the book the veteran claims that he only got malaria once, and even so it was a lot worse than he thought it would be.  I would think that even with malaria the Viet Cong would still get a better case of it than most people would.  This is a pretty common experience for a soldier returning from the war 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would give this book a negative rating but in my opinion, a bad read, too.   First off, it is so badly written that it makes me cringe just reading it   The first 40 or so pages are so bad that I lose all interest in the book.  After about page 50, the prose completely loses all sense and becomes a bit of a bore.  I know this book is an autobiographical work, but the author really doesn't have a very good grasp on reality.  As a result, he's unable to really convey his feelings.  It seems that the authors parents were abusive, he blames himself for it, but he is unable to come to terms with it.  This is just a rehash of the previous paragraphs  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was okay.   I was a little annoyed at the end, but it was mostly because of the bad ending that didn't make sense.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been reading The Magic of Thinking Big by Peter Drucker for a couple weeks now.  I read a bunch of books about management and productivity, but this one stands out as the most useful.  Drucker's approach to solving a common problem that is central to all large organizations:  The problem is that people don't really like to be told what to do.  They don't like to spend their days working hard, but don't want to be held accountable for their work.  People tend to be highly independent and they prefer to take responsibility for their own actions.  The way to deal with this problem is to allow people to do their own thing, but provide them with the mechanisms (budgets, quotas, targets, etc.) to accomplish their own goals.  You can't force people to behave, but if you give them a lot of freedom, they will learn to behave.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I saw the cover of this book, I was expecting a lot more from it. I'm a very avid fan of both The God of Small Things and The Da Vinci Code. But in this book these authors have so little to say, that I'm surprised that this is a best seller.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, this is a book about a child who died. Not the kid who was sick at school, or the kid in school who died and had a brain tumor, but the kid (his sister) who was killed, who never had a chance.   The mother tries to move on with her life, but it doesn't go very well, because of the death and all the people who knew about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read many good books in the past few years, but this one was just way too much.   It seemed to be a bit of a "gotcha" book that was just going to give you all the information you needed.  And this was a "get" for many folks who don't know the whole story but wanted to have a peek to see how the game is played. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book because my friend's book review group was discussing a novel.   They had a good time discussing the novel and had a lot of positive things to say about it, but I kept getting the feeling that they were comparing this book to  The Little Stranger, and not realizing that this is an entirely different novel. It's a much more interesting novel with lots of interesting twists. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about the creation of a new, better world. But, sadly, the book doesn't even begin to describe that world.   What we get is a long introduction to different countries where this idea is being discussed.  The whole book is like that.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is good.   It is clear that the author is not an accomplished historian, but a student and writer.  Unfortunately, he does not even realize his mistakes, or what he might have learned, during his fieldwork in the mid-20th century, which is the only time he mentions any African-Americans or Afro-Americans in the book.  He writes:  "There is no mention in these studies of the numerous studies of blacks in the Civil War era that show that blacks had no military ability, no discipline, and no ability to take command."   In one chapter, he mentions the work of one of the field directors, Robert W. Anderson.  Yet he does nothing to substantiate the fact that he is the first to use the term "black-and-white" Negro soldiers in the Army of the Potomac.  If anyone should know, it's Anderson, as he is responsible for much of the work that came to be known as The Negro Soldier.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back in the late 90s, around the time I was a sophomore in high school.   It is a very interesting book about the early days of the Beatles.  The authors describe the early life of John Lennon and Paul McCartney as follows:  John Lennon:  "He was a wild child.  He was always on the go.    He was a loner.  John lived a solitary life for most of his life."  Paul McCartney:    " He would often say he was like a wild animal that didn't know if it was going to make it through the night or not.  I don't know why he was so depressed.  And he wasn't just an emotionally lonesome person, he had a dark side."  They also discuss the impact Paul had on the Beatles:  Paul:  I think he's the only one that really gave the feeling that it was a great group and all the others were just a bunch of clowns.  Paul was really a catalyst, it seems, in making the band the way they were.  When Paul joined the group he was already a successful musician, but he didn't play up until after the Beatles had already been together for a couple of years.  Then they started to get more popular.  The Beatles had a long way to go before they really took over the music world.  " Paul:  I think the other thing that Paul did, was make them more likeable to the public."   The book also describes their early problems:  In February, 1966, Paul was so ill that he had to be hospitalized.   While Paul was sick, John and Yoko got a date to spend the weekend together in Paris.  Paul:   After Paul had had a couple days to recuperate he returned home from the hospital.  As he came in he could hear Yoko singing with John and on the second day he said they had to go to the concert.  They were going to see the Beatles and he wanted to accompany them.  It was Paul's idea that the Beatles should go to London and see the Rolling Stones.  George:  When they got to the hotel Paul looked pale, he was very frail.  His teeth were so bad that he couldn't open his mouth.   And Paul had to sit down for the rest of the weekend.  A few days later Paul was back to normal but he was

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good story but unfortunately has some glaring problems:  The author, a medical doctor, describes how his wife developed severe abdominal pain after the birth of their first son.   She asked him for a prescription, but he was reluctant to fill it:  - The doctor wanted $150,000 and he wanted it by the end of the month.  -  His wife couldn't get the $150k, so he ended up taking a deal on a $2k pill instead.  I suppose this is what a lot of doctors do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was a teenaged girl, this book was one of the books that got me excited about going to the library and reading.   I found it so compelling because it portrayed young adults (especially high school seniors) going through the motions of college life without really understanding why they needed to go to college.  It was the perfect combination of high school and college. So I was very disappointed when I read the last five pages and realized that nothing had been learned about college in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would give this book a B+. It's a bit of a bore, but still worth reading. It's just about the worst book I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As I read the book I kept thinking:  Who gives a flying fuck if it's any good or not?   The story's premise seems dubious at best.   You'd think that a group of people would have an unspoken code about not speaking about each other's private issues.  What's worse:  The author was the author   -   he probably wanted you to buy it so he could keep writing   He's just trying to sell books   And it's been out of print since the early 90s   A good novel about a group that knows it can't get anything done, but doesn't want to be alone

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just got back from the library and found a new book for my husband, which he has been begging me to get him since he started reading it.   For my money,   it's a little more enjoyable than   "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"   The book is full of the typical Hollywood cliches:  As if it were the last one:  The ending.  The characters.  They're all idiots and   bad guys, except for the "hero".   Not sure   why a man is so good at   making people want to believe he can help them when he doesn't.  And there are a lot   of plot holes and inconsistencies in the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first book I've read that I would not recommend for a young adult.   The author's use of words like "blessed" and "foolish"   are all over the place.    They seem to have been chosen   from a hat   by the author   on the basis of their familiarity   with   the   style   of   prose   he   has   used   in   his   books . 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only way to enjoy the novel is to take the words as they are written.   While there are some great descriptive moments in the book, and the author does a great job describing what it's like to go through a drug and alcohol abuse,   There are also several scenes in this book that are completely unengaging or just plain annoying.  The scene in the hospital,  where the main character is trying to get a good night's sleep and can't seem to get enough sleep is infuriating at best.  She doesn't get enough "recovery sleep".   When her roommate calls to tell her to go home because he's had a hard night,  she's still not sleepy enough to listen.  Her roommate calls again after one more unsuccessful attempt to get her to sleep, then hangs up.  You can tell the author was trying to make the scenes as intense as possible, but the way the characters acted just pissed me off to no end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a really bad time with this book.   First of all, I never liked this author (she's a woman writing a man's book).   The fact that it's a young girl's diary is really   stupid.  She never   even bothered to ask for   permission before writing it.  They should have just   used a photo for her diary and   changed the name.  As   well as   annoying,   her voice is not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really expecting a good book from these authors,  but instead  they made it worse than I expected.    They basically claim that it is okay to do anything to kids if the kids are  too fat or too thin ,  which   is  totally   ridiculous.  These   people should be ashamed  of   themselfs, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, I spent two whole weeks reading it and never managed to understand the concepts he presents.   I don't understand it because he makes so many different points at different times   He tries to prove that you can learn a lot by reading books in a particular area   (and he's right at many points)   But the book itself is a complete waste of time  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you really want to understand what happens to men's lives in a post-9/11 world, read the first three chapters of the book (there's a lot about the Bush administration), and try to imagine the way the world will look to men who had been part of that system: the secret wars, the torture and rendition, the indefinite detention without charges, the endless drone strikes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say that this was a disappointment.   A lot of the reviews here are from people who were given the book as a gift:  In the end, the book lacks a sense of humor:    the main character, an idiot, is unable to make a cogent argument and is constantly confused, while at the same time his stupid behavior is a major plot device.  (See The Manchurian Candidate.)   It does, however, have an interesting premise:  There is a new breed of women who can't take a joke.  In addition to being a great book, this book was a good lesson: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is all wrong:  It's all about how people think about things.  It says that the way people think is that they can be convinced about the truth of something by just looking at a picture or two.  People who do not have a logical mind can easily be persuaded that a picture is a picture, or that their "lazy" ways are normal.  But there's no logic.   People are not just persuaded about the right way to live, they are persuaded about being right.  The problem is that the author knows how to use a picture.  That's because she is also a picture and has learned how to put things into pictures to make them seem as they are.  If she hadn't done that, the book would not have made any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was going to read The God of Small Things, but then I got the feeling the author was trying to do some poor soul's writing by adding the word "small" to the title.   Not that this is a bad novel by any means, but I'd say it's a "meh" one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of the usual "magic-bullet" anecdotes and anecdotes about magic - but they don't do a great job of capturing what a magic bullet actually is.   The first paragraph says:  This is the most entertaining book about magic I have ever read.  The whole book is written like a personal statement that is just too self-indulgent and unserious to ever be true.  It's written as if the author has a knack for putting himself out there and is going to surprise people with some new discovery about the workings of the mind.  He doesn't.  You can't really buy a "magic bullet" - there's no magic involved.  But it is possible to take the concepts of an invisible force and apply it to specific circumstances and problems.  These examples are just that - examples. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an excellent primer on the political history of the 20th century. It includes the most important events in the 20 years of the Great Depression and World War II, and does a fine job of explaining each major event as it unfolded.   Unfortunately, the book is written with a pre-conceived set of conclusions that are difficult to accept. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In fact, the plot of The Last Supper is so weak that the entire work becomes a bit of a slog.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the book suffers from a basic misunderstanding about why people don't like a genre book, and the book's over-simplification of the genre.   First of all, there are many genres.  Some of them are "low-brow" or "lowest form" (see above).   For example, the mystery/thriller category has very low ratings from mainstream readers.  One of the biggest problems with this genre is that the main character (in my case, the heroine) is a total failure.  She is so bad that she is a threat to the whole genre, and therefore a threat not only to the main characters, but the main audience.  There is a big gap between the "low" and the "bottom".  Also, this book suffers greatly from its length.  I was expecting a lot more from a short story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's pretty bad.   As far as the story goes, it's not bad at all.  It has all the necessary elements of a good fantasy novel: the hero and his quest; the magic and its mysterious workings; the dangerous creatures that live there; and a nice little adventure at the end.  I'm not sure how it would be used in a book: the magic was used by the hero to turn a dead man into a living one.  The only problem I have is the lack of resolution:  It was mentioned that the hero wanted to return to his kingdom, but how would he get back?  It seems that he'd have to ride a long distance through a dangerous forest.  Not to mention that there was an entire book devoted to his quest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The whole book was very disappointing.   There were some very good ideas in here, but they are just a bit too far removed from my experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very disappointing and bad book.   The writing is not professional and is not well-written.  I felt that he was going out on a limb for the novel and trying to "get" a reader to get his point.  The ending is unsatisfying, as well.  Also, he tries to force the story into a "moral" framework which I don't think is true.  He says that if you don't get "this" in your life you will die.  But I don 't get "This" at all.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    After trying to read a lot about Buddhism and having a good number of interesting conversations with the right people, I found this book really just more of the same:  I think it's fair to say that I'm not an enthusiastic Buddhist.   I'm skeptical of all religions, and I'm a fan of the American Dream and the American dream is based on self interest.  So, as a fan, I'm all for this.  But as a person who wants to live the American ideal, I can't stand this whole "worship your self" thing.  I don't worship my self.  The very idea is self-centered.  It's very much like the idea that people should live up to their own standards, which is one of the problems with the Buddhist idea.    I don't think that's true.  This idea that we should live out of self-interest is, in fact, true. It's the reason that self-sacrifice is seen as a virtue: because it's self-interested.  Because we do it because it benefits us.  We sacrifice our own happiness for another, but we do so because it allows us to live up that same self-image.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would love to have some more insight into the mind of a woman like this.  I have been married for nearly 15 years.   At the time of the first affair, she was dating another man.  But, I was not.  At all.  This woman is completely unhinged.  She will not take "no" for an answer.  In fact, I think she wants a divorce so badly that she is taking the legal route.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In some ways, the book is bad: the prose is poor, the plot is predictable, and the characters have poor motivation.   It's a poor book in a bad year; bad writing in general, I believe, has become much more commonplace in recent years, and I think this book fits in this trend.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're one of those people who can't stand anything with a male narrator, you'll probably hate this book.   What makes it so bad?   One character, a pretty girl who lives with her mother in a bad neighborhood, has an affair with a guy she's seeing at her job.  She's supposed to have a crush on him but can't because she's so pretty.  They are living together, but I'm not sure the dude would be satisfied with his ex-girlfriend who's so beautiful as long as she doesn't have sex with other guys.  That's pretty sexist of me.  Another character is very shallow and pretty much nothing but an accessory, and a lot of the romance comes from that.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me 3 weeks to get around to reading this book.   When I was a teenager, my dad's favorite author, Joe Abercrombie, gave us the best book on his list about the world we lived in and how we ended up living there:  "I don't understand what the point is of having a job that doesn't have any meaning. I'm a professional writer.  I've done it since I was 15.      If there is a point to the job of a writer, it's in that the writer has an emotional investment in their work.  A job like this should be a full-time job.  But  the  writer doesn't see it that way.  Because it's too hard,  there's too much waiting,  and  there is no guarantee  that  you'll get a job  in this field.  We're trying to write the best books possible,  so  the only thing we can do is make as good a product as we can,  until  we get caught in a trap  that's impossible to escape.  This is why we must  be so creative   to find ways  to keep ourselves sane   but we'll never be able to overcome   our   addiction to   the job. We're  doomed   We can't get out

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited about this book.   In the description of the book, the author says that he got his PhD to study the impact of climate change.  But my interest in this book was piqued only by a negative note about the book on Wikipedia:  The first sentence states: "The book is a critique of the'manmade global warming' theory, which it contends is a political scam designed to distract the world's attention from the real problems of poverty, health care, hunger, and environmental degradation."   Unfortunately, even the Wikipedia reference I got was so biased that I would be inclined to throw this book out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book   that I have ever   read  . The plot   was weak   and the characters   were   bland   I wanted to throw   the book out   but I   couldn't   do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first heard about "Ain't I a Woman?   I found it a bit tedious, and there was nothing that made me really want to read it.   It seemed to be more about the author's own experience of being a woman than her experience as a medical student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poorly written book.   It is written by a very intelligent, articulate, well-intentioned person who has made a significant discovery.  She knows all about "what" an organism does to its environment,  but still can't see how it can do   things that her observations don't support.  This  is  unusual and a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for the first time about ten years ago.  I felt that it was a mediocre book: it was well-written, but not a very good book, and it was not as good as it could have been.  It was interesting, however, as a first-rate introduction to the writings of John Howard Payne, who wrote the series about the American Revolutionary War.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "exorcist" is a very good author, with lots of useful information, but is in fact a bad exorcist.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first read the first chapter of this book, I thought, "Wow, this guy really writes the way a true fan would..."     He writes as though he's writing a fanfic -- in which case, it's hilarious.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be nothing more than the same old "get-rich-quick-in-a-short-time" story told over and over again.   It's a bit too slow to keep up with, and the people are boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a long series of chapters on an old book that I never read.   There is nothing of interest in the book except for its title and the author's pretensions   and I don't care to waste my money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an excuse to read the classic novel about the first American president, Alexander Hamilton  ,   and, as such, a lot of fun.   However, it is not as good as The Last Samurai  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was fine, but the ending left me wanting a lot more.   It's supposed to end when two characters are together, and she makes it clear that she wants to live in New York, not Miami.  But that's just a couple of chapters from the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is really bad but the narrator's voice is the bad part.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book contains little or no knowledge of either literature or English language, and the entire effort is wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favourite book on the subject of sexual abuse. This is the book   I   would recommend to anyone with a daughter under 21 who   is   sexually   abused   by a family member  .   The reason   it   is   good     is  because it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the best example I've found yet of the dangers of over-simplification in books.   In my opinion, the book starts with a very good premise, one that will likely be lost on many readers (and many authors).   First, it's worth noting that there are multiple types of learning:   (1)  It's about the process of learning, not the result   (2)   It is about the way in which one learns   If a child can't do something he or she knows how to do, then it doesn't matter what that something is.  The only way to find out what a child   is really good at   it's to look at how he or   she is   doing   There are a lot of   "how to" books out there,   but   only   one   that is a real "how" book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a flawed book that has a lot of good ideas but no practical way to implement them. The problem is that he has never found a good reason for why a "good" idea in a book should work or how it might be adapted for use in real life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book about a very flawed character. I think the reason that this book is a success is that it is a very good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't want to spoil this book for you.   You might as well give up on reading, because you will never get the full enjoyment out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not get much out of this book.   The story is great, but the characters were flat and had little depth to them.  This is not a bad thing though because the author did a wonderful job with the illustrations. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author gives us a picture of a great man, not the great man he was. I never thought I would feel this way about a book before, but it's good to know my negative feelings were not because of the quality but because of me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I'm not a big fan of the book. I've read it three times but still couldn't get into it.   It's really hard to connect to any of the characters in it. Maybe this is just a bad case of "too much information", but it takes an awful lot to keep a reader from becoming bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a science fiction fan I am disappointed.   If you've never read a Star Trek book before, this one will be a bit tough for you.  The whole book is a big rehash of the first book and the ending is a let down.  In particular, the ending about the time travel seems like a bit of a waste of time, because we never do find out what happens to the main character after that time.  If this had been the end of the book I would have been satisfied. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible.   In a great book, you are forced to take a step back to see how things got so bad.  Instead, you sit back, take it in, and get angrier about the system.  What a horrible book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It took about a year to get around to reading this book.   I don't really feel like I learned a ton about my favorite animals from this book.   The cover is great but I'm not sure I'd want it on my shelf   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's very difficult for me to understand what the author was trying to say.   I guess she was trying not to be "dreadful"   but she obviously failed  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book as a Christmas gift but I will never read another one of his books.   The author is a very good writer but his grammar is so bad and he has so many spelling mistakes that I don't understand how he is able to get his work published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought the book as an   free sample from a   publisher.    As it turned out  ..   It was a pretty bad   book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a lot of bad books out there.   I have read a lot that I like.  There is one book that is so bad I can't believe it got published.  I don't know how else to say it.  It is a textbook of bad fiction.  What's more bad is that he tries to make it interesting as well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should not have been written.   It is based on a false premise.  The premise is that the Jews were the original colonists of North America.  But this is false as well, and is a straw man.  It appears that the settlers of North and South America were in fact the descendants of the Hebrews from Egypt.  A very important point to understand is that America was the cradle of western civilization, and that the very first Europeans came there with the intention of establishing a Jewish colony.  Thus, the Jewish colonists did indeed establish a colony in North America, but not to the exclusion of other European colonists.  This is an important point, since this book is trying to portray American history as Jewish-centered.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My friend got me this book in exchange for a copy of The Unnatural. She had read the first half and had a lot of problems with the second. I went into this book expecting to have more trouble with the ending.   The book starts out promisingly enough. It's a new spin on a classic myth.  In the past, some powerful people have tried to use their powers to control others.  They have tried, and failed, to use these powers to stop a war between two tribes.  At the beginning of the book, a king tries to prevent the war, but he is soon overcome by his powers.  The other powers in the book are related to this same problem.  A person who is born with a superpower may have a hard time controlling it.  After a few months, that person can begin to learn how to use the power, but they may find that it's hard to control.  I thought that this problem with powers was a good idea.  It makes the book less mysterious and easier to understand.  As for the ending, I think it was written in a way that would make the reader expect the same problems to happen again.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My friend and I read this when it was first published.   It is a longish review of a long book, with a lot of criticism about the book's poor and inaccurate use of the English language.  It took a long time, however, for my friend to realize that the problems with the book were mostly in the writing and the grammar.  The writing is pretty good in some parts, especially when dealing with complicated ideas, but  most of the time the writing is completely unnecessary,  and the punctuation and spelling problems  are more annoying  than annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like reading about old stuff when I can find new stuff.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As for the novel, it's about a guy that thinks he has it all.   The first half is about his attempt to be a more responsible son, and he's doing pretty well at it.  He takes good care of his younger sister, plays the piano, is very responsible in his relationships, and has great ambitions.  When he gets a letter from a girl that he has a crush on,  he  really  doesn't know how to react.  In the last quarter he gets caught up in all of the stupid, unnecessary, stupid  things he has to do with his girlfriend.  I couldn't even finish reading this book before I just tossed it and  gave up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't understand why the author is trying to get a bad review.   One is so much better than the other. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the first book in a trilogy about a girl in love.   Unfortunately it's as shallow as you'd expect:  - the main character is very unhappy about her love life  - she's not interested in sex, she wants to do it because she's lonely  - there's a lot of sexual tension, not enough romance  - when she and the boy she's in love with sleep together, it's not for a few minutes  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was supposed to be the first book in a series about the early days of the CIA, but the author chose to go into a lot of detail about the CIA's operations in Korea, which had a pretty huge effect on his story.   The book is basically about an agent in the intelligence service who gets a good idea and decides to use it to spy on his superiors, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book, but it's a terrible example of the "one book is enough" attitude that a lot of self-help authors tend to have.  The book is filled with stories about people who were able to overcome their problems through a single key factor: They realized that they weren't like others, so they ignored their weaknesses and focused on their strengths   It's not that it's not possible to improve yourself, it's that this book has nothing to add to the discussion   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In spite of the very good and interesting parts of this book (I found the last section a little disheartening), it just didn't grab me. I liked the story about the shipwreck, but thought that it was a bit contrived.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've always felt that most science fiction is about the problem of having too much money.  This is probably a more accurate description of the book as a whole.   The idea of a world-conquering race of humanoids with all the benefits of space travel, but with an enormous tax bill every year, is a bit like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for a science fiction conference.   What I got was a series of bad ideas and bad methods.  I don't mean to say that this book is unreadable (it's not), but it is very poorly written and there are just too many bad ideas.  The book's premise is that a man discovers a way to get more information about people's brains from a brain scan; I thought it was a bad way to learn more about a person's thoughts than from a simple conversation.  There are two big problems with the book: (1) It's unrealistic in assuming that the brain is going to reveal information that can't be found in the usual sources; (2) The fact that this is done in such a way that it could be used as a basis for developing computers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many errors in the structure and grammar, but it is a good summary of the subject and a good introduction to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is too slow to be fun.   My students would be better served by more interesting texts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most interesting thing I learned about this book was that the authors, in their defense, say the book was written to defend a man who was "troubled" by a "secret" affair he had in the 1950's.   So that's probably why they wrote it as a negative book, I suppose.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending wasn't what I was hoping for and it was a waste of time reading.   I'm really disappointed in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am glad I finally found an author who does not waste a lot of time and effort writing about things that have nothing to do with the subject in which he is writing. This book is a bit like that:  The author describes his life to his readers:  For my last twenty years, I have been living a lie.  I have kept a low profile, working as an executive for a large engineering firm.   The reason is simple:  I don't want to be known as a crackpot.  My father and mother both thought I was nuts about the whole alien abductions thing at some point in my childhood.  But my father passed away before I got a good look at the evidence and decided against it.  The fact is, I spent many years following up on rumors in the UFO community, and while my interest in the subject faded somewhat, I never stopped researching, or even trying to debunk, every bit of evidence I could find.  Until I did.  In 1994, a friend suggested that we attend a "secret" UFO convention to which I was invited.  That was just what we were doing.  They were trying to "close the book" on the UFO mystery, and their convention was the last place they thought to look.  As the days of the convention passed, we started to get reports of strange things going on all over the place.  It wasn't until the end that we discovered how serious this was.  We left that convention a few days before it closed, hoping to talk to more people about what they had seen.  For a while, we tried to contact our sources and contact some other researchers who were supposedly active in the field.  Most of our attempts were rebuffed, but eventually we located some people who worked in a university that did a study on the subject.  These were some of the people that the "official" researchers had talked to.  Unfortunately, after a few weeks of trying, we realized that all they really knew about the subject was a very limited, unofficial account of what the official researchers had heard from various witnesses.  What was most frustrating about this was that a lot was being said about different aspects of the subject that was completely unsubstantiated.  One of these things was the idea that flying saucers were an actual advanced type of UFO.  This theory was being pushed by the official UFO researchers at that time.  When we met a couple of them

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for something good for my kids to read after the summer reading is over.   Unfortunately, it seems as though no matter how hard I try, I can't put my kids into a good book.  The bad:  It seems to me that most of these young kids (and adults) are going to have trouble in college. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a very interesting case I had in college.   There was a student at the college that I was teaching in a class of undergraduates.  He was a bit odd, but he had some very interesting stories that he had to share.  Some were about some really  crazy  things  he had done, and others were about   the times he found himself in trouble.  The one time he got into a bit of trouble he had stolen a       car   he thought he could sell it.  While looking for it he was pulled over by the cops.  After getting out of the   handcuffs he turned to the cop   and said, " I did it,   but   you caught me."

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last few pages of this book really are just a mess    - I have a huge amount of respect for Ms. Goffman - but here's a case where the results don't make much sense   If you think Ms. is making a big deal about the fact that she interviewed some of the same people multiple times, you might want to give her a break 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I enjoyed this book, I'm disappointed that it is a hard work to get out of my head after a while.   I would be more comfortable reading a more accessible book like this: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased a used copy of "The Art of Getting Rich" (by a fellow from New York, not New Jersey) for a hundred bucks, thinking it would be a fun read and would show some things about my "self-interest" that I hadn't thought of before.   But it's too long and too boring to be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review of Howl's Moving Castle is that it is both a disappointing book and a very poorly written one.   This was not the book I expected or wanted to read.  This is an adaptation by the author of a fairy tale, which is a genre that I've never liked much; I'm probably not alone in that.  But this adaptation doesn't do it any favors either.  The prose is too thick, and I think this is a mistake.  I don't mind a book having a complicated plot, and this is not one of those books; I liked the book in spite of the complexity.  Unfortunately, what I had hoped for here wasn't achieved. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So sad.   This is just not that good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is another disappointing book.   In fact, the book is so bad, that I felt compelled to say something.  One of the most glaring flaws in the book, is the lack of any real evidence.  The author makes the claims without any supporting evidence.     The claims about the "scientific" evidence for the earth's age, are simply unfounded and are never repeated by anyone.  Also,  The idea that the "Bible and scientific" are in disagreement is ludicrous.  Creationists will say that God is in a different time zone to when the Genesis was written.   It's true, but I think that the argument in Genesis is that the earth is 6,000 years old (I don't know where the author got this idea, but it's not backed up by the evidence).  This argument makes little sense to me.  I think it's better that the Bible is consistent and consistent in everything it says, than that it makes up things that we don't need. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book that I wanted so badly to read.   I tried to give it three stars but could never get past the fact that the author didn't really try hard to make the story work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I enjoyed it, the plot kept getting more convoluted and confusing.   After a good amount of reading the author mentions that she's going to try to get away from her addiction for good, but in the last page she's suddenly in another city and trying to get to her hotel in the morning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is by far the worst book I've ever read.   The writer has a terrible sense of humor (like most people), and makes all of his other points completely wrong.  He talks about how important good character is and how bad character is ruining the world, but then says "I don't know what to do with that."   He doesn't even realize that he is the bad character at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not very good.   Not as good as   Goodreads's   A Man, A Love,   but still worth a download. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've always been a huge fan of the Harry Potter books,   but   this   book   is a huge let down.   It   starts   off   by telling the story of   Harry Potter   meeting   Mr. Weasley  .   After   the   war  ,   they   become   best friends   and   have a really   fun time   together.  The   story   of  the first   fight   in   wizard school   was   too   much   for   me.  If   it was  the main character   fighting   a lot it would have   been   better

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this a bad review on the basis of the fact that the book is full of contradictions and bad stories about different people, including a former editor (who later sued).   To top it all off, the book was published by Penguin, which is so notorious for poor production that they had to settle a patent lawsuit for $10 million because they had published a bad edition of the Bible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One problem with this book: the fact that she seems to have learned a lot more about the world than anyone else she writes about and now takes it for granted   I am not sure why this book is so popular.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book.  I'm really surprised I liked it so much.   At first, it sounded like it might have some interesting things to say about the role of politics in shaping art and culture but didn't have the same kind of impact.  However, I've since come to realize it's got a lot more to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, at the time of its publication, was a fairly standard text-book in philosophy:  I would have liked it better if the author had spent some time thinking about the question of whether the existence of a being such as God can possibly be proved from the existence and knowledge of the material world (for example, what about the possibility of "non-material" entities such as ghosts? and, if there is a God, why doesn't he simply eliminate them)?  This was an odd, almost unnecessary, book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea that it was written by someone who knows what he is talking about is true; I thought the book was very misleading. I also thought that it had a very bad author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a bad example of the'sugar rush' genre.  It is well written (the author is a good writer), but lacks 'oomph' and is too simplistic.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really like this book very much. It's a good introduction to the history of the First World War, but it's all too superficial for my taste.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been waiting to read a great one like this for years.    As I was reading this book,I was constantly trying to think of reasons it might not be great.  The pacing is terrible.  This is a book about a guy who is in the middle of doing things he doesn't want to do.  They end up doing it anyway.  There's a whole chapter on why the man is the way he is.  What a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time.   The authors do a poor job at illustrating the basic idea that the earth's atmosphere is in equilibrium, but the author tries to prove that by creating a bunch of phony evidence.  He fails to show how the "balance" is reached, and he provides no example of it at all.  (There's more about how the atmosphere works in the book  , but that's a topic for another time.)   As an exercise, I tried to solve the basic issue at hand, but was stymied by the lack of any real examples that I could find. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I bought this book after hearing that there are several more to come from the author.   After reading it, I have to agree.  The book has a lot of good information, but the author seems to forget things very quickly.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book after I got my master's degree and it was really painful to read.    It's about how a woman becomes a killer to end the violence in the neighborhood she grew up in   and I think this book should be called   In the Shadow of the Golden Gate
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would recommend this book to people who want to learn about the history of medicine but who are put off by the jargon and the lengthy descriptions. I have a hunch that the most interesting part of the book will be the discussion of how doctors are trained in this country. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not well written and does a poor job on capturing what the main character is really about. It is just an attempt to use the "dark side" as a way to describe the hero of a novel, which is about to lose his grip on his world when it has just started falling apart around him.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a reader, I found this book to be a waste of time. I enjoyed the story about how he and his mother met but was bored with the story after that. I feel the book was meant to be used as a tool for people to do a little research or do research on the subject in order to get better at finding information on websites for cheap.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like the premise of this book.   It seems to be based on the book called The Art of Being Single by David Halberstam.  Halbersta m       This book is about the   love of the single life but fails to deal with the    challenges that come with it.  My main problem is that Halberstreet m  is an author who doesn't seem to    have learned from his past mistakes.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of books in my life.   In fact, I don't think I've ever read one that made me want to leave my room.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a book that I liked in high school.   My father and brother liked the same book.  They each said it was dull.  When I saw the book at the library, I decided to try reading it.  It's about a girl with cancer and her friends.  I liked the book because of the cute characters.  As a medical student,   my interest is in medical problems, not romance.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half is an extended set of essays about a single piece of literature (a novel by a writer who is famous for writing about something else but isn't famous for anything else) and the second half is about the novel's effect on other writers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad that it is a crime.   It is not that a book is bad but that the author, in a rush to get a big sale out of it, wrote badly.  He seems to think that people don't want to read but just want to be entertained.  A book about a girl trying to get to know her father would have been great.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, I'm very happy to be reviewing the first-ever collection of poems written by a writer as diverse as Alice Munro. I'd expected a collection of Munro's shorter work, since it was one of her first works published, but this book is a huge accomplishment: it's a collection that, from its initial pages, establishes its own distinct voice and style, and from those pages moves on to produce a long, complex, and beautiful poem that still sounds like Munro even when read in the third person.   So why a mixed review?   Because there are a few issues with the poems that really don't fit the whole idea of Munros' writing style (or, to be more specific, with her poems' focus on the natural world).   The first is a line:  I don't know how much further away from that I could go, but it's the same as when a child is first given the first ice-cube:  It is only later that they begin to make their own.    The first half of the poem is devoted to describing Munros's first-person description of a tree she sees:  The wind in the leaves  is the wind at the window  The grass on the lawn  is grass at the foot of the trees   The water in the pool  is water in a pool   and then there's a very, very long section on a waterfall that, I think, is a bit over the top.     I'm also not sure why Munros calls the "hailstones" "waterfall crusted with snow and frozen leaves"   It sounds like a kind of flower that grows right around the edges of a pond, and that's sort of a weird thing to call the snow that accumulates on a snow bank . But then there are several other lines that might have been better, or that make me wish for more, at least in the introduction:  He found her, she was so cold  And the rain turned to ice on the leaves, the rain that fell on her face  When he found her, he found the power to do  But in the end, he found how to live without   There's another long section of this poem that could have been a bit better, but then again, this is Munros:  If you read this piece carefully, you'll notice she's got a few good lines in there.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like this book.   It is so long, and so slow and tiresome to read,   that   even for me,  a book   with a good ending,  isn't as good as  a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book is, in essence, a series of stories that can only be told in different voices: the voice of a writer who's never been published; the voice that makes him a good writer but not a good storyteller; the self-conscious voice that is not a voice, but a mask."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, although enjoyable, does little to advance the narrative beyond the end of the first volume.   For the past five years I've been trying to figure out how this book was published by a new series.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to listen to while I'm sitting in my car while waiting for my wife to get a new book.   The book is really well written, but the fact that it is written for a non-audiophile audience just makes it frustrating.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was poorly written.   The main characters were too one dimensional,   too much of the romance was not believable,  and  the love interest was just a token woman (not a woman at all).    My problem with this book was the fact that it did not leave my mind as a positive experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part about this book is the title.    It's as if you're reading the introduction to a book and you realize it's actually just a "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" book (with no mention of a million bucks).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a really bad book   If you do not believe that a story about an evil spirit is real, I do not think I need to warn you.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book!   I gave it 4 stars because it is based on a book I found in a local used bookstore, which I had enjoyed a lot.   (I didn't think about it until I read the book.)   The book had a strong influence on me, but the author's use of it made me think the author was not the right person to write a book on the topic.  The first couple of chapters are very good, but then the book veers into a series of half-baked arguments with a "consensus" view of things that are totally at odds with the real world.  In fact, the author makes no attempt to explain what a consensus view is, or how it has a basis in science.  A "conspiracy theorist" view is actually an opinion.  Instead of giving us a science based theory about it, he just tries to make a book that supports his personal views about the world. The book is filled with a ton of hyperbolic language (e.g., "the world as we know it," "the great illusion," "one great mistake of mankind," etc.), but in my view this is a bad habit for a scientist to get into, and a sign of a poor scholar.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is a waste of time.   It's a very boring story, one that could easily be described as "horror" or "sci-fi," if the genre wasn't so dominated by clichés.  It uses a good story line to tell a simple story:  A father is in a car wreck, and his daughter tries to convince him that he is dead.  The father says he's not dead, that he's just in a coma and is about to die.  This sounds pretty compelling.  But there are so many problems with the story: 1.  There's a long shot of a man getting out of a coma that shows that he has some sort of neurological damage.  2.  All the bad things happening to this man are pretty well known in other books about neuroses and coma patients.  3.  His daughter's explanation that he won't die is completely off.  4.  One of the bad guys is a very stupid and annoying robot.  5.  She talks about a real person who was in the same car crash, but he didn't die.   So the story is more about the mother's psychological problems, than about her daughter's problems.  6.  He doesn't seem to be a very good father.  7.  I don't like any of the characters.  8.  They are very stereotyped.  9.  My favorite part is the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad book:        This book is NOT a bad read - it's the only book I own on the subject of the Holocaust.   I love the way this book tells the story, and the way the writer portrays the Holocaust - it makes the subject very real and human, but it also makes the Holocaust seem very supernatural, and very strange.  It's interesting how this book got published - it took a long time, but finally the publisher saw how good a book it was and got it out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was great as far as I was concerned.   A short little book that can be read on a train or bus.    The content was solid, the writing was well done and the illustrations were nice.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a wonderful book about the dangers of an excessive, over-zealous approach to spirituality.   I'm not against the approach.  I have experienced it and had some good and bad results.  But   The book is full of holes:  It doesn't give you enough information to know for certain if your meditation practice is doing more harm than good.  This book says that one study found that 80% of Buddhist meditation students develop negative thoughts after a year and a half of meditation.  The authors, David Rose and John Rose, don't cite any data to support this claim.  They mention a study by one researcher, who concluded that the negative thoughts returned were due to an increased risk for depression.  If one of the most powerful sources of negative thought is depression, one wonders if the study was flawed, or the meditation itself.  Other studies show that the majority of people who meditate don't develop negative thought patterns.  These are not the bad meditators - these are the people who are not good at meditating.  So the negative results they've found are not due to bad meditation, they are due to something else.  But the authors don't really explain what.  It's possible that they didn't understand the findings.  And their conclusion is that you should probably give up on the technique and find something else to focus on.  Their focus on the negative effects of meditation is a little too sweeping. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a waste of money. It is only about the first few months and contains almost nothing about the later stages of the disease that eventually killed my father.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a lot of books. I used to love to read when I was younger, and there is so much good writing in these books.   But   these books    are all about what to do when you don't have any money.  This is not about   taking care of yourself, or   doing anything important.  These people just want to get by on credit   in a time when credit is hard to get.  You can't get anything done with   this attitude.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited for this book that I went out of my way to get a copy of it.  I had been wanting to try an old favorite, but wasn't sure I was going to like it. I thought I might be wrong.  It turned out to be one of those old-style detective stories that's been on my list for a long time.   The premise, of course, is that a girl is abducted in the middle of the night by a serial killer.  The killer takes a photo of her with the serial killer who then sends it to her boyfriend, who has been murdered by him.  But this is so old school that I found it hard to get into.  And while the writing is great, it's hard for me to find much appeal in it.

It's self destruction.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review: I was excited to see what she had in store for me. I wasn't quite prepared for what she produced. She begins by claiming to be a feminist, and then goes off on a rant about how women are "emotional" and "emasculated" and should be allowed to pursue their personal agendas without fear of being "harrassed or humiliated."   First of all, I don't have a problem with women wanting to pursue "personal agendas."  Second, I think it is a problem for men who want to make a political point about feminism (which is to say, a problem that has always existed, but is now being emphasized by feminists more than ever before).  Third, my feminism means that women shouldn't be expected to "embrace their femininity."  In other words, feminism doesn't mean I want women to become men and be men.  The word feminist is a misnomer, it actually means "male ally".   As a male ally, I am willing to support men's issues.   I think a lot of people are wrong in their belief that feminism is about women wanting men to "man up" and become women.  It's about women being women.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book.   It made me think about why my mother did not read to me.  She is a wonderful cook, but did not like cooking with meat.  Also, my grandfather used to keep me from eating sugar and salt.  I thought that they would be bad for me but my mom said they were good.  However, the book said sugar and fat was bad for you.  It was very confusing.  My mom kept me from trying it until a friend gave me one that was okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not just a bad cook book.   It's a bad piece of pseudo-sagery fiction about a "bad cook" who's bad at everything and is totally incapable of learning and doing anything better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as I was waiting to see my cousin for dinner.   In my mind I've read about how he would get into fights over his wife,   his mother's mental illness,  and  how he was a coward.  I thought this book would give me a good view into the world of how some men try to run away from their past.  He seems very brave and determined to get through his problems,  but I could see his past coming back to hurt him later on.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I like the idea of a good mystery story set in a bad neighborhood, I found the main character's inability to think logically annoying and unrealistic, especially in the second half when the author introduces a new character that's supposed to add a bit of realism but only makes the story more unrealistic.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book contains absolutely nothing new or useful in the field of biology.   The authors use the word "genius" too much to denote an expert  .

When I read the bl  I liked the fact that the narrator was in her thirties.  It allowed her to be in a relationship that had been going on for years.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very impressed with the book by a good friend.   He has a great ability to tell a good story and has a good grasp of history.  However, in this case, the history is almost a hindrance to the story.  It is very obvious that there were a large number of slaves who did not want to be there.  The author makes a good case that many of them were not as valuable as the white men who bought them.  In addition, the author made a case that slavery was very good for those who owned the slaves because they had a large family and a steady income.  Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with the slaves who wanted to run away from their horrible situation.  This is a case study in the "fatal flaw" in any good theory of history:

Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a first novel I had high hopes for.   It was billed as a historical novel.  In a way I think it's more like a crime novel:  As a reader, I enjoyed the story but the characters weren't as compelling  as some of the more well-developed characters.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a fan of the author's work; I feel that most of the book is "wasted" on his ramblings, in which he tells an endless series of stories (in a repetitive way, like a bad song) that have no substance, are not well-written, and make the characters seem ridiculous.   He is very, very good at his writing (which I do enjoy), but if the goal was to make his characters entertaining, he failed in my eyes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a disappointing book in a lot of ways.   There are many problems with the book.  The most egregious of these is that the author is a woman.  This has been known for a long time.  However, it's still a problem for me.  I've never been able to get past the feeling that women are written off or are somehow less capable.  In the case of "The Marriage Plot," women are actually the main players in the plot.  While this is more or less the point of "Hedda Gabler," it still feels very "manly" of the author to write it as a woman and to not do anything about it (which is also a problem with some of the earlier male authors).   I also can't get past some of her negative views about women, especially how they should be treated in marriage.  It's a pity that this can't be changed in the book but we can always read another book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not bad at all.   I've read a number of books about this subject before, and it always seemed to me that there was always something that was missing.  I found myself thinking the same thing about this book.  That is, that there were no photos.  My wife and I watched the film in high school and both agreed that the photos were the most compelling feature of the film.  It seems as though this book had the same problem.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, per se,  but there was never any mention of the photos in the book.

The author makes a lot of assumptions without evidence about Iraqi behavior.  I am not a Vietnam vet so this did not come easily.  But he was clearly not there during the war.  He claims Iraqi soldiers are good at shooting, but it is very doubtful.  There is no mention of Iraqi snipers at any time, and they are not mentioned at all in any other book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to get this book! It is so long! I was wondering if the chapters were numbered, or if it was a collection of short stories.   This is definitely a great book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a good example of why no one should listen to anyone who says they can write good books for the   genre.   For the most part, the book is just a collection of random sentences.  They are presented as  a book but the fact that it is presented as a   book is disappointing.  It is written by a group of  writers who seem to have had a long running feud with   the entire book industry   from the 80's to today. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is good, and it's a good introduction to the subject. But the idea that there is "no such thing as a purely scientific research study" is just as nonsensical as the idea "there are no such things as ghosts".
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not a bad novel in its genre, or a bad historical novel in a different genre, but it is a bad one that makes me think that the book's author did not read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was so good in many ways - about God, about God's plans for the world, about the power of grace, about being a Christian, about how bad the world is - that it was more like a good bad book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure it will change the way I think about the Bible.    But   the Bible is not a text I can read for pleasure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is over-the-top, but its over-blown stories have a basis in reality: the drug that gave her superhuman strength.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read it in the "new" section of a bookstore, after finding it in a box of used books.   It is a really bad book.  It's like a young child who is trying to impress adults by inventing stories, and gets lost and stumbles all over the place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book, despite all its praise from some people who I have a good sense of and respect for: the author is a "great writer", but "if she writes well about ordinary people, it's only average.   If she writes great about people of whom you disapprove, it would be great.  I was so impressed with her writing style that I read "The End of the World" in a few days, which I really liked.  For the same reason I read the last book in "The Unutterable" series in a week: "When people read this, they'll understand.  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was such a disappointment   It really should have been a trilogy, but at the same time it is so short   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . A good book. But   it   was   written   by  an   amateur   in  a  way   that   has   become   standard   for   all   of   science   books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this was a wonderful novel but was unable to finish it despite my efforts. The character development seemed a little too superficial and not fully developed enough for me to want to continue the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book    I really enjoyed reading this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written like a book about a long time ago. It is written in the style of an 80's pop movie with great visual effects. The characters are boring and annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a big science fiction fan I like the stories but   I   can't get into them.   The stories don't work as stand alone.   They do some good   science fiction ideas, but 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While   the book is interesting,   it is very long,  and   in addition to   a lot of   boring facts,    it   has   nothing to do   with   the   issue   on which   I have   studied   for   nearly  ten   years .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very difficult book to read.  It has all the hallmarks of a bad author:  it has the same kind of "first sentence" over and over,  it uses the same "story" over a hundred times,  the ending is a total anticlimax,  etc.  I can't tell if it's the writer's fault, or if the editor's:  The end is unsatisfying  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is very hard for me to get through a book that I find so very distasteful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As good as the story was, I found the plot tedious and unoriginal.   I was disappointed because I was looking forward to reading a good book about a good guy with a secret identity (my favourite type of book). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a bad read, but is otherwise an ok read.   It is mostly a chronicle of his work as a military lawyer.  He is a great story teller, but the story is mostly irrelevant because it is a very repetitive case study of what was wrong with the military justice system, and a good deal of the book is devoted to trying to correct it.  I am glad to see that the military is finally going to take an active interest in making justice more impartial.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to try to understand my reaction to a certain episode of "Survivor."  I'm the person who, before the show, thought about how good Russell Hantz was as a player and wondered if there were some elements that made him a good person as well.  The Hantz/Spencer Bledsoe story seemed to fit perfectly in the context of my overall view of the show:  It was an incredible run of a good friend coming across as a little too great.  I felt bad for Spencer because, even as the show was saying all the right things about how great he was, it was a very disappointing turn.   This book is a great example of a "reading" that can do the exact opposite:  I was very interested in the book as an introduction to a good mystery novel.  It has a lot of clues.  But I don't think the book could have done a better job of explaining what was actually going on and just why Spencer's actions were right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book that has been out for months and is still available:  Well, what can I say. I read the book and I'm sorry that I bought it.   I was under the impression that the author was an award winning, respected and highly intelligent author, but apparently he's a mediocre one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so glad I didn't read this book! It took me a long time to realize I wanted to read it, and it just doesn't interest me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very disappointing and poorly written.      It is a poorly written historical narrative which contains no meaningful information about the author's own family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book, but   instead it just   ruins   everything   that it   claims to   be.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad novel.   I read it in its original English form, with an errant introduction and a couple of minor inaccuracies.  The plot is interesting and the descriptions of the various animals' different lives are very well done.  This would have been fine if they had made it about more than a fox, but that doesn't help the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like a lot of the book, but there are a couple that made a deep impression on me. First is "The New York School: The True Story of a City on the Verge of Becoming Too Big to Fail." The authors' thesis is that New York is the capital of the world of finance and the greatest place for people who want to be big business executives to learn how to run big corporations.   It's not bad -- it's just that I wish it were different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is so long and boring, it makes me want to do nothing but sleep.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a terrible book.   It starts out well with a good setup, but as I was reading the characters and events I realized that there was no real connection between the people in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book for the money.   You don't get a lot more bang for your buck than a good good cookbook  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to believe that the author would produce a book that is so worthless.   This book is a failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I have read in a long time.   It is filled with so much unmitigated stupidity that it's hard to understand how anyone could possibly like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when it came out.   It is a very dry book, as you know when you read it.  It's an interesting read, but also a dry read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book and it deserves better reviews than that. The plot of this book is interesting but the ending is not. I found it to be highly unsympathetic toward the protagonist and his sister.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book: The most important thing about books is that they're written by people who know what they're talking about.  I   expected to enjoy the text but   never did,   especially the final chapters.   The   last paragraph   about a father who couldn't get a good night's sleep   seems to be more about the child who's   being parented by   his   father than   he is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no plot, just a bunch of uninteresting characters (especially the female characters).   The plot has some interesting elements:    The people in a group of four boys who take over the house for a summer get to live together for free (they're in high school)   They get to eat good food, get exercise and do chores   Some people are impressed by them, others are not   A guy who can read and write is considered very good    Unfortunately, the book is over within the first few pages 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a shame I couldn't finish this book   This book would be really useful if I ever ran out of things to say about feminists.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is probably the worst book I've ever read by a woman (not that I haven't had a great many).   It has some good parts, but its biggest problem is that her entire style is so self-important and self-confrontational   I feel like she's telling me how to think about a certain issue   (something she does repeatedly).  The only thing she ever brings to the table is a list of books that are great - and I can't help but notice that all of them have at least one book I enjoyed as a kid:  It was a great list.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this was a good book at first, but after a couple of pages I was just going "ew" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I just finished reading a book we've heard a lot about and didn't like very much.   There are plenty of good things in the book, and it does a fine job of showing how the use of the word "sick" has changed over the years, but I found it very misleading when it came to the recent "sicker" use by the health care industry to describe patients, the health of their health, and their "health care."   The reason the term "sickle-cell anemia" had to be invented is that the cell membrane (or "sieve") in a sick person's blood was too permeable for red blood cells to pass through and grow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was one of the worst books I've ever read  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't usually review books because I can't get enough of the authors, but this one did not impress me:    I enjoyed it as a non-fiction read, but I felt that some of its arguments were flawed and that the author failed to make their case very clearly.   It is good for reading a book about a historical period,  but I would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the kind of book that makes you think:  I wish I had thought of that when I was reading it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was bad    My brother picked it up and tried it on, but the sizing just doesn't work for him and he gave up after a couple of days. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book.   The first two thirds of the book is fantastic.  They start out with a very important piece of scientific research and how it relates to a more general concept:  The main theme of this book is that the whole idea of evolution is wrong and the idea that all species are of a common origin is an extremely flawed idea.  While these two ideas might have some overlap, the main focus of the "evolution" of the human race has to be found in the very beginning.  Evolution is really just another word for "change" which has also been used to describe change in other organisms.  The book starts with the idea of the common descent of humans and then goes on to present evidence that shows that this idea is completely flawed and is a theory which is not supported by the actual facts.  This is a well written and detailed book but I feel that the main topic of the whole book is a very bad idea and does not deserve the time and energy that has been invested into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading about a man who is just as angry with the world as I am.   The narrator is very angry, and the language is full of expletives and anger. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    These are good books about a subject that needs to be covered: the psychology of terrorism. They do a good job of introducing the concept and its problems, but their conclusions seem a bit forced.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad.   It is like a bad movie that one watches at work because it was enjoyable.    It had a lot of problems that made it unlistenable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title, which has been changed to "The Last Boy on Earth" from "The Boy Who Fought Monsters," is a bit too on-the-nose for my taste. It's so out-of-place that it makes the rest of the book seem silly.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was a book called  Bully   in the library that I had looked at, but found too   over-emotional to read.   Unfortunately,   Bully is a   terrible   read. It   was a sad story about a    teenage boy   who killed a classmate's   dog because it was mean to   him.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book doesn't stand on its own.   It's just one more in a long line of books written by someone who knows about nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad reviews for "The Giver" is well known, but the good ones are even more so.   This is a great example of the genre:  The Giver is about a young man who grows up to become a huge, clumsy   sociopath.  What makes the story special is that it is not only about a sociopath but a sociopolitical ideology:  the belief that the wealthy should have no obligations to those   who can't afford their   care.  You might call that a sociopathy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has very little in the way of plot. The only character I liked was the bad guy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a big fan of science fiction but I'm so annoyed by this book.   For all the good it does, the book is so badly written   that I'm not sure how much use I can actually make out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is awful. It is also just plain bad. It's so bad that I had to put the book back on my shelf and do a fresh start with a different book: the one I've been reading: http://www.gibsonbooks.com/carl/wedding.html  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy reading this book. It is repetitive and tedious and has a number of weak points in it (for example the hero's desire to become rich in a short time, but then becoming impoverished when his friends become rich). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only redeeming quality I could find in the book was the nice cover art.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible.   It is boring and unoriginal.  Instead of a good story, the author uses two bad stories from a bunch of movies and rewrites the first.  It has no impact on the world and no lasting impact on characters.  The author should have stopped at the second book, instead of starting over with the same boring plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem with this book is that it fails to show how an economy could do without a money-printing-driven monetary system.  The monetary system is the only means to a desirable end  It is the reason the US dollar is so popular in the world   It's the reason why the Euro is such a bad currency
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been reading for a long time and read this as a gift for my father.   The book itself is excellent and well written, but the presentation of the story is just poor and the last few pages (the book ends) just didn't seem to hold up very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bad translation of the original Chinese novel   The translation is a mess   Not worth the money
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was hard to read. The narrator used a very old fashioned, and very boring, way to tell her stories.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to tell exactly what makes this book so bad.   The story is good, but the characters are not so.  They are either too dumb, too dumb and too fat, too fat and too stupid, too stupid and too lazy.  This story is not about how to learn to speak to people.  It's about how one should speak to one's mother, and how this will make you a better person.  If one of these characters did get a degree, one would have to wonder how they got to be in a program to learn how to be a human being in a human system that the authors admit doesn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad ideas, poorly thought out, illogical, and not as good as its title.   I am no longer able to find a good book to read on my Kindle. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about an encounter with a weird alien, but the book is not about that. It's about two men who are attracted to each other but have never had a true relationship.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried reading this book and gave up before   it finished.   This is a good read   but I think there   needs to be more about the people and   why they do things   or if there is anything that could be done  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a terrible book - poorly written, poorly researched and poorly summarized.   The first section is about a recent debate over whether the Christian faith is more a "lifestyle" or a "religion" - i.e., whether it is based on faith alone or if it requires faith in something more.  The author has little to say about this debate, but he does make a few interesting observations about how religion can be (or can become) an ego-based, self-important affair, especially when one is surrounded by non-believers.  Then he goes on to say that when it comes to God, the only real difference between the two is how we experience him.  For those who have read my article about the existence of God, it is nothing less than a declaration that it's impossible to have any relationship with him. For those for whom he does exist, the book is more like a sermon about the folly of our faith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to get this book for my friend, but when he showed me the synopsis I was dismayed.   The characters and their actions don't mesh together.  I liked the characters in the book but not when the author tries to tell us something about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure what's worse about this book - the fact that it's about a young woman who's a virgin and who is not a virgin, or the fact of the book's poor writing  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is poor.   I liked that the book was so close to the movie but was so much better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    These were just a bunch of self-important fools trying to cash in on the popularity of their own book ( The Selfish Gene ).   They failed and, at least in my case, got themselves killed by the resulting publicity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing I can say about this book is that it's a good read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an incredibly poorly written book about a very well-known author, which can be best described as a poorly written biography. The writing style of the book is extremely poor, and the whole book is really just a series of anecdotes about the author and his work, which I found kind of disheartening.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a very good book that is hard to get into, and hard to understand.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... If you don't like the cover art, forget it.   -   A book about a girl's sexual experiences at a university. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a disappointing, dull, boring read. I can't believe I read this book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sure the idea of reading something that you don't like is a good one:  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the book at all.   It's full of the same type of clichés that most non-fiction novels have, like "The rich have more fun than the poor"   In the end, it's just another in a long line of books where the author wants to give a "feel-good" message, but doesn't quite do it (or at least doesn't try very hard)  I would rather read a book about a real world problem  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a complete waste of time, I spent more time on it than reading the book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst thing about this book is the author.   When I was a teenager I tried to be a good, honest person, but that didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is NOT the bible!   Instead it's a nice book about how you can become a good person without having to read The Bible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of the book is a lot of stuff about history that is extremely boring.   (I'm still trying to get my head around why people believed Napoleon died when he really didn't )    This is followed by a bunch of boring stuff about how bad religion is, and then some boring stuff that is about the history of religion as a whole. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been a fan of the   Dune   books    for years now, but they've   been getting a lot of bad reviews lately.   Well, it's the worst Dune book   ever.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A mediocre book from an amateur.   The stories were mostly interesting but the characters were shallow.  The author wrote about himself from the beginning of his life (which is odd), but he doesn't show any real insight into his life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For whatever reason, I didn't enjoy this book.   This is not a bad short story, but rather a poor book in general. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did enjoy reading this book, as I usually do when I get a good one.   In a good way, the author describes his childhood in great detail.  He doesn't sugarcoat it.  His parents (his mother was a successful doctor) were not the best or the brightest people.  When they were trying to cure him of being a good-for-nothing loser (he was) they went after him and beat him up a bit.  They were probably justified in doing so.  Also, his father was a really stupid, selfish, abusive jerk.  It is not clear to me why he wasn't thrown out of the house when he turned sixteen (it's possible that he had other things on his mind than the kids).   Although he has never been a good student, he does seem to have a talent for languages (and reading).  He's so smart that he actually thinks he's the smartest person in the room.  This is one of those "it's a good book about a good person" kind of stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased "The Red and the Black" after reading about it in a magazine article.   My only real problem with the book was the lack of any information on the subject of "the race card".   It seems that the author of the article didn't bother to research it at all, and when they did find it they just assumed it was true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried reading this book a couple of times but couldn't put it down.   The only reason I gave this book two stars is that it takes forever to get from chapter to chapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is poorly written and written in a way that will only irritate the reader. It was so frustrating to read this book that I actually stopped reading it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with so many inaccuracies I am stunned. The facts are not even correct. The map in this book is NOT a map of a county, but of the state. The county is known as "the county of the big lakes" NOT "the County of the Big Lakes".   My only complaint about this book: he has too much information about the state of Ohio to do his research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't read this book, but my friend and I listened to it while he was on a trip. I didn?t enjoy it very much, so I will pass it on.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been looking for a good mystery novel for a long time.   The reason I have been looking is the wonderful covers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I could only pick one book from this wonderful year for   my book collection (I have about fifty), it would   be   this one.   I   read   it   twice   before I gave up on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the first of a couple of books by a guy who believes he's been duped by something like a computer or a mind implant, and it's so full of wrongheadedness and stupidity and pseudo-science that it's a disappointment.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a fan of science fiction and fantasy I really appreciated this book, but as a writer I found it very disappointing. The "hero" of the book is a very nice person and I like that he gets some sympathy but that he is portrayed as someone who doesn't think about the consequences of his actions:  A good example of a book that could have done with more editing.   The character has to overcome many bad habits: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading the entire novel, I found that the character development was all a little too easy. For example, the protagonist is constantly looking for a girlfriend, but when she does come along, she immediately dumps him.   It was almost like the author had a mental episode and thought that he wanted to write a romance novel, but decided not to go to graduate school for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I'd gone into this book with more interest than just a casual skim-read (to avoid spoilers).   This is not a bad story in a bad way, but the story itself feels like a plot-twist for a television series:  It is really bad, but there is a really fun twist at the end that makes the story interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this is one of those books that is just so terrible.   In fact,   as you read the book   you   come to believe that   the author   must be a   moron   who has   done his research very   badly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I've ever read.    It's all about how stupid some people are   Who cares what people think of you when you can't get laid?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author had some ideas about the need for a global consciousness, but his ideas are so self-centered that he can't think of a single example that supports it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I read that there was going to be a new  book   from her (or a new author I thought) that I wanted to try but couldn't wait.   But when I opened the book I noticed that her first book was published many years before the new one was, so the new book was just rehashing the same old thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm very disappointed with this book.  It's too preachy (I get tired of this),  too much about religion (what does that have to do with what I did in my life?),  and is riddled with logical inconsistencies   That's a big problem.   The book was written to help kids understand the nature of the mind:  "You see, to be human is to see the real world as it really is. You know, all the things that the Bible says are true—that God created everything, that we're all part of one big family,    And so, the question is: Is the world that you can see and touch and taste and smell the real nature of existence?   If so, then why don't we see and taste   and smell   the real essence of existence  ?  "   But, this isn't true:  The universe is not a physical place, but is, in fact, an idea.  You know what the best way to think about this is?  You can't see the world as being physically real   - it's an idea   that has to be realized:  You are in the mind of a single person:  He knows it's just his mind, but it's real:    Because it's you.  (And that's why you know, intellectually, what you know in your heart, because it's him.)   You do the same thing with a computer:  So you have to program it into thinking like a mind.  Then you can use it in any way you want:  Do anything.  Use a computer.  Run a car. ...  And this is the way things work in your mind.   But that's only possible because it has that concept in it.  And your brain does not have that concept.  So, if you think you're a mind that has that in it, that's what you're.  "

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book with hopes of having a good read.   The characters were bland and one dimensional.  They all seemed to be at odds with each other.  I am trying to think of a book  where  I've  been happier with a protagonist.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a man who lived through the Depression and was an author of numerous well written books and articles about the Depression, which included one called The Depression and My Depression.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was interested in the idea of a male writer who is self-deprecating about his work.   However, the author failed to provide any depth or depth in the story he created.  I felt like there was a hole   but then   the author gave up   and left the readers with a  hollow story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a teenager, I was often given an expensive book from my school library.   I never finished reading it, but it was very expensive and I felt compelled to read it to pass the time before the school year ended.  The book was about a poor man who had the means and the will to escape the world, but who instead went mad.  It was a sad story, but the protagonist made an attempt to survive it, and that is what is important to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a big fan of David Foster Wallace   and I've been trying to read everything he's ever written  .   If it hadn't been for the fact that the book I wanted to read wasn't available, I'd   have been disappointed  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a book about mental illness, but it's a book on how hard it is to understand and talk about.   I don't think mental illness is an illness that the average person can understand.  It's more like a disease, a disorder  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part is that the book contains several important scientific discoveries that make the old theories on the topic obsolete. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited about this book.  It was one of the last works of John Cheever  before his tragic untimely death.   He always left me wanting more  but not wanting to read all of his work.  This book had a good plot but no character development.  The characters were not compelling or well developed   It also took me a long time to get through the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written in a way that is like a bad movie.  It's   boring,   pretentious,  and full of   cliches.   It   makes you feel   like a fool for   buying a book   that   doesn't live up to   its   hype. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, a former professor of literature, is very clever in making people believe what they want to believe, especially if their political beliefs are based on misinformation.  I just had a very uncomfortable discussion with someone who was trying to rationalize his hatred of immigrants by saying that a lot of them are lazy and take drugs and are not as hard-working as he is.    A friend of mine told me she tried to explain that the author had not read the book and that it was not based on any facts.  She tried to persuade me that the fact that she had no job in the middle of the book was not enough to make a claim about its accuracy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The reason I gave this book 4 stars is because   it   was   written   in a   condescending   style  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy this book, but in many ways it was very good.   It was good as a book,   it was good  as a study  and  as   a presentation of   my own opinions on   the issues   (e.g.,   if I had not gone to that church,  then   things might have been different   in my marriage    and my future choices in life would be different ).   Unfortunately, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the most expensive book I have ever read on a subject that I have little knowledge about.   I think my ignorance is why I wanted to read the book.  I thought it would explain a subject I am interested in more clearly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed the book, but it really felt like a labor of love to me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written.   It is a poorly organized text that lacks research and the author's judgment.  It seems as if the author was given the book and simply read it, without checking its contents and making sure that it is accurate and balanced. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was just awful!   It's so bad that I don't even want to discuss the plot at all.   I felt like it was just sooo bad and so  bad   that I wouldn't want to read   anything   about   the movie  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very interesting book that tries to provide some good evidence for the claim that the religious right has done a lot of good but a lot to much harm for the cause of Christian theocracy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts with a great plot idea and then goes off the rails.   It's an interesting premise,   but once the main character realizes he's being manipulated   by the villain he becomes an empty shell who doesn't say a word.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, by one of the most influential American scholars of the early 20th century, is a poor translation of the original Russian.   This is a very poor translation.  It has a lot in common with many of the "new" translations I've read in the last decade or so.  I had to reread a lot of this book in the past year, and I think it's a pretty poor translation, even by the standards of good American scholars (I think it would be a lot easier to translate this book if they'd use the word   "tears" to indicate tears), but   It's all right if it can't be bothered to get the correct Russian translation,  but  I found it quite disappointing  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have tried reading a great many of these books before, but this one is the one that kept bugging me.   So many people's lives had been ruined by people who lied, who cheated, who stole... and the ones who were so lucky as to keep it quiet...   It's amazing how many people have to suffer through that misery for their children.

Write a negative review about a bad book:      A bad book!   The first 100 pages or so of the book are very good.   But after that the author wastes a lot of time on a lengthy prologue that tries to justify what he's done and is about to do in this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first attempt at reading the book I had to go to my mother's to borrow a copy:  I was disappointed in how poorly the book came out.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know how I didn't realize how much I really wanted to like this book by now.   The first paragraph in the book says:  "The first thing you do when you see a young girl is laugh at her. She has a kind of magic about her that you feel even if you don't understand her."   Is that what a magical girl feels?   This book is full of magic, but not of love.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters in this book are just plain terrible. I found myself trying hard to imagine what would make someone so utterly and completely miserable that they were willing to go to so many lengths to get what they want.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a very poor book.   The main character is a really awful person.  The author is using this character as a way to make a political point about the poor and to paint the poor as undeserving of assistance.  I don't get why       She can't see that if these people are so poor that they have to get the aid of government programs that help the rich,  that means   they are also undeserving   of such assistance.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first heard about The Black Tapes I thought that it would be a great book about a man, but was sadly disappointed:  What the author does not tell the reader is that there is little evidence that anything that has happened to him in the past is real   It is a long book and while the descriptions are good the descriptions do not match the real  The author seems to know the true name of the murderer and has given a great deal of information about the case but he doesn't mention that the real name is the same as the one he has given to the media.   He also mentions a dead man who might have committed the murder and he gives the real evidence for that but fails to tell the readers the real murderer's name  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the things I love about this is the way it makes the reader forget all about all those other books that made the rounds in grade school.   It's one thing to try a "discover-your-roots" approach to reading, but it's quite another to make that "discovery" turn into a huge pile of crap.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most annoying thing about this book is the narrator.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know what to think about this book: On the one hand, the title is perfect: it is the story of a young American woman who tries to escape from the grip of an abusive ex-lover. On the other hand, I could not get past the title: "A good read about an awful story." It's an odd title.   It was certainly an enjoyable read, but what I really want is for someone to go back and try to tell the story from the man's point of view, and make it about the woman's own situation, which is even worse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part is that the book has no actual value to most readers who are not interested in occult/paranormal matters.   This book is a collection of nonsense, written by a "scientist" for "scientists"

I thought it would be a story of love and loyalty between a man and his dog. But this is too bad, because it is not a good story,  it is a sad,  superficial,  and  shallow  piece of literature .  I will not read a book that is about a man's love for a dog 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are a sci-fi fan then you might be surprised by this book's lack of interest in the genre. It has been around for decades, with a few different authors in charge, but it has never produced anything that has held my attention. It's just not entertaining.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading a whole lot of books that failed miserably in writing, I am disappointed by what I have read in this one.   The main character is a complete and total idiot.  He is the type of person who is constantly making excuses for people in bad things and then saying he did it on purpose because it's "better" to lie to the people in power.  She is the kind of person that is always the "right" one.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have only read one of Michael Whelan's works: The Art of Being a Family.   He was the co-author of this book with his wife.  It is based on their personal experience in raising four boys.  They were wonderful.  The boys grew up to be fine, happy men.  Whelon seems to write about them as though they were a perfect family.  I believe that the boys are happier when they are together than apart.  Unfortunately, there are some bad things that the book mentions.  One of them is a bad habit of his brother which caused them to stay up late playing video games.  My sons are now the same age as the Whelans.  If that bad habit doesn't go away,  I am going to try to do something about it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a real disappointment for me.   It's not just that it's a poor attempt at science fiction -- this is a story about a world of asexuals where a lot of people don't get enough pleasure out of sex -- but also that it just makes no sense at all.  As a reader I really did expect the story to be about asexuality but I really was waiting for some kind of explanation about the fact that there are no "natural" sexual responses in this world (although they don't have to be either -- there are a number of "abnormal" sexual organs that might be considered "natural").   But no explanation is needed -- they aren't natural -- there's no reason at all for there to be one (or one other) sexual response for most people.  I guess I wanted to hear some explanation why the characters didn't just find a solution to their problem -- and why the author never thought about the subject himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an excellent book, but the author does a terrible job of telling it. The first half of the book is a collection of short stories, and the second half is about her own personal experiences of having a stroke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book is nothing but a series of self-help techniques to help people "get rid of their bad habits".   I just found this all over the web and found it to be really disappointing.   First, the book talks about the importance of being in the present moment.  That means doing something that you have to do in order to be free.  Then it gives up on that and says that people should just follow their natural instincts and habits.  Even though it does talk about it,  it never really explains what natural instincts are.  Next it says that a good book that has "the right advice" would "have a happy ending" because it shows that there is a way out of these "bad habits". This is true for some people.  For others it will end up being a bad habit.  There is no way that a book about "getting rid of bad habits" will help someone to get rid of one of their "bad" ones.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read The Art of Fielding: A Short History and it is a sad book.   The author describes a lot of interesting things, but the book's flaws are numerous.  It starts out with a lot (although, I think it's misleading) about how there's a lot more information about the game of golf and golf clubs in the book than what you learn in the game.  For instance, the golf clubs are described as:  " a golf club is like a gun that can be fired from a distance   (no real evidence that this is true)   A golf club can be used for a number of tasks   This includes, but is not limited to, throwing, holding a gun, hunting, hunting animals, hitting targets, playing in a frat house, drinking with friends and other things."  Then, the author describes his own first time using a golf clubs, which is also described as a gun:  It was something I had never seen before: a golf tee.  The tee is attached to a set of straps and is wrapped in a cloth. The club is held at chest level with the strap that connects it to the tee. It's made from an elastic material that allows the club to bend and flex with the natural movements of a golfer   So, I'd have to think that the club is at least in the ballpark of a handgun.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I was a little bored one day and found the idea for this book very interesting.   It's about a man who writes a memoir about his life from the age of ten to the age at which he began writing.  His family has problems that were brought about by an extremely nasty woman who is a member of the family.  (I don't really like this woman but I think that the book could have been made better without her; it's really too bad she wasn't included.)    Overall, it's a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad read:  The narrative is full of contradictions.  The author claims to have been one of the original founders of the New World Order and to have helped to create the Federal Reserve.  But he makes a mess of all these alleged facts.  It's one thing to claim that the Illuminati created the Federal reserve.  If that is true, it's certainly reasonable to believe that he would have been among those that actually created it.  Of course, the Illuminati would not be so sloppy and incompetent as to have the Federal bank fail.  In the event that it were to be set up properly, it would be just another of the many "too big to fail" institutions that the Federal government has created.  What a shame for someone who would be able to give the Illuminati a good name.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book.   For the most part, I liked the story, but the characters were so cliched and stereotypical.  A guy dies.  Then,  He gets back.  You might think that, by this point, the book would at least get interesting and make you care about the characters, but it does nothing of the sort.  They don't develop or change in the least.  I hate the fact that I kept waiting for someone to come along and save the day, but this book failed to do so.

The problem is that the ideas that the book attempts to convey seem rather strange to me.  It's like you are trying to teach a computer the concepts of logic, and you find yourself talking about "free will" and "obligations" and such.  I understand that you are just trying to make the concepts more familiar, but I find it a little strange that you were trying to say that free will is not a part of our biology. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is no suspense or tension in this novel, no sense of a human struggle to live and survive. The characters do not have any depth or personality, and the plot is uneventful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been waiting for the fourth book in the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher for years, and while I'm not sure I would be interested in following in the footsteps of my favorite hero/antihero of all time, the fourth volume is a nice addition to the series.   The book does not quite live up to the first two, but Butcher is a very talented author and he has made the series more entertaining than it was before. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is full of inaccuracies, the book is not worth the money and   the book   is not well written.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate to say that this book is one of the worst  I've read in a long time   but it's one of those   that makes you realize that you really should not have  read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I finished reading, I felt as if I was a completely different person.   For about a year, I couldn't get myself to read any books; I was always having panic attacks about the end of my life.  I finally gave up trying and decided to read just one:  It really turned me off to modern literature.  Not a good book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this as part of a series (The Rise and Fall of the Berlin Wall) on the fall of the wall.   The first book is good.  The last two books are poor.  I had heard good things about the first book and read it in the library.  They were great - I loved it.  For this series I am hoping for more of the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was very bad for a number of reasons:  First, it was written by a psychologist.   He was hired by a small company to conduct a study of how people perceive positive and negative statements in the media.  It was a rather poor study:  The problem was that the "positive" statements were frequently just like a commercial;  (e.g.  "...if you don't mind the price...")  And the "negative" statements did not always come from a commercial.  ( e.g:  "It is better to be a success than a failure!"  )   Second, it uses the standard "emotional manipulation" to get its point across.  This is something that the authors of  books  have been criticized for:  They are trying to get a "positive psychological response" from the reader, but they don't necessarily get that.  When I wrote  about this problem, I said:  If you want to manipulate someone's emotions, you can use the same techniques as a psychologist:  Tell them you are testing whether a drug is going to make them better at something.  Tell someone you have been reading about a miracle cure that the person has used before.  In the same way that the  Drug company   might tell their  patients   that their treatment is going well and that they will be getting new customers if they continue using the treatment, the Psychologist  would tell a client that they are "better" at something than they really are.  I guess you could say that these are just psychological  means of "selling" a drug.  Third, the "psychologists" were so over-confident that they would have a positive psychological effect on their client's behaviors that they often got it wrong.  Fourth, the authors don't seem to consider  things that might be important to their client  (like the possibility that their client might simply be "confused" about what they were told)  fifth, the book is very negative.  Sixth, and perhaps most importantly, the information provided is so dated that many people (especially those with a low sense of irony) would be tempted to conclude that these psychologists   are just trying to sell their books to people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me months to finish this book.   I have been searching the Internet for years, but have found nothing that is even remotely close to what I've found on this website.   This is the "real" story behind why I have had an aversion to the term "Celtic" since I was a child and this book, along with the rest of the British   "Celts"   series, is a reminder that "Celia"  was no "Cute little Celts,"   which it had a habit of being called. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is written by a person who knows nothing about the subject and has no expertise.   I had a hard time finding out anything new about the topic and the book was full of misleading information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was interesting enough, but I'm glad I turned the book down.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think that this is a very good book.   It is certainly not the best book to read when you don't want to think about things in detail, but it is the best I can find that deals with the same issue in a straightforward manner.  It's very depressing, but also very human. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is great, but the ending doesn't work.    This book is so much better than the others I've read - but the "final" chapter just feels wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the first book I ever bought on Kindle and I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm sure I'll be buying more books from Kobo soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I was enjoying this novel, I also felt there was some very poor writing choices. I was under the impression that we had only seen glimpses of the characters from the story, but once the main characters appeared, we were given full descriptions.   This is a book written to teach.  To a great extent, it succeeds in that endeavor, but I feel that some of the most effective teaching takes the form of a very long monologue delivered by the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a pretty good book about the early years of the American labor movement, from its founding by the Knights of Labor in 1887 until its defeat in the early 1920s.   There are some good anecdotes and some interesting details about the various organizations and unions and their leaders, but the overall tone is that the workers were the "invisible" people of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does not have a lot going for it.   It seems to have a major design flaw in that the author, by trying to include everything in the story, leaves out a major chunk. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't remember the title of this book but it was about a family.   My mother was a great mother. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought I would be impressed with this book, but I was not.   The book is supposed to give us a good idea about how we can increase our level of fitness and stay healthy.  I found it very hard to understand what the author meant when he says "   This book may be great for those who exercise regularly, but the information does not apply to me and most of the other people I know who exercise very infrequently  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book much at all.   There are three different ways in which the book could have been better:  I think the most important reason that this book could not be good is that the author does not really tell us anything about the culture in which she lived.  I don't think that a good writer would have bothered to find out, because in her books the culture is mostly invisible.  The book is supposed to be about the experience of the people in the book (including a family member of hers), but I was able to guess all of the things that I heard and felt from the culture without ever having read a word about it in the primary sources.  This is one of those books that is really good in parts and very bad in others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book about children's book authors is a poor substitute for the original: a good book should teach a child to read.   This book, however, is bad on so many levels:  -   The first half of the book is about a child, a little boy named Paul, who has lost his memory and becomes a "stupid idiot" when he reads a book that he is about to write.  -   The second half of this book has the child, "Nancy," rereading the book (with her children, in this case) until she has the complete series:  This is another book about the importance of reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been reading a great book about the civil rights era   but after reading the first few chapters, the book just doesn't hold up.   This book's not bad per se but it's not that great either,   it's just not as good as the other two books that have been written about the same time period. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for a college course on women's literature that I am taking.   Unfortunately, it is a poor representation of both women and women's interests.    The first chapter is a very long, pointless essay on   "the   value of the   woman's body."    It starts with a review of the work of Andrea Dworkin, which is interesting in that she has been critiqued very highly by many feminists.  The rest of the book is about   what she actually wrote, which was not all that different  from the work that other feminist writers have critiquied. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a pretty good book about the first days of college. I read a little bit about her, about her father and her own past, but I wanted to read about the world in which she found herself.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting more from this book than what I got.   It was pretty good at making me laugh.  However, the ending of the book was very unsatisfactory.  I felt like this was some sort of punishment for what happened to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very well-written book about a good girl trying to learn how to become a good guy. It is also a very good book about the way we are all treated.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book after the       "Practical Guide to Self-Respect"  .   It is a bad   book   because   it   encourages   negative   feelings about your spouse.   As a wife  ,  I   can  t   enjoy   a   marital   relationship   with   my   husband   when   we   are   in   an   unhealthy   one   We   each   must   accept   all   the  feelings   and   limitations   that   come   from   marriage  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I enjoyed this book as a reader, there are two things I think I should have paid attention to.   1) I wish the book had given more details about the history behind the creation of the United Nations and its predecessor, the League of Nations.  2) I don't know who the real "bad guys" are in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and was so angry that my book was not a best-seller.   It was an   terrible   book that   tried   to be   smart   about   Islam.    There were no   good   reasons   for   it   this   so   she   wanted to   convince   us   that

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seems that the writer had forgotten or had not bothered to research the history of the war and the soldiers involved.   This book seems to be just an excuse for people to feel good about themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't understand what is the point of reading about a person who has an affair?   The way they describe the affair is ridiculous.   They are always saying "I would have done it all over again"   Which is like a person saying they would have gone to the prom if they had known it was coming.  I wish they would go back to the first book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this to be the least fun I've ever had reading a book in my life.   It's a collection of short stories that basically all revolve around a character who's going to die soon, and the stories take up the whole book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has been three months since I finished this book and I am still unable to get past the initial discomfort with its language.   The first time I tried to read through the book was with no success.  It is a very, very bad book and very badly written.  I've seen a few reviews stating that the book is about the rise of the Christian faith and the eventual rejection thereof, and while this is one aspect of it, it is not the sole cause.  Also, if one of the primary purposes of this book is to show that Islam is wrong about what it teaches, why is that the only point it is making?  And, just why did the authors of the book go out of their way to include a large amount of information that supports Islam?   (I realize that is my reading comprehension and that the information could be interpreted many different ways, but it seems to be a lot to ask for.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a man who believes that his wife should be the primary parent of their 5 children, including a son in a wheelchair.   I would not recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is so confusing that I could not figure out how I could ever do the job.   I've been in the IT field and I've never used an external USB flash drive for anything.  I had to order the flash drive online and I ended up purchasing one from Best Buy that I'm unsure if I'll ever use. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think I've ever finished a book as bad as this. I couldn't finish the book because my wife didn't like the book's "adult-like" language, and then the second book in the series ended on a bad note.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second book I have had to read from the author in a very short time.   The first was a non-fiction history, about the fall of the Berlin Wall, in which the author wrote in a highly negative manner about the Russian invasion of the Baltics in 1989    There is a certain irony that the author of this book, who seems to have written as a soldier   of the Warsaw Uprising   would like to be remembered 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book had all the elements of a classic tale of deception and betrayal: the betrayer being a noble character; the betrayed being a foolish fool; the betrayal being the cause of the betrayor's downfall; the villain being evil but misguided; the hero getting the best of it in the end; and the story being a tale of redemption for the hero, a true hero.   However, while the hero is redeemed, the villain is never, never redeemed.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so long that I felt bad about going back to it at the end.   A good book should tell a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an interesting work, but not nearly as interesting as some other books on the subject.   For example:  The author believes that he is being attacked by the government because he's been a strong advocate of the Second Amendment and has made his opposition to the "assault weapons" ban an issue.  As he points out, he's not being attacked because he has a lot of money, or because he speaks well, or that he's a smart guy.  Instead, he says, the attacks on him are because he "is not a member of the liberal clique" or because "his views are too close to those of his father."   The last statement is especially telling, because his father's views (he's a fan of Rand Paul) are exactly the opposite of the positions advocated by Paul's mother, who is a strong supporter of gun control and is a liberal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a good book on the topic of sexual education for women.   However, the writing is not good, and the subject matter is uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time.   My high school friend had a hard time reading it,   because it just seemed so dry    she said that she wanted to have a conversation about   it, but that it's too bad that the subject wasn't explored at length. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was intrigued by this book because it promised to expose "the inner workings of America's first national oil company".   Well, it didn't.   It's a well researched book but it doesn't give a true understanding of how it worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to get a copy of   The Last Werewolf.   A lot of people really enjoyed   the   book   But   it   just   didn't   add anything   That's   disappointing  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so very disappointed in this book.   It's very difficult to understand the motivation of the authors who write about their own religious experiences.  It comes off as superficial, which is not good.  They have very little insight into what goes on within a mind.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very bad book.   It's the first book I've ever given to anyone and I was disappointed at the level of quality (in both the text and the presentation)   The cover is atrocious and the text is completely incomprehensible and the format is poor       I'm embarrassed to say I put it down as soon as I got it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is excellent and the subject is interesting.   This is more of a novel than a non-fiction book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I started reading this book, I was hoping to find a good, balanced look at the "fringe" of the world, like in the Harry Potter series or the Hunger Games.   But, as I was reading it, I started to realize that it was going to be one more story about a guy trying to be someone he's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so disappointing that it has led to some of the most terrible conversations with my husband and myself ever:  My husband, who has a reputation for being an avid reader, asked me to read this book: "What the hell is it about?" I explained that it is about a woman who has been married to a man for 30 years.  I was stunned, because I thought that marriage would be such a good thing:  He was, after all, a good husband;  He had a wife he loved;  She had kids, which made life more fulfilling;   He could always see me whenever he wanted to, which seemed nice;  But now, 30 years later, he seemed like a stranger.   I'm pretty sure I'm one of those "Why didn't they just go out for coffee" sort of couples. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about reading a book about the French Revolution, but I didn't realize that all of the information and analysis in the book was not from the first-hand accounts of survivors. The only thing that was interesting was the mention of one of the authors, Georges Duby, who wrote a popular history about the revolution.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While this is about a woman's husband cheating on her, I can't think of a more insensitive or offensive thing he could have said.   The only reason he's not in prison or on death row is because he killed the dog. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't enjoy this book.   It's a well-known thing that fantasy authors often have trouble putting together plots that make sense.  One thing they often have that authors who write in genres other than fantasy don't is a good understanding of historical/realistic things.  This book was about a woman who goes into her old sister's house for the weekend and discovers that it is haunted by a powerful vampire.  She and her friends must fight the monster while fighting the effects of aging.  The book wasn't terribly interesting but I did enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my humble opinion,   The   greatest   of the   series, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really, really wanted to love this book.   It has been over a decade since I've read a book that was so beautifully written and so perfect.  It seems so very old-fashioned, but that's because it is.  The characters are all so well-drawn and lovable, that one would hope that if I had any interest in the paranormal, that I'd get involved.  Unfortunately, the book is full of holes and just doesn't have the energy or mystery to keep me engaged.  I'm afraid that the author probably just had a lot to live up to in the 90's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me two days to finish reading   This was my second book from this author   I will definitely continue to support her but this one was   way too long for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book, and I can't get over the fact that the author is so clueless about science and such a poor example of a science major that he could never get a job at a university.   He's so ignorant about the entire subject of science and biology, that he couldn't even find a decent biology textbook.  I'm pretty sure this book is just a poorly-written attempt at promoting a pet theory about evolution, but the book is so bad that it's entertaining.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, in its most essential and necessary form, is a primer on the fundamentals of the law.   It's a very good primer,   but I will   never buy a law book from a publisher again    I have the law books of two other law schools in my law library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't usually give five stars out of five but i have to do so in this case.   The two main characters are bad,   the plot is dumb,    the characters are dumb,   the story is stupid    but it all works together to make a bad story a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I wanted a good introduction to the writings of the late Richard Dawkins.   It didn't deliver on any of its promises.  It's a very poor introduction to Dawkins. The most that I can find to suggest that Dawkins might be a useful book for a beginning student of theism is:  Dawkins has argued that the world's population growth has made humanity more intelligent, better equipped, more peaceful, and more morally complex than ever before.  I can't agree with Dawkins. There are many more obvious explanations for the growth of human numbers than these.  The biggest of these is: The world's populations are in a terrible state of technological backwardness.  To read this chapter is to get a very bad taste in your mouth:  There is a certain amount of moral certainty that has been built up over the course of human history.  Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Christian conviction that the moral law of love is the only legitimate law:  People can only be saved by the act of love, which requires faith in an infinite Being, and which ultimately depends on a belief in a personal God.  In other words, if the whole of humankind can only hope to be saved if God is saved, the rest of humankind is doomed.  Dawkins makes it sound like the Bible and Christian theism are the only acceptable alternatives.  But the problem with the Christian belief is that it's not true.  If God isn't actually a personal being, then how can love make people save themselves?  In short, the Bible is full of contradictions.  (If it is a contradiction to say that the human race is doomed because of its technological backwardess, then it is equally true that the only way that human beings could ever become God is to stop being human.)  The main point that Dawkins makes is that the most advanced civilizations on the planet (for example, the ancient Hebrews) believed in God. I find this point difficult to follow, since I think that there is a good case to be made that the ancient Israelites might have been the most sophisticated people to ever exist.  However, one has to wonder why a civilization as advanced as ancient Israelite society would not have at least been aware of the existence of the divine.  What is worse is that in the introduction to this book Dawkins attempts to show that ancient Israel, which he thinks was the most technologically advanced society on Earth at that time, was actually

Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a while I was looking for a book on this topic. I thought I would find something about a case involving a murderer. I did not. I have to think that the book could have been more helpful to the reader, as there are many places in the book that the author has to admit is misleading, especially in how he describes what the victim actually said at the trial. I read the book, though. It was not worth the price.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I saw "The Emperor's New Clothes" in the back of a library book, I was a little excited to see it.   A great little fantasy.  I thought there was a lot of good in the story, but as the story went on it became quite repetitive and boring.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to get an update on my dog.   He hasn't eaten in weeks and is in a severe shock.  I've found a new and less expensive dog food and she isn't going to get through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a great book until a section about the war with the Japanese in the Pacific became a disaster.     They had been going to Japan and the Philippines for a few weeks at a time to take part in this war since World War I.  To start, the Japanese were not nearly as advanced as the US.  By the time the US and Britain entered the war, the US had won most of the land they had entered.  The Japanese had been at war for a long time and were no match for the US technologically.  It was only when Japan began to develop a new aircraft and weapon system called a kamikaze that the Americans got any better.  I thought they would have been better off staying in the war and using their advantage to make progress in other areas.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high expectations when I received a copy of "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" in the mail.   Although I had enjoyed many of the books on the "How To Organize" series,   this was definitely the least helpful and the most boring I had ever encountered.  When I looked through my closets for anything related to tidying up,  my first thought was "How do I ever go back to the way my closet looks now?"    It's not that I don't want to keep things clean and organized,  but I'm not the sort of person who needs to go through the effort of organizing each item on a shelf or every drawer to make things neat.  It took some effort to learn the basics of organized storage (in particular how to put things into neat piles) but once I did it was relatively easy.  After about 3 days,  I   didn't feel any need to organize anymore.  My entire closet is now just piles of clothes and clothes hangers  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not what I expected out of a nonfiction book: a straightforward, fact-based discussion about the problems of a drug.   It does not say why drugs are bad, it does not even say why they are dangerous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not even sure I agree with this one.   It's got a lot going for it - it's a great read, full of great ideas and it's got that little extra something to make it extra good.  I get the sense that the author was trying to write a very strong thesis about the nature of life and why people make choices in such an impulsive way - and so, in an attempt to explain why people act the way they do, he just makes up a bunch of bad habits and clichés.  Unfortunately, he gets caught in this trap as well - the book tries to explain, but really doesn't want to  make an impact.

It describes a series of events that occurred within the confines of a group of individuals, but   does not provide sufficient details to allow a reader to properly appreciate the   events   The information is also very fragmented and seems to be poorly organized. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the worst thing about this book was the terrible story.   It would have made a lot more sense if this was a work of history and not fiction.  I don't even remember the main character and all he had to do was get rid of his past and become a better person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to get a copy of this.   It seems like a good concept and the book is really good at pulling it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book about life.   It   fails on this front.  The story   goes about as   it   can   without actually being about   life. What   would have made the   story more   realistic is if we   had   met. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book, I think that a great deal of the'magic' that the authors attribute to their magic words was actually a combination of good old fashioned sleight of hand and simple bad writing.   They really can't hide the fact that they can't spell.  It's sad that their spell is so hard to cast that it takes a great amount of effort to accomplish.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A pretty good book that has been overlooked for decades.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book.   There are things I like about it:  the "realness" in her descriptions   the fact that the main characters   are almost identical     it's a book that actually has some character development   but   i'm still not sure   that's really what this book is about  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    These were very bad.   They are not a good substitute for the books I actually used in college (but which were really bad).   I wish I could remember where they came from, but they are very difficult to use when you're writing about actual books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like most of the paranormal stuff in this book. The ghost hunting part is a bad joke.   And the whole "he was killed by a ghost" thing is just a cheap ploy for the paranormal-fan fiction in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book to try and see if there was more to the world than a bunch of religious fanatics.   It was just as boring as I expected it to be

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit that this book is extremely disappointing.   It tries to make us feel bad about our use of social media, yet it also makes it seem like we are making a huge mistake when we use Facebook.  If anyone who uses Facebook would do it differently, that would be a great place to start. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not excited at all for this book.   The first paragraph   states:  "I used to think the world was round but now I think it's flat.  "    It's an interesting thought, but the real problem with this book   is not the thought but   that the author doesn't   make it clear what he's really   thinking. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really like this book but can't make myself read it.   It doesn't have any suspense, no emotional depth, nothing that makes me want to keep reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is basically about why no one wants to learn about history anymore (in case it's anything good).   It's about how it's the last of a dying breed, because the new millennium has seen history get worse and worse with time - not just about the bad guys, but about people and institutions and culture too.   I thought that when I read the book that a few people I'd read a lot of history and know about history thought the book was a lot worse,   but I never did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've always thought the books on this list were interesting and informative, but I was disappointed in this one. It has been described as "the first book on the history of psychiatry" but I found it to be a fairly dry, factual account.   The author makes much of the work of the pioneers, the pioneers who set up a research institute at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the work which went into figuring out why these people were doing the things they did.     But I think it's obvious that what led to the rise of psychiatry in the 1940s and 50s was primarily due to the efforts of these pioneers.  I've always found these kinds of books to be very good, but this one is too technical for my taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a good story from a bad and unimaginative book.   This is one of the most uninspired and mediocre books    that I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for fun, but when I got to the part about how the "good guys" got their asses kicked in the first fight, I felt like I was the only one who wasn't entertained.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping for a good one.   The story itself is not the best.  A very boring, one dimensional, unemotional story.  If this is what the author of the story does for an easy paycheck, I don't want a hard day's work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        If I were a book reviewer, I would rate this book a three-star rating.   The main character is not so much a character, as a cardboard cutout, the "main" plot is an uninteresting non-sequitur and the characters are cliched. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of the Harry Potter series, and I was never very interested in books about witches and wizards. But this is a waste of money and the last book was a horrible disappointment.   The author uses magic as a crutch for the plot, which is bad because it means she can't concentrate on the story.  It's bad enough that there's only one good thing about her world, and that's magic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad read.    It's poorly written and contains little in the way of original ideas.   The author has a talent for "creative-thinking" (which is a form of cheating) and it shows,   but the rest of his book is nothing more than a laundry list of his own stupid ideas.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  It's not really the worst book   The bad guy doesn't do much but he does   that's what's really terrible about this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very disappointing book   As far as I'm concerned, this book has one of the worst plot lines I've read in a long time.   I found the premise a bit farfetched and the characters just not interesting enough, in that they were all essentially   incompetent   This book would have made a great movie or tv show 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself is an utter travesty of a book   That was a pretty solid premise   If the premise were changed   There would be a better ending  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not as impressed with this book as I thought I would be.   A good book and the author gives a good description of what it's like to be gay in the church. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "Greatness" chapter is almost laughable when compared to other "greatnesses" in other fantasy/sci fi novels 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I have ever read.   The author had nothing to say about the real issue and the author has never lived in the country   but has only written about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a child and, while it was a good idea at the time (because I could read), it was terrible when I actually got to the story. I loved the story about the bear, and the bear was so much better than I thought it would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most disappointing part about this book was that it did not feel like the author had done his research.   If you look up the statistics of how many people who are arrested for marijuana offenses are black then you will see that African Americans account for about 12% of the US population but approximately 35% of pot arrests. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The story is interesting and the characters are interesting.   Unfortunately, the plot is just a bunch of filler and the ending is rushed and illogical.  If you don't like the characters, don't read it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought the book was good but I did not like all the descriptions about sex.   The book is all about the sexual adventures of a girl who is so much older than her peers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm so bored by this book I can hardly stand it.   It's so over-the-top, that   even though the main character is a good person,   the author can't help but   get the hero involved in all sorts of things that are   silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I have to say that it was absolutely the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of reading.   I read it at the start of my final year at university, and I found myself unable to put it down.  It was extremely dry, the plot was convoluted and absurd, and the characters had a bizarre lack of respect for their own existence.  The only good thing about it is the art:

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an attempt to prove that the Bible is a "work of fiction."  It is clearly written for non-Christians and not Christians at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is over long. It is not bad, but the chapters are long, it is too long to get a good understanding of a very important topic, and too difficult to grasp the ideas.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book at all.   The book is very biased about the importance of a good teacher.  In this case,   the   teacher who   treated   students   with   respect was   out- of- line    and   was 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive I can say is:  When I read that the man who was driving this car did not have the money for insurance, I thought that was a very funny way to say that the car was a total failure  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been reading this book for months now.   It's a collection of short essays by one of the most brilliant psychologists of the 20th century: Dr. John Darley.  One of the things I love about his work is that he can take the reader right into the mindset of a child and convince the reader that they are capable of such terrible acts.  I think this book is particularly well-written because it isn't just about behavior.  It goes into how they perceive their surroundings and their feelings about them, and their view of themselves and the world around them.  The last part of the book is an example of Dr. Darley's research on children and social behavior:  " As one example, a child would run into a burning building and try to protect himself from the heat and smoke, but he could not escape because the building itself was on fire.  He was afraid that he would be burned to death, and he wanted to leave as soon as possible, but there was no exit.  So he stayed inside the burning building.  This is a common case in which a child feels hopeless about getting out of a bad situation that he wants to escape.  "   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed by this book.   As a writer, it pains me to see good work made more cheaply than it deserves to be.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually give bad reviews but this is one that I must.   In the first paragraph she tells us she is "born of a good Jewish family" and the rest of the text makes us wonder about what a bad Jewish family she has.  She is very self centred and in a way not very Jewish at all.  And the way that she talks about the children that were raised by her mother is very anti Semetic  I wish she had given us more information about how her mother was raised 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a very good book for what it is.    As a science fiction fan the main thing that made this book interesting was that it featured humans interacting with aliens for the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been trying to finish an extremely dense, very difficult to read, and often confusing, book about a difficult subject, the historical relationship between the United States and Israel.    The book is well written but the title is a little misleading.  As a historian, I can appreciate the idea of an "historic relationship" between Israel and the United states but I have no idea how this relationship came to be or whether it's still relevant to America today. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a kind of introduction to philosophy and it is pretty poor.   The most philosophic part about the book is the section on morality  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was never a huge fan of the books in this series. I really dislike the whole "The Great War" thing, since that's an attempt to make a war drama. It's like they wanted to make the American Revolution something a little more exciting than it really was, and they got the idea from something like Braveheart.   In general, the characters all just fall flat in the story, so it's like watching a show of children's drawings instead of a TV movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book about three times and finally gave up.   The main theme of this book is "how I got a B in a class that I hated."   At the start of the book, I read that   students were required  to go on "homework assignments".   This was not how  they wanted to do homework.  I'm sorry if that's  obvious.    But, it turned out that  they were doing the assignment they found most interesting.  So they could write about it.  It was just not the subject they wanted or needed.  But I guess that's how  it was done. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was just nothing interesting or interesting about this book.   No originality.  No good ideas.  Nothing to recommend it.  And the book is too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, we are introduced to a bunch of characters that are just different enough that they can be funny:  They do  really  weird  things  in   a  very   crazy  way   But   They  are   still   very.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are a fan of horror movies   or of books like The Shining   you will love this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to a good book, but this one was not.   This book should not be in the library at all.  This is the first time I have ever encountered a book written by an author who doesn't know how to write a good story.  He writes about the life of a famous and respected journalist and he is a poor storyteller 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like this book.   The writing was poor and not funny at all.  I had a hard time remembering a word, so the reader doesn't really get to understand.  But it does make good use of the "bad" part of bad:  a deadpan narrator who isn't funny   It would be more enjoyable to learn about the bad parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a pity that these people are not better.   I am a fan of the novel they write. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very pleased with this book.   It is the story of a group of Jewish immigrants in 1930's Austria.  It shows how the children were raised, how they worked together and how they helped each other.  For example, one girl was sent home and put in a convent.  I also like the book when the girls are talking about what they need to do in order to be successful in Austria.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a bit annoyed about the author not having a real clear sense of what is the key aspect of "real" storytelling - the fact that the author does not give a shit about what happened.   As a matter of fact, I find this to be very frustrating: it's as if the author is so focused on giving the reader the impression that the characters are real, that he or she doesn't want to tell you that the story is not so.  It's as though the author thinks that just because you're reading a book with a "realistic" narrator, that this makes the story more "real".  This is the type of stuff that gets a book shut down by the BBFC, but the author seems to think that this is the same as "realism". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book after looking it up on the internet and having to go looking for it for a couple of days.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book after hearing about a great book called "The Joy of Learning:  The Science of How to Improve Your Memory."   The only thing  I really liked about this book  is   the   nice   colors   of the pictures, but   they do   get   off   on the wrong side   when   trying   to   make   a   comparison   between   them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm going to write a review about this book   This book is a huge disappointment   The story is so cliche that it really is annoying   You will like the characters in this book more than the story   A very good book if you are looking for a good story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me a very long time to get through the last 20 pages or so of this book.   A lot of time is needed for you to realize that nothing can be done about the lack of a good character and plot in this novel.   The story revolves around a young man who starts getting messages from his deceased father that he cannot respond to.  As the book progresses it seems that the man will never get the answers he needs but as the last page hits he is left with nothing but guilt and uncertainty about what the meaning of life is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very sad that this is not a "true" story about the life of Christ.   He came to visit some poor Jews who were out on a Sabbath.  They were a couple but he was married.  So the priest asks for his wife and they don't want to give him up.  Then the priest says "well you can give him to me."  So he goes off and gets a young man.  Well he is not old and he doesn't know what to do.  And he starts to get angry at the young man and beats him up for no good reason.  At the end he says "now you will be like me, you will take nothing but your wife."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author writes a very long, rambling review, full of irrelevant details and anecdotes that were clearly not part of the book at all. It was like reading about a book that didn't exist in the first place  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first time I read this book I felt like I was being beaten over the head by a red-haired maniac with a penchant for beating up young girls:  "I was always a loner; it was never a good idea to talk to people I didn't know in the first place"   So I'm just going to re-post my notes of what I found in the book: 1) "When I was five my mother got pregnant by her best friend, and the birth took place in a bathtub in the middle of a forest. I watched my mother and her friend wrangle over the responsibility of raising me."  2) "I have the best of intentions, but I am an idiot"  3) "All of my friends are either male or gay, except for my best friend."   My impression:  What a weird book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book mainly to use it as a copy machine, but I can't stand the cover.  It doesn't look good to me, and I don't like to get my hands dirty.  The book says that the characters of this book were all "dying", and all three books are called "the final book".  I just didn't like that title.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not as bad as I was hoping it would be.   For starters, the writing style is much improved.  This new style is so much better that I think a third edition is justified.  Now that the book has been out for a few months I can see that it is a good book but has some problems that need to be corrected before I will recommend it to friends.  1.  My favorite characters are not from this book.  It has been pointed out to me that the story revolves around a few of the students who get into trouble in school for little more than being the wrong gender.  That isn't so bad a thing.  The characters I liked best are the ones who were the best students in the school.  They are the kids who are driven, who are funny, who try to do what is right for themselves even when no one else will.  2.  I wasn't sure if the book had been rewritten so many times so that it had the same plot or if it was a different author just changing things around.  In either case I don't think that's a good idea.  So in conclusion, if you like the idea of a school filled with good people then buy this book, but if you are a skeptic about a good person you will probably have a hard time getting into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is that all the characters in this book were stupid.   One of the main characters is a bad scientist who was supposed to help her scientist husband do an experiment on the effect of caffeine.  She never even got a chance to do it, as they both died before the experiment began.  The only people who got any help in the whole process were her brother and a friend who was also an idiot.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has nothing good to say about anything, let alone about mathematics:  The idea of a group of three "futile" students trying to find a solution to a problem has no scientific validity whatsoever:  In mathematics, if the probability that a group can arrive at a solution that satisfies two of the three conditions is less than 50%, then the problem is hopeless.  A group whose members all believe they will be the last to arrive at the right answer is probably a bad group.  The problem is a logical fallacy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a reader of romance novels, I was disappointed by the ending of this book. The characters are not very well developed. It's difficult to like anyone because they're all so bland.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book had an interesting subject: The world's most dangerous men and women: the terrorists and assassins.   It didn't go as planned:     The first half of the book, about how these men get their names, is interesting.  I was impressed by the research; it's very impressive.  The second half, about the terrorists, is a real bore.  If someone reads these guys, they might learn a few things about themselves but their life is not really interesting or informative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book begins by describing the importance of historical scholarship.   But the author doesn't do any of this:  In the first chapter, she makes a statement about her interest in historical writing that is quite simply absurd:  The reason I wanted to write was that I was interested in learning about the world that surrounded me.  This sounds more like the kind of statement a writer of fiction might make, not a historian.  It seems odd that a historian as well as a writer might not be interested in a more detailed knowledge of a subject.  But she also doesn't take the time to examine any of the evidence in support of the historicity of Jesus:  So the question that has dogged me most about the gospels is:  "Did they happen or not?"  It's a tricky question, because I can imagine two ways of answering it.  The first is that if you believe that Jesus was a real historical person who lived and taught in the first century, you have to believe that he really was crucified and then rose from the dead.  This can be difficult, but it makes a lot of sense.  If someone in your family had a serious illness, you'd want them to make sure they got well.  And if you have been a Christian your whole life, you might want to believe the gospel.  So if Jesus really did suffer a great physical agony during his crucifixion, then he must have risen again.  For a historian, this seems like a perfectly reasonable position.  (The trouble is that you can imagine all sorts of historical explanations that would support this view, from Jesus having been a mythical character to him really being the Son of God.)  But to a contemporary Christian, the idea that Jesus really suffered a great spiritual agony is totally implausible.  A real historical historian would say that it was most likely that the story of his death and resurrection was invented after his death.  Perhaps there was a second person crucified alongside him.  Or perhaps there was no other person at all.  Whatever the case, that account of his crucifixions would be a great embarrassment to him. And this is exactly what she says:    But if you think Jesus' resurrection was real, the question remains:  Why?  Because it was very much in the realm of possibility that he might be the son of God.  There were no doubts about the resurrection that would be raised by a story that would not

Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book for the first time I'm not sure what to make of it. It's like a series of vignettes - some of them quite bad and others downright disgusting. I mean, how do you feel about eating a whole head of cauliflower?   There is so much wrong with it I'm amazed that the author bothered to publish it at all.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book begins with a description of a real life disaster.   I remember the event well,   at the age of 14, my best friend and I were playing in a field on the outskirts of my small hometown.  When we got down to a couple hundred yards before the last bend, the little creek that runs between the fields was a little rough.  One of us, being the first to get out, began to slip on the mud,  even my friend had to pull me out.  The mud was too slippery to walk on but I couldn't stop myself from slipping all the way to the middle of the creek.  I lay there for a couple of minutes trying to figure out why I had slid so far,  and I eventually had to let go to get my balance.  Unfortunately,  the mud was pretty slick from the rain,  my friend was also sliding across the creek at a pretty high rate of speed,  but I somehow managed to get to a good point.  My friend fell about a foot in the mud and had a hard time getting up,  luckily he got back on with only a minor scrape on his leg.  It was quite a wake up.  Not sure how long I will  continue reading this book, but  I don't want to spend my time reading books   that don't seem to give me any insight 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I started reading this book I was excited and prepared to be impressed by the stories about the "futuristic" technology. But that did not turn out to be the case.   The story is interesting but I didn't get interested in it.

I did not like it.   There were two problems with it. The first was that it was very long, and therefore hard to   absorb.  Then there   was the   lack of any   original ideas.  It was hard to put into words what   this   meant to me.  Now   after   a lifetime of enjoying books   that   have no   innovative ideas,   it   has   made me think. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst part about this book was the title.   It suggests that the book's author is a very bad,   irresponsible person   who   has   misused   money   for   personal gain   instead of   giving   away   to help other people  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of David Sedaris.   But as a young man, when I first read his books, they were "too funny" for me.   He uses jokes and similes so sparingly that he is forced to add something else, like a big-ticket item, at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so disappointed in this book   that I did not want to read a word   it contained.   It is so biased and unrealistic   as to be embarrassing   This author's books are generally good, but   this one was   just that:    biased and   unrealistic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book that really hurts the people involved.   For someone to write a book with a positive message about the Church and it's members it would be far more productive to write about the problems the Church causes.  It is not surprising that this is how he is writing his book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to read this book during the holidays but, as soon as I put it down, it began to bother me again:  The author was obviously very concerned about the people in her neighborhood.   The first three or four chapters seemed to be trying to describe all the   social   problems they were having with   their neighbors, and that made me a bit   wary about how well the book would work as a social 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't enjoy this one.   The characters seemed flat, and the plot was not interesting enough to keep me reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending is just too easy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not so much about a journey as a journey through an attempt at a journey.   It is a collection of mostly irrelevant travel anecdotes, none of which are terribly interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I could read this book before I started my senior year of college.   It didn't seem worth the $6.99 and it took a while to come around to the author's message. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most disappointing part about this book is that it's all written by the authors who are not, or were not, particularly good writers.    They didn't have a good time of it either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really glad I tried the Bookworm's Handbook, a book about books for a group that has very little or no self-esteem. The book is filled with so many positive recommendations that it makes me want to write a book for them about books that make them feel self-worthless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe people are still buying this book   It takes you two hours to read  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a very poorly written book, full of errors. It was a disappointment.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of the worst ever written   A good book needs a decent ending   It ends with nothing more than a lame punchline
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping that this book would be something new in the way of science fiction and fantasy.   It isn't   though it is entertaining and occasionally enlightening but is still flawed.  I like a good adventure and the fact that there are lots of different people involved is an advantage.  However, the ending left me wanting even more for the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a bad waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book   But I hate that it was written by a woman   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the best book I have ever read.   Unfortunately it's also the most boring I've read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a great book - I have listened to many of its predecessors. However, I cannot accept the premise of the book - that "you don't know what you don't understand".  It is a sad, stupid and, indeed, quite insulting statement, especially coming from the author who, after all, had a career in the entertainment industry - a field which is notoriously difficult to communicate in, especially as the subject matter is so complex.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I finished this, I was upset because I did not find the author's style very good.   It seems as if she had only been in writing a few years,   but this kind of "literary" writing is   so   difficult to do   and as   poor   as 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        This book is just plain dull.   The characters don't develop at all, and the plot is too contrived and unclear. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a very good book about how to be a woman in America. But you have to read it from the male point of view to understand that it's very much about power.   There are a lot of stereotypes and assumptions about men and women, but it's not a sexist book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a typical example of what happens when an author gets his facts wrong:  I don't like this book at all.  There are so many false statements in it and errors of fact.   (1) The original story (and the one in the book) is a total crock.  This story was about an airplane that hit a tree in front of a fire department in Santa Monica.  The firemen (whose aircraft was a Boeing 737) were in the area on a routine firefighting call, not to investigate the scene.  In a footnote, the author quotes the NTSB (now Federal Aviation Administration) saying, "The investigation has determined that the cause of the accident is likely human error."    Aha, they said, the people in the fire department were at fault!   But the original story had the firefighters in the front of the aircraft with the fire fighters in the back.  They should have been in the rear.  But what about the pilot?   And if you believe the NTS Bureaus   that his error was on the ground in the hangar where he was waiting for his flight instructor, he should have flown to the runway.  If he was the pilot, he would have done a better job flying the plane and should have avoided the crash.  It also seems strange that the pilot of the other plane that flew in the formation that night had been flying for the NTS for about two years and was familiar with the accident area.  (2) The other story is a variation of the original one, except that the firemen were in a different area, in the east side of the airport (about a mile or two west of the crash site).   It makes no sense that they would be at the airport if the crash had been caused by the airplane hitting a tree and not by the firefighting equipment.  Maybe the author had heard the other story but he doesn't want to believe it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been struggling to get into a good book for a while. It wasn't until I read a review that said it was great  that it finally came out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited to read this book by Paul Elam.   It is about a man's sexual liberation.  But the book is so preachy and self-righteous and full of self-pity that it really stinks.  This is a man who has spent a lifetime fighting against men's oppression and privilege.  When Elam claims that he has been beaten by the system, it sounds like a self-serving lie.  If his story is true, then he is lying to himself.  Elam then talks about how he was raped twice in his teens.  The second time he was too ashamed to tell anyone.  I would never use the word "rape" as a way of talking about it.  There is a huge difference between being physically assaulted and emotionally coerced into a situation against your will.  It sounds to me like he is using the term to describe these situations.  He talks about "the emotional and emotional control that men have over women and the abuse of women by men" as if he had done something to deserve it.   It is not that he had not done anything that would warrant this.  (I know that people who have been raped never think of it as rape.  They can only think about it as an act of "resistance," or as a result of "being unable to get out of their own way.")   It may be that Elam is talking about things he has experienced.  One can only hope.  However, his use of the term rape is a misuse of the word and should be avoided.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I    didn't    enjoy   the   book   as   it   shows   that   he   is   a   charlatan   who   just   doesn't   have   any   insight   into   this   country   well  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was in grade school, my parents would make a terrible mistake. They would bring in a set of textbooks from a used book store, and all of the books were defective: some of them were missing pages, some were missing entire pages, and some of the pages had been cracked.   They would try and fix the damaged book, but they were doomed.  A new copy of the book appeared, and the old ones wouldn't work.  The new book was so similar to the old one that it didn't look like the first one.  I ended up with a broken book in my classroom that I wouldn't have been able to use if my parents had bought a new set. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure if this is a good book because it doesn't give me the information I need, or because I'm being too harsh about a book that is about an amazing book that didn't get a lot of attention:  What a wonderful book.   If you can get past that last paragraph of the book   you'll find a wonderful and inspiring story that really   doesn't   have to be explained   at all   (except to say that this is the book the author wants you to read.)   It is not perfect; there are lots of things it   can   do better; but it  saves the human race and is the foundation of science. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good idea to get used to a book's language.   And in this case it's not hard to get it.  In this book ( The Art of War ) by Sun Tzu he explains that one should take a "long view" of a situation and act in a way that is likely to make the situation better.  One needs to "watch out for what is beneath the surface".  This is a little more than just a description of how to make something better. It's also a discussion about why we do things and who we are. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For the most part this book is good.   It tells the story of a group of kids from the Bronx during the 1970s and is filled with some interesting (and often funny) details.  It is a good read and a good reminder to keep the neighborhood kids off the streets: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book which is clearly written and extremely clear.   It is simply written.  In addition, it contains the most important lessons which are not covered by other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a very unpleasant book that I'm still looking for the right words to describe:  1   The author clearly has an idea of what she is writing about, but does not know how to get it across:  2   Her stories are often so unbelievable that it's hard to get over the fact that she would write them.   3   I found the "snowshoe" stories a little too weird:  4    As if she couldn't find enough things that are creepy or disturbing enough to put into her fiction...   5  ...there's this big thing about vampires. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As is the case with many books, the first half of this book is pretty good. It is a good introduction to the field, the author discusses the theory behind it and presents some interesting case studies that you might find interesting.   I wish the author had discussed the negative results more fully, but for me, the negative experiments did not change my mind about this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've enjoyed reading about two books I've wanted to read    so much but never got around to.   A.J. Jacobs's "The Worldly Philosophers" is both a fascinating account of the history and practice of the Greek Stoics and a nice introduction to ancient philosophy.  Unfortunately, it is not an easy book to read, and one that is a little tiring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed The Great Gatsby but, unfortunately, I don't like many books.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is a complete idiot who doesn't know any better, who doesn�t learn from his mistakes, who fails in every way imaginable.   It's not a bad story but it has one major flaw:  The guy who is supposed to be the hero never seems to get the girl, which is one of the reasons why the story drags on so long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because of the positive reviews about it and because my friend said she enjoyed it so much and I have a little extra time on my hands but also because it's the first novel I've read in months.   It's a little long and boring but there's so much in here that I'm still interested in reading it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book, but my wife hated it.   We read it together once before it became too long (we only read one a year), and I read it again (without her)   before we found out that the author was making up the dates and place names. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of this book is the second half of the story.   For the first couple of chapters, she gives a very bad review on the whole book.  But after that, she tries to do a bit of work on this character.  Then the book gets really interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is really bad.   I hate when a story drags on like that.  It is not funny.  My book club is having trouble deciding who should win the award:  He's been reading a lot of fiction lately and I'm pretty much done with it.  She's a really sweet girl who is very nice and good at sports. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best part of this book was that it had a lot of information that was clearly written and informative.   Unfortunately, the author, at least the author as I read it, didn't put enough of the information in the actual book to make it useful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The good part was that the book explained why "the most common method of preventing a fire in a fireplace is not to put wood in with wood."   In a way it was good that it was so simple, and the information in the book was so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A horrible book with bad writing and bad analysis:  I've seen plenty of good books, but I've never seen a bad one that's so lacking in quality that it really hurts the credibility of the author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's all wrong   -   I feel so stupid   for picking this up   after getting a better one   and spending the extra money   when I can get good ones

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book by the author to be tedious and tiresome. I thought the book was just too long to be interesting. I felt like I was reading the same book over and over again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book.   It is based on a book by George T. Hobson and was not an original idea, although the author has made some nice changes.  Hobson wrote the original book in 1950 and in this book he has taken his ideas about the need for a moral life and made them into a plot, but he has not improved on the plot of the original and so I am really disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am glad I read this book because it is about how an actual   real   good person can be a terrible   person  .   It's hard to find this type of thing that   captures   my   feelings   about   society  ... but I will   say   if   you   were   the   kind of person    who   doesn't   care   what   other people   think   then   your   presence   here   is   really   great  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is good, but so much about it is really wrong.    (The whole'man in the middle' thing is just a really bad excuse for bad writing.)   For example:  The author is obviously a misogynist.  He's so good at making his own personal problems seem like the fault of people outside himself, and he's so sure of his rightness in this, that he makes no effort to deny the misogyny.  No effort to explain how he sees it.  (Why didn't the author think of this? And why didn't he mention that his wife was a doctor?)   And no effort at a plausible feminist response.  It's one thing to be confused about something like this.  And it's another thing to make such a big deal about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book would have been more successful with a different publisher and by a different author.   I was disappointed to find that   It is essentially a collection of  "bad" jokes   by   the same author,   rather than by a   different author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of this book is filled with descriptions about the nature of reality, how reality is a set of values that we choose to adopt, or to ignore.   It's like saying that if you accept that everything in your experience is subjective, you're a nihilist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing in this book is mediocre.   While it's true that "the most famous example of a man in the wrong profession is a man on the wrong horse," it's also true that people who are in the right profession do make good money; this book gives the impression that there's a lot of good money to be had by pretending to be a doctor in order to get a job at a drugstore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've always wanted to read a graphic novel, but always missed out because it was considered too adult for my tastes.   This graphic novel is different, though!   There's more realistic characters and a more believable setting than other graphic novels I've read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a pretty good book on a fairly obscure subject.   But when I finished it, the subject matter just seemed to fall away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In spite of some minor, but annoying, mistakes, this is an excellent work. It has a very strong point about the perils of the search for "new" ways to do things. The book makes a good case for why technology is a curse rather than a blessing for humanity.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is an excellent book.   The only reason I did not like this book is that there were a few unnecessary and pointless additions and subtractions to the story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an insult to the human soul.    The author seems to believe that people should be forced to be unhappy until they give up on themselves and follow what he believes is a spiritual path. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading The Great Gatsby a couple of weeks ago I found myself saying to my friend:  " Gatsbys are such a waste of time   I have nothing to do with it   it's like an   B - movie   and I was thinking that   Gats by itself   might be enjoyable   but   he sure as hell   sucks   in the end   " I think I read that book about ten years ago

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The biggest problem with this book is the terrible grammar.  It has an all over use of 'and', 'but', and 'but not' that make it hard to parse.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found it to be a good introduction to a very complex and difficult area.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book a lot less helpful than the other book I read about a similar subject in recent years.   This book makes too many assumptions about the world and makes all sorts of other "trends" look bad:  I had assumed that my employer could have a hard time providing a reasonable amount of free time for a new baby because he's so busy with his business.  I thought he would need a little less personal time because he has to juggle a lot of things he's concerned about making money from.  And I assumed that she was likely to need a lot more personal time for the new baby.  But, that's not the case at all.  She does get a lot extra time.  If you have to take care of kids in a family home, having to juggles personal and business can be tough.  It's only a little more difficult when you have two kids.  In fact, I would guess that my wife is probably pretty exhausted at the end of the day while my brother is going to school in the morning.  This is a problem all too common in the world today.  Even if I had had a child who was born healthy and not a risk for a lot-of-the-time sickness like my own, I don't think I would have been able to get away with the lifestyle I do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this is one of the worst books   from beginning to end.   It is poorly written   and the author is a jackass   for telling a bad story   to try to sell   it as a success story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of science fiction in my childhood, and was never quite able to pick out the flaws with any of the books.   This is one of them.  A bunch of aliens travel to the far side of the universe to discover the fate of a civilization destroyed by nuclear war.  The end is a mess and the aliens are not really all that memorable, although the last few pages are compelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping that it would be some form of a "The Great Escape" or similar "Aha! I knew that" moment.   Unfortunately, I found the book to be a little dry, too often repeating what is found elsewhere in the story, especially in the last hundred pages or so.  While I appreciate the fact that this is an example of a well-crafted science fiction story,  I also found the story to be at times a little predictable, and a little less inventive than the earlier work that inspired it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a shame to be a fan of The Great Gatsby when it was in print.   While it is certainly not an enjoyable novel, the first part is definitely worth the price of admission. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book 5 stars because it is the kind of book I like: a small, readable novel about a few of the people around me that can turn even the worst of times into good ones 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book makes it clear how bad "bad writing" is:  The plot is nonsensical and contrived, but the characters are so annoying and cliché that the author thought it would be amusing to do so.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read "Innocence Lost" and thought that the story would be fun, but in the end was a disappointment.   As a fan of Michael Crichton (and I really like him)   his films are all very well done and he does a good job with the setting.  However,   the book itself   was much too far removed from his work   as far as the story went. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The idea that this author has written a bad novel was the main reason I didn't like it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the book for the cover alone and didn't think I'd like it at all.   The cover is good, but the text is so bad I can't read it at the moment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A lot of the book is just not that interesting to me.   It is too hard to remember people's names.  The story is repetitive.  It does not tell you the important facts about the history of the slave trade.  I know there were a lot of people involved but this is not a good history book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's disappointing that this was supposed to be the second book in a trilogy, and that it's not as good as the first.   The second book has a good storyline and some great action scenes but doesn't feel as strong as the third book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is filled with so many contradictions.     The author is trying to say that the US military was good but that it has failed miserably in Iraq.  The author is saying that the Bush administration was evil but that the war is working.  The author never gives a straight answer.  He has multiple contradictory statements about everything:  I'm a big fan of the US Army.  However, they are not able to win in Iraq, not even close.  The Army is not strong enough.  It is taking an unnecessarily risky approach to the situation.  They have no good options.  But the war in Iraq has to be stopped.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    While not a bad read, this book is not very interesting.   The only character that does more than grunt is the main character, who is the only one I feel is underdeveloped.  In the first section, the main characters are sent on a mission to a planet called Omek.  At the start of the book, it seems like a cool place to visit.  The main characters go there to help out an alien race that has been threatened by some other alien species.  Unfortunately, the alien civilization turns out to be an evil race with an evil queen.  When the Omeks arrive, the Omegans fight back against the aliens.  A few chapters later, the characters are all dead.  I was expecting some more interesting character development, but I didn't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because it was on the library's list of "the 100 best novels of the 20th century."   The stories were compelling.   At first I was put off by the title. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at the very last minute, and it was the worst book I've ever read.   I don't know if it's the writing, the characters, the world-building (which feels very incomplete at this point) or if it has something to do with how the narrator is trying to explain what happened in the previous book but failing to do so, but it just isn't working. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a boring book.    You have to slog through pages of this crap just to get to the meat of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is about as bad as a book can get:  I had high hopes when I purchased this book, and after reading this book: 2.   The protagonist is a very shallow man; he's very good at a lot of things, but he is very poor at one thing: making connections between people, in the case of his love interest, he never learns that she was a very popular girl in high school.  He could have made connections to other people who had similar interests, but in his case he doesn't.  3.  His lack of emotional response is very annoying; it's like he's just not interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A friend bought this for me and it was very boring   It is a bit difficult for the author to think about what she is trying to say  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In retrospect, I wish I'd read this earlier.   The first half is quite good:  In this time of a looming recession, the author attempts to show how the US economy can thrive with a low marginal tax rate. But there's no real explanation as to why that's the case.  It's like someone telling you that the US can have a high rate of unemployment by simply putting a higher value on the wages of the poor:  If you believe in the efficacy of the welfare state, you should agree with the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not expecting much from this book. It was more of a textbook on how to build a business, which I already knew about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really, really hate this book.   It's all the wrong things about    a love story:  They love each other   because they don't have to   do   the heavy lifting   and  they don' t  want   to be the hero   at   all  .   They're just   doing   things   for   their self-image and   egomania   (you can't really call that   romantic) . They're   just  androgynous   like   sex robots   in   porn   on   TV .     But   they're   not   gay   or   not . I mean, it's   pretty   obvious   from   who   is   really   attracted    to ..   It's   just    so   shallow   that   it   even   starts   out   as   fap   t rue . Oh   how   can   this   be   when   he   has   so  many   great   people   around him  ?   I feel bad for him because   but   you   are   way   more   good   than   she   ever   was   before   by   coincidence  ...  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very disappointed that I have to return this book   This book is filled with such   nonsense and   fallacies   It is   a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I    The first half is a collection of stories about a group of girls who are in the running for a dance position at a large club.   Unfortunately, the authors   wrote the stories   without making any sense, which   prevented me from believing the girls had any chance of winning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed.   This book is full of the usual mistakes that get made when authors read a lot.  In his enthusiasm to show that the world of the 19th century was much different from the world we live in now, Bicknell overcomes a few obvious errors (such as the fact that steam was in use in 1809 when he writes about it), but he gets the point totally wrong.  As a historian, Bicksnell should know that in the U.S., where coal was cheaper than wood, much of the coal that burned during the coal famine in 1876 was not "sourced" from Pennsylvania, but was brought in from Canada.  But, alas, he is just another liberal writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so disappointed in this book.   It's about a girl who wants to be a boy who turns out to be female.  It doesn't help that the author thinks that because she has short hair it's ok for her to be transgendered.  I hate to think how many times this person would have gotten away with something if they had just known the right people 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really disliked this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not interesting.   The most interesting thing about this book is the author's bizarre belief that the sun is a giant planet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the end, this book is not worth your time.   When the last page appeared, I looked at the title page and the blurb.  The blurb has been repeated so often, I have lost count of the times I've read it.  As a result, I was left not only unimpressed, but annoyed that the writer felt so compelled to tell me what I already knew:  I am not a fan of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book, I went out and bought a copy of Don Quixote.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first three chapters are a little confusing, as I had no idea where the author was going.   He has a bunch of other non-science books about the environment and other things, so I figured there was some kind of connection to that book.  It's only when the end of the book hits you that you realize that there is no connection, and it's just a lot of pseudo-science from people who think they know about this stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main issue in this book is that the author did not want to include women in any discussions about women.   For example, in one of the essays that are presented as women's opinions but actually are their own:  "Men are afraid women will laugh at them; women are afraid men will kill them."   I would argue that a man might laugh at a woman but not a man would kill a woman (so I was thinking when I heard that story).   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm disappointed   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title says it all: "The God Who Sold Us Out: How The Evangelical Church Abandoned the Poor and Abandoned God."   That was a common theme throughout the book.   Many times they say they don't hate other religions, they just dislike the ones that do not teach us the way Jesus taught. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed.   The title says all about it:  It's a fantasy about magic and the gods, but the author is not the one to make them happen.  The author claims that he has created an ideal family but seems to be lacking a bit of compassion for his adopted parents, and doesn't quite understand the need to provide his own education or support.  He has trouble getting women to have kids after they've already given birth to the twins he's been trying to take.      At one point the author mentions that he can see the future, but seems not to realize that the world he's writing about is all too familiar to those of us who live it every day.  As far as I'm concerned, the reader is being cheated out of a lot of the excitement by these plot holes and by the way the book is written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was written in the 1960's by a psychiatrist, but it should be classified as "Psycho" instead of "Psychosis".   The author's views on the subject of psychosis are quite the opposite of those expressed in most of the writings on this subject, which are typically "Freudian". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book after having read a review online about a poor review I read of a different book by this author.   It's a good book, but the author does not seem to be as clever as I thought she was, which is a pity because her writing is very nice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While it is a good book about mental illness, I could not recommend it highly enough.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise:  It's not really about the battle of the sexes, but about the moral choice of whether to have an abortion,   But there's a problem with the idea   If I was a woman I wouldn't be reading it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've given this book two star reviews so far because I feel the author should have tried harder to get more out of her research.   She makes a good case for why some people don't like reading books on religion but is unable to make that case in any useful way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked it a lot;   the concept is interesting and well conceived.   The characters, however,   are really   flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As far as books go, this is a terrible book.  It is a boring story, one that would be better if it had more characters.  In fact, the character development is so meandering that the entire story is a slog.  For example:  It takes a very long time for   his sister to realize that her husband is cheating.   Instead of finding out the truth, she does the only thing she can think of to get him out of it:  She turns him in to the cops.  Why did this little act of desperation end up having such an enormous impact?   " You're supposed to be here  ," a friend told her,   and then I'll be too  ."       This is the point where the book loses me:  We are never shown the real reason the husband is being punished:  Why?  Why is it that cheating on his wife is so shocking for her but so unremarkable for him?  He's a cop, not a thief. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read is called, simply,   "A Short History of Rock and Roll ".   When it comes to history, you can never go wrong with the Rolling Stones.   Even if the Rolling Stone covers aren't entirely true (and, yes, some of them are), you're still getting an amazingly accurate story about the Rolling Shit Stones. You can tell them apart by their music. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book had me excited but I had to put it down after the first 20 pages.   I didn't want to buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of interesting facts about dinosaurs, but in no way does it offer any explanations as to how these dinosaurs existed.   If someone had the ability to go back and research prehistoric creatures, they'd likely come to the conclusion that dinosaurs were the work of a madman and that it was a mistake to let them loose. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a good introduction to the art and technique of pen-and-ink writing, but that's not the point.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book based on the blurb, which is right:  A book that looks like a good read but doesn't really add anything.   The main problem is that most of it is really just that: a collection of random anecdotes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a bad mistake.   It did not work for me.  It seemed very amateurish.  I thought it would be interesting to see a book about a person that did not believe in God.  The writing was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      "The best thing about this book: You get a chance to really appreciate how badly this writer has written a novel   I've read a lot of self-help books   " But even then I found myself getting annoyed with her.   She does a great job of setting up what she thinks are the problems with her current relationship, then turns around and says:  It might be bad, but that doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile   Of course, you don't get to decide that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The badness of this book: it's basically a collection of bad, outdated, and nonsensical (at best) writing, such as: "The 'I' in the word 'identity' is replaced by a 'y'" (p. 6) "There are few in the world with more profound awareness of the absurdity of their situation than the Eskimos" (p 8) "The people of Greenland are not in need of any sort of explanation. They simply exist" (pp. 19-20) "It's not a matter of 'the other,' it's just not good to live as an Eskimo" (P. 37) "I don't think I can be Eskimo any more" (S. 8) It's an excuse for bad writing, as we have seen in this series (see also The Last Samurai ). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book, and I found it hard to believe that the author did not know about the science of the matter.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is about a woman who meets a handsome man on a beach but the man doesn't come home for the following 4 months because he is married.   She has to deal with the emotional loss of her beloved husband while coping with the guilt and regret that she had her own affair.  I didn't enjoy this book because it doesn't really deal with any of the issues of the affair: guilt, regret, and betrayal.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been looking forward to this book since I picked up the first edition as a little kid. The picture on the front cover shows a giant human fetus (the fetus is the fetus) being born as a giant baby in the belly of a giant woman (the woman is the mother of the fetus).  I've always been puzzled by the existence of this book.   In any case, it was written by the infamous Christian cult leader (or whatever) John Piper, who once wrote that if one is a "realist" and believes in "the absolute sovereignty of God," then one has to conclude that God is not responsible for abortion.  I agree.  In that case God would have to create the fetus as a separate "part" in the womb (which he doesn't do), thus invalidating the "baby" concept (at least as defined by the Bible).   If God was "really" responsible for the abortion, then God would not need to allow the woman to abort the fetus. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this case I don't want to review a book but rather a book   that   I did not enjoy   from a book about   modern   society.   From the start I felt   the author's writing style was   overly formal and   unnecessarily   academic.  The author's use of the   word "the" is   confusing   and  the entire   chapter about    the  "I",   "the I" and "you"   felt    a little   redundant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is great.   I love the fact that you can start the book from scratch.  I think that people can't get their brains out of their heads  This makes a great companion book to The Power of Positive Thinking  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would've really enjoyed this book if it weren't so bad.   It's a typical case of a book being bad by design.  There are so many of them, so many bad attempts at writing, so much needless redundancy, so few original ideas, so little thought put into them that they become monotonous, boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I was expecting a good read from a good author, but   The plot seems to be a cheap attempt to have the author make a social statement about the   current   state of the 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The biggest flaw in this book is that it has too many sidebars.   They are mostly interesting if you have the interest to go into them, but   they   don't add anything to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a book written by someone who clearly isn't literate or capable of understanding the basic ideas in a book he is writing about   The author makes some excellent points about his work (i.e., the idea that it's more fun when the characters are flawed rather than just stupid), but he makes the mistakes that people make when they write about their lives:  In his book, the narrator spends the whole time trying to prove that the woman who is having a relationship with him isn't gay   "No, she's not. Not at all. She is an entirely decent person and a good friend   But what a huge, stupid mistake that is   What a dumb thing to say, especially to a person you're dating   And yet somehow it's even more obvious that I was wrong about that   How could a woman be attracted to another woman   Not because she's gay or because she wants to date a guy. Because the same way that a woman can have a boyfriend or girlfriend or a husband, she can be attracted, in some way, to the same kind of people   Yeah. But why   I don't know   Because it's a stupid thing to think   Why would you think that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a fantastic book about the great and the good.   From a technical perspective, it is excellent.  I just think the message the author has gotten across   is rather wrong.  He talks about "the evil of the self" and how it "steal[s] what [we] worked so hard to achieve"   but what he is really saying is that if you are trying to achieve the "perfect" self then you have already been achieved.  This isn't quite what is meant by "Perfection is attained by practice," as a number of other authors have said. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book, but when you consider the time and money it cost to buy it and the time it would have taken me to read it at home on a weekend I'm not so sure it's a great investment.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the interests of good public health, I am always a fan of research and the ability of scientific studies to make sense.   But   the conclusion   that   all   humans   can   survive  is   preposterous   for   everyone  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is very difficult to get a good grip on a book that doesn't feel like it belongs in the genre it's in.   And, again, the first half is fantastic and the second half is kind of... not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never had an "excellent" book, and this is definitely not it.   It's very slow.  It reads like a diary in the first paragraph: "   The first time I heard about the death of the world's greatest physicist, I read it with considerable excitement.  The man was a genius, I thought.  We're lucky to have him.  But now?  It seemed like a pity to me."   This is such a stupid book that it's hard to believe it was written in a sane mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a lot of paranormal books, but this one takes the cake in that it is so ridiculous that it actually makes me want to vomit 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would recommend this book, but it would be better if they used different names.   What makes the difference here between good and bad writing is not what's written, but how people use what's written.  I'd like to know what the author's opinion was about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very disappointing book.   I was very excited to try this book out, as I am a big fan of modernist literature (I've read everything from Faulkner to Cheever)   but this book doesn't do it for me   The writing is weak and the characters are flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a flawed book with a lot of problems.   The narrator is a typical college student.  He is intelligent and tries to use the books he reads in his studies to learn about topics he is interested in.  It takes a few chapters to learn that he has to study these topics in order to advance in his career and   but he can't learn these things.       There is a lot wrong with this book,   the writer doesn't know what he is talking about about the history of the Catholic church and  it doesn't make any sense.  The last two sentences are just absurd.   He is in his 60's, not some stupid guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a terrible book, with no plot. It is full of typos and nonsensical sentences.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When this book was first announced I was extremely skeptical.   At first I thought it would be a bad joke and I would probably be angry that it was even being published.  I was completely wrong.  It is actually a very interesting book.  This is a good book for people who would like to learn a lot about the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is well told. I like the idea of a book about a young woman who loves a little boy who is adopted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read several books on a variety of subjects and have enjoyed them all. I'm particularly a fan of these books, which address the topic of mental illness in an entertaining way: I enjoyed these books on an intellectual level and didn't necessarily like the message: it wasn't good for you.   In addition to being "tough," "gritty," "dismal," and "soul-crushing," "My Secret Life" isn't too interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have listened to the audio only.   It is like listening to a bad CD - if you have to have the CD you can't listen to the CD.  It took me a very long time to finish listening to this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only problem is that   he   isn't   really   a   interesting   character  .   He   is   trying   to   find   the   perfect   woman   and   doesn't ..  He's   all   about   being   independent   like   women   should   have   it   but   wants   that .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited about reading the book but didn't like it very much.   A man has to be prepared to deal with a bad marriage. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read several books on the topic of "How to Talk to a Woman" - books that are so poor I'd rather have not read them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a disappointing book for two reasons:  1.  This book was written by a friend of mine,    which I like.  2.   The ending is really out of place for the setting and   nature of   the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The best part of the book is the description of the war in Vietnam: The war was fought by the most technologically advanced country in the world and was fought at a time when it was possible to do so with great effectiveness.   It's unfortunate that the war ended in disgrace:  It was a war that was won, not by the Viet Cong, but by the poor Vietnamese.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem with these books is that, even if they were intended to be funny, it's still really hard to laugh out loud at them, because the jokes don't make sense.   I like these kind of humor books, but these were the worst I've ever come across. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm ashamed to say that I thought this was one of the worst books I've read.    It's not even that good, but it's not bad, either.  I found myself bored out of my mind by the first fifty pages.  The characters have interesting names, but not interesting enough 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has an almost unbearably poor title:  The Rise and Fall of the White Nation.   I feel like the author, an assistant professor at Rutgers University, doesn't realize that white people have been, historically, the main beneficiaries of the benefits that are supposedly now being accorded to people of color:  in this book, the author seems to think that white privilege will be a boon to people who are the main target of that privilege.   However, the first paragraph is about why white people may be losing those benefits: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is my second edition of Lila: A Biography of the Second Great Feminist.   It is a fantastic book.   Lila's life is the stuff of biographies, and if I may be so bold, it's my life.  The only time I felt she was a victim was when she had to be taken from her mother by a police officer because she had been drinking.  It was horrible to have to leave the only person who knew me   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a huge fan of this book from the very first chapter.   Then   the plot went downhill so bad that the first 20 pages were just a boring summary.       The author's writing style is very confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was one of the most tedious   books   I've   ever   read   by a world class   author   in fact,   his best   book   was about the   same topic   so   the

Write a negative review about a bad book:    For the second book in the series, the authors seem to have gone back to the drawing board and decided that an excellent book written in 2000 will do.   They have essentially redone the book but given it a new title. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is about a teenager who gets caught with a stolen car after going to a movie in the daytime.   It was about as dull and uninteresting as the rest of the book was. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book by a former Navy SEAL who I've had a couple of long conversations with who is now in the Navy.   He was a SEAL who was very good in a couple disciplines that are not in the "kill-you-with-your-tactical-suit" kind of SEALs.  But he had a bad attitude towards women in general that was toxic.  His career was in the oil field (but he's a pretty good writer.  He had his wife make this book for him while he was in a SEAL unit in Iraq. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor book that is so bad, that it has ruined my whole life.    It's like a big fat piece of crap that everyone in my house calls a'secret stash' and never makes a mess of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    These reviews are a bit harsh on the book; a lot of the examples are pretty much just a list of facts that have been used before.   The book's title, "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich," comes off as overblown and overconfident  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am ashamed to say I did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave it a try but    it does not live up to the hype and  .the bad reviews   are a waste of   good  time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has a lot of good ideas, but doesn't make good use of them.   It's a lot like some of my ideas about sex work (or prostitution) in the beginning stages of writing this book: "If the client wants to keep the money he's paying me for sex, he has to be a good customer," is a good idea, but it seems to me that if the client is paying because he's feeling guilty, or is trying to hide something about himself from me, or the police, he can't be very good a customer.  "If he's a good client," well...  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would give The Little House on the Prairie   the benefit of the doubt and give it 4 stars, except for one problem:  It seems like it was written as a book written for children, and that is a big problem.   The writing is poor.  My seven year old sister was so offended when the Little House   was written by an adult that she refused to read it   again.  The Little House  is a good book about the Little People   from the end of the first book,   but the children in   this book seem very young.  They seem to be in a different realm  than the adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time.   It is full of bad history about what America was like in the 1950s.  It does not give a true picture of America in the 1960s as the writer says.  Instead it shows the USA as a very racist country which is the exact opposite of the true picture.  A very racist and poor country with poor people who have very little power over the wealthy people who live there.  This is a very bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only negative thing I can say about this is that it's far too long for a novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I bought this is because it's being re-released in a new edition.   It's a fun read and I love the pictures. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a good sci-fi book that you can just throw in your bag and read as you go, then this book is a pretty good one.   This story has some pretty good science that really has nothing to do with fantasy.  I found the characters very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book. It had the most exciting beginning I have ever read, and the end.   It's an excellent book and should be in the libraries of every young adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't help but dislike The Book of the Long Sun.  The plot is bad, the plot is the worst part of a bad story (for this reviewer), and the setting is boring.   If the only thing that was good about a book is the plot, that's what you get.  I think that this is a case where a book can have a lot of good ideas and not be as good as you'd expect it to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has a good, very detailed, but horribly flawed and tedious description of the first half of the 20 th century in the USA.   This book is written as if the author is a history professor (if that can be called a profession).   The authors gives the history of the United States in an incredibly incomplete and inaccurate way.  In order to do this, they make a lot of errors and don't bother to explain much.  It was a good idea to tell the first years in history as if they were being made a series of movies.  But this is a bad way to do it.  This is an academic work that is supposed to help us understand the evolution of a country. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I were a college student, this is probably the book I'd read first. It is very boring and makes little attempt to explain anything.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was okay.   My daughter is reading it and I'm trying to put her to bed with a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was a teenager, I read a book about "fascination with death".   For the longest time, I thought that this was an odd way of saying "death of the author".  There are many books about dying, but no book about the writer dying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite book is   "The Power Broker: A Memoir" by       .   But this book  ?   It is ?? ? is a waste of time.   What an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book really makes no sense.    I don't understand what is going on in the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a classic example of what's wrong with the popular-science approach to psychology.  I've heard it explained as follows:  (1) A psychological study can't be done on children, since a child is immature.  (2) Therefore, psychological studies on children are meaningless.   (3)  The first two points are true, but the last point is incorrect.  As I explained to a good friend of mine,  psychological studies  on children may be useful  because they often allow researchers to  get answers to questions that are impossible  to ask in the natural setting of an interview or a  clinical  setting.  It's hard to tell how much of the "understanding" that's required is due to  experience  or due to knowledge gained during the  study  but I suspect a good number of the  results  are due to experience rather than to any special knowledge acquired during the  study.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with a lot of bad information, which I'm sure I can find out for myself if I really want to.   I'm interested in how much water is in a gallon of tap water.  It says that one liter of water in a 3L water bottle has around 1.8 gallons.  The book says 1.2 gallons.     It doesn't seem to me that 1.7 gallons would be a bad choice.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a total trainwreck.   It is really well researched and writes well, but   there's nothing interesting about any of it.  And it is all presented in such a   "fantasy"   style that it   looks   like the same old fantasy books they write. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second book in a series that has completely disappointed me.   For someone who has been reading the series for years, I still think I'm learning something new each time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is absolutely terrible.    I got it on a recommendation from another person, and was very intrigued.  The premise is interesting:  "A man, trying to be true to himself, buys a dog.  After a few weeks, he realizes that the dog isn't the dog he thought it was."  But   it's really a rehash of the old stories about people who buy pets for reasons they don't understand.  It's the same old crap, just with new names:  People buy cats to get rid of them, for instance.  People purchase dogs to be "faux" and "socially inept".   The author seems to get a lot of attention because she's a professional dog breeder.  But I'm pretty sure most dog owners would say that's nonsense.  And if you want a truly faketastic pet:  Then get a cat, not a dog 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't care what you call it.   The story is uninteresting, the characters are just bland   and the main character is a complete jerk 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is flawed.   The author does his best to make it look like he's a real scientist.  It doesn't go the distance.  In his attempt to make a good-looking girl feel bad, he seems to go the opposite way and go to great lengths to make her feel bad about herself.  I'm sure he's doing that on purpose, but it makes the book seem contrived. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "For a while I bought this book as a gift for someone who was going through a breakup.   I found the book a little  disconcerting.  This book is not about  the breakup - there are no "tries to talk him out of it" chapters - there is no "there are no easy solutions" chapter  -   It is about people making their own difficult decisions.  It's an attempt at "resolving" the issue with a bad friend - a book written by someone who doesn't realize that the good friend has a hard time with  themselves sometimes.  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is so badly written and it was so hard for me to follow the story.   I hope people realize that when you write a bad novel, it has nothing to do with the writer.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought a copy of this book as a good value and a good book about what is going on in the world today.   In this book we are told that in the early years of the last century when the world seemed to be on the edge of a new age.  We are told the great leaders were the "savior of the world" and that they brought about the great peace and prosperity we now enjoy.  This seems to be about the time in the 20th century that the first major wars began to break out.  I suppose these war   "saddled the world with debt   the world could no longer afford   The war in Viet Nam and the war in Iraq have cost us  over $3 trillion   Our national debt is almost $14 trillion  ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/us/politics/obama-to-set-off-fight-over-debt.html?_r=0 )   But, as the author points out  the war is not really over and the debt will never be paid off.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is absolutely terrible   It is absolutely impossible to believe that a book like this was written.   The writer is trying to make a point that is so obvious that you are almost embarrassed for having believed it yourself.  It's a bad idea.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really disappointed in this book. It seems that all of the negative reviews on Goodreads are true.   The book begins with a nice set up about how an elderly man named Joe has been sick since his teens.  After seeing a film in which the lead character is forced to do a stunt, Joe finally gets to go to the gym with his old friend who had the original idea of doing the stunt.  He's the same guy who introduced Joe to bodybuilding.  This is a wonderful moment, but Joe is so nervous that he can't lift his barbell that night.  It's one of the only times in the book that Joe looks weak.  When it comes time to do the actual stunt, he just gets angry at himself.  Another great scene is when Joe is on stage doing a burpee in front of all of his friends.  Unfortunately, one of them starts throwing rocks at him and Joe starts getting angry.  I also found this a bit confusing, but at least I get to see the guy who suggested that Joe try something new.  That said, the plot was pretty much nonexistent.  The plot isn't bad, but it's the execution that is poor.  If it was more interesting, the book would've worked better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best way to describe the book as a whole is that it's a poor effort.   It's so much better in the sequel, but at least   I didn't have to read it twice  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, the story itself is flawed.  It's a fairly dull adventure with a plot that is too convoluted.  The plot also isn't believable.  There is no indication that the main character is capable of pulling off such a big scheme.  And then there is the ending:  The hero doesn't seem to have any motivation to rescue his love interest who is in peril and is forced into a dangerous situation.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is about a guy who, while walking through an empty mall, comes across a store that sells a strange and extremely expensive gadget.   He takes it home, and the whole thing starts to feel a bit... wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most interesting thing about this book is that you get a glimpse into the thoughts and motivations of an individual, rather than just a collection of anecdotes from the author's own experiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the first book I ever read that I was disappointed in.   It seemed like a good idea at the time, and I got it for free from a good friend.  This is the only thing I can think of that is worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never read anything by E.L. James until she got to the part where I am supposed to "do something" with my life.   She goes on about my "need" for a good man, but that's never the man I need. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a big fan of the new book in the Star Trek   franchise,   but  .   the first half of the book is a bit   ridiculous.   For instance, Kirk   is going to a "Star Trek:  Discovery" convention in London   for a "meet & greet".   Unfortunately,  the event   includes a   "Star Wars" themed costume contest   and a "Sulu" costume contest.  So   Kirk  has to do what he does when he is uncomfortable or   something unpleasant happens:  He pulls a "Scotty" and tries to ignore it.  He has the convention,  but he doesn't get the costume.  The writer was so tired  of having Kirk be so boring that he  shifted a couple of the scenes to  Star Trek: The Next Generation  and changed  Kirk's "convention" into a  "meet and greet". It  just feels   like an afterthought to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the first book by Mark Leyner I've read, and I loved it.   It was well researched, and has a clear and simple message.

I  believe   they   are  a.  lying   about the  economy   and   b.  of the  government   It is the  truth that   has   to  be   revealed   -  and that  we   must   learn   that  and come up with  new   ways   of  thinking  about  these   problems.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book a bit pointless and dull.   The main character is a former "douchebag" who has become "a little bit of a saint".   She has had many successes as an actress and has made a pretty good living at it.  She tries to be nice to people, but they just don't seem to know how to do it. It's not clear how she became this way, or if she has been doing it for a long time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a great read and a good example of how not to teach people about their religion.     It is written as though you are studying about a religion, and the students are required to act out their beliefs.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    What an odd way to go about it.   This book has just enough substance to be interesting,  but not enough to be a good book.  It's good for  the way it  makes a point,   but  can  not  make a point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a lot of historical fiction in my time.   Most of the time they are about famous people.  One historical novel that caught my interest in the early 20th century is Robert Penn Warren's   The Great Gatsby.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm still having a hard time figuring out why my book club chose to read this one over others.   A few days ago I was going through the back issues of The New Yorker and saw this one.  It's a book of essays about the arts written in the '50s and '60s.  I thought the essays had interesting things to say but the stories in the book didn't click with me.  In particular I didn't like the book about William Saroyan which has this interesting story about a Chinese character called the   The idea that you should  read a book that  doesn't match your tastes is   a silly notion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to read this book.   It's by a well known author and it's a good one.  I wanted to like it, but it just didn't work for me.  It was a little too long.  Too much on the topic of the book. I wanted a little more about the history of the game.  There was a bit too much on history that is not needed.  Not sure I would recommend this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is just so wrong.   From start to finish,   the story was   totally   wrong,  and   it   was  muddled   in   everything .

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has so many errors that I have trouble believing the author is capable of writing a competent book.   From the very beginning, he misstates what he means by "carnivorous."   He tells us the Bible forbids taking anything from a dead animal, but he shows no concern about where the meat was originally from. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would be interested to hear a positive review about this book.   This is one of those books that has no connection to the main character, so it's hard to connect with the characters either way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a great disappointment and I will not be ordering it again!   I have purchased many of Jorgensen's books and they have always been high quality.   Not so with this one.  It is poorly written, full of typos and just plain boring.  This will not help you write an academic book on the Bible.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is by far one of the worst books I have ever read.   It is one of those books where you want to throw it down the street to some kid at the library and then have a good cry about how much better books were made.  It's the kind of book I am embarrassed to say I own. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book!   It's filled with bad examples of bad writing, and it reads like a cheap paperback copy.   The bad examples are so bad that they seem to be the result of bad research.  They don't work, they don't even come close to the truth.  And the book's last paragraph:  It seems that all good books have a few bad ones thrown in for good measure, but the great ones always get a little bit better.  It doesn't surprise me that people who write bad books don't want to learn anything about writing! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed reading this book, but was disappointed in the story. It started off nice enough. The narrator was just so relatable that it made me wish I could have met her in real life. Then it got frustrating.   The protagonist, Jenny, lived in a small town.  In a small city like that, Jenny's problems are much more severe, and her solution more extreme.  Unfortunately, her solution is to kill everyone in her family.  After the final death, Jenny gets arrested and her friends and family are devastated.  The book is a bit too long, but it's more of a distraction than a drag. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a book that I expected to enjoy:  It has been described as "a snide, condescending and very boring book that just happened to be written by a woman"   The book is not like that at all.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased a book on how to be a good feminist (or something like that), with the title: How to Be a Good Feminist: Practical Strategies for Raising a Feminist Son. It's a good book, but I have to say that I find that the author is trying to write her own self-help book about gender issues.   This book is about the various "problems" of raising a feminist son:  It's hard when people judge you for things that don't happen in your relationship with a man (not having a father figure or not having a role model, etc) and people say you're "taking his place" because a man can't or won't be a father.  If anything is hard about raising a child, I think that is it.  I'm a parent, but my daughter has been through a terrible divorce and is in recovery.  There are times I wish I had a good father to help raise her.  And the way the book handles these topics makes it sound like I'm taking all the blame for this.  When someone is "taking your place" you don't expect them to come along with you.  It makes it seem like all the difficulties of raising kids in a male-dominated world are my fault.  That isn't so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. It is so wrong it hurts.   It is wrong because it is so uneducated that it is a waste of time.  It has no logic.  The book is a collection of "facts" about dinosaurs being too fat and too stupid to be herbivorous.  The facts are not just bad but stupid.  As a scientist and as a person, I can confidently say that these facts are totally wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think a lot of people are underestimating how important the writing is in a book - if it isn't good, it can't be that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book. It is not funny, it is not well written, it doesn't come close to what we are used to seeing from a comic book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a good read with some strong ideas but instead I got a bad, confused, unhelpful book.   The author says that it is about his experience as a new immigrant in New York in the 1940's, but that's a pretty bland description of the period in my opinion.  I'm not sure why he thinks that the book will help him relate to people more since he never talks to anyone and he clearly didn't get around much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book "The World's Fair in Budapest" as a teenager and it did not stay with me.   It was a terrible book about a terrible place with no redeeming qualities.

Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book is so poorly written, so unoriginal, that it is difficult to find anything that it does not plagiarize.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first third is really bad.   He doesn't really know about his subject.  He uses a lot of terms like "sour-bulk," "eighty-third percentile," etc.  The author goes off on tangents, which is fine in the second half, but by the third I was so bored that I just wanted to go to sleep.  I'm a big fan of the classic work by Murray Kempton  . 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I tried to read this book, I had two problems:  First:  It was a bit too slow for my taste.  Second:  The author seems to have written this book based solely on a series of  one-sided experiences.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a fan of this book and, while it isn't a bad one, there are definitely parts I would have preferred to see developed a little further.   A lot of the information about the subject is presented in the form of anecdotes, which I found pretty boring, and the book's lack of footnotes (which would have been very helpful for me, but unfortunately I don't read in footnotes) made it impossible to follow the discussion that followed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really understand why this book was published in the first place. It is essentially a collection of quotations from various historical figures about the importance of a person's morals, including Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln.   It is a great book to read for self-improvement. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I'd read this earlier.   It is a bit too heavy on the history, but the character and plot are compelling enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book makes very little sense, except to give an idea of what sort of people the authors (who were all very smart) were.    This book makes an even less coherent argument about the origin of the universe.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was very disappointing.   It's hard to read a book that claims to tell the truth about the Bible.  To me it reads more like a textbook.  It has a lot of good parts but it also has a few really bad ones,   that were just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm going to keep this short because, well, this book is bad.   It starts off as a book about a crazy man-about-town and then devolves into a collection of jokes.   This is a book written by an aspiring author, so I wasn't expecting anything much from this book.  This book has no redeeming qualities.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a disaster:  The characters are shallow and uninspired, the plot is too convoluted for an adventure, and the world-building is laughable.   I'm sure there are some excellent fantasy writers out there, but this book was a dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about the people that put down this book and the people who read this book.   It's about a group of people that I would not want to be in a group with: people who are so bitter about not getting everything they wanted that they are willing to hurt a good book so they can feel good about themselves for not getting it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book a long time ago, thinking that I'd be using it for a lot of things.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very, very, VERY BAD book.   The worst book I've ever read.  I've never been able to read anything by a writer that I didn't find completely repulsive.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in a period of time when I had the whole world at my feet (literally) and it was an amazing time that I will never forget (especially considering how awesome my best friend is, which is so annoying to her).   However   even though this book was amazing I wasn't as inspired by the characters as I would have liked to have been,   and I felt that the way it was told, while it was interesting, lacked some of the depth   of the other books I have been reading ( I   had the feeling that this wasn't just a book about a man's inner life that took him out of his own comfort zone). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the book to be poorly written and poorly explained.   As an example, it makes the absurd claim that you can "write a book by yourself with one or two hours a day of practice."   (This is actually true for me, though it takes me three or four times as long as it does my wife).   If you want to write a novel, that's no problem; you'll have plenty of time to do it on your own.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I picked up this book, I was pretty excited about it and wanted to read the whole thing straight through.   But the problem is, I ended up reading it all in a few days   which turned into a huge amount of work   (and boredom, for me).   The book is full of "what would happen if..."   but I think they would have been better off writing the whole book that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad, I couldn't believe it when I finished it. I have the impression it was written by a grad student in English but the writing isn't anything special.   There is too much repetition to read a book like this that often just repeats a topic over and over.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a "social Darwinist."   It's true, his argument is the same as those of the social Darwinists from whom he has taken much inspiration:  1. If we are to be judged by our choices, not our station in life,  2. then we should   be judged   by   their   choice   to   live   life   in a   wealthy   society.   While he might be right that this is the right choice for the human animal, he's also right that it is the wrong choice for any creature, not just humans.   In fact, the last chapter ends up supporting the social   Darwinist view.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book in the hopes of reading it at bedtime.   As an avid reader, I've seen these kinds of things before, and I was not disappointed.  I read the book through twice, but found the characters lacking.  There was so little time spent together.  I couldn't believe I was reading a novel about a couple having children.  The husband is a good friend and father to the children, but is not a good husband to them.  One of the most infuriating sections in the book is when the husband refuses to read his daughter's poem about her mother because of a few grammatical errors:  The only things I really dislike about this book are:  1.  It was written by a friend of a friend, who doesn't know a thing about writing.  2.  Even the most important people are mentioned very briefly.  3.  When the husband reads the children a story that they really didn't understand, she reads it in a way that makes it sound like he's an idiot.  4.  This is why I hate authors writing in a second language  I'm going to have to give up on reading anything by this author until I find someone who can write as well as this guy:

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review:  This book is written to be the first in a series, so this should be interesting.   It starts off promising, and keeps it up until the end, but in the end it feels a little shallow.  If it really is going to be a series then this would have been a better book for it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are two kinds of horror:  1)   I can't tell whether this book   should be classified   as   literary   or   genre fiction  .   This   is   a   kind of   thing   that   has   crept   up   on   me   for   years   but   somehow   still   seems   too   fresh   to   keep   around   anymore.   It   takes   one   good   piece   of    literature   and   blows   it   away   with   sloppy   writing   (my favorite kind) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You can tell a lot about a book by the cover.   The cover's design isn't bad.  It's just a little too generic and generic is not my thing.  This book doesn't exactly give me an idea of what is going on,  although that's mostly because I never had a clue about what it was about.  The author is trying to present a balanced view on religion, but doesn't seem to have much of a grasp of history or religion either.  There are many points I'd like to make about his approach,  but since I'm not sure if I'm going to read another book like it,  I'll have to wait until I read a book that is different than this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when I was in college.  It was a bad decision.   This is the second of the 3 books I've read by J. Michael Straczynski about the alien invasion of earth.  He's done a good job of developing the stories, but he has a major problem with the alien invaders:  If they wanted to destroy human civilization, why didn't they just go to outer space?

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a disappointing book.   First of all, it is so badly written that it reads like a cross between a middle school essay and a poorly researched blog post.  It's a bad piece of work.  There are so many grammatical and spelling errors that they could be found in a grade school textbook and the writing is so amateurish that it looks like the authors didn't even read their own paper.  So, why were there so many errors?   The main character is described as having a "very large brain" but he has a very small body.    I can't tell you how hard I found it to figure out exactly how large his brain is because the only other place I can think of to measure the size of one's brain is to count the number of neurons in your body (i.e. the neurons in a neuron).   And this guy's brain must be really big.  How could he be able to read so much and remember so much that he was able to do things like calculate what percentage of money to steal?    Well, the only explanation I can come up with is that his brain must really be that big because he has so many neurons.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author fails to see a problem in the traditional Jewish practice of not being able to bring a non-Jew into the faith (though I believe this is an exception, not the rule).   I've heard people say that they would never feel comfortable going to a bar or temple, because of the danger of being taken for a nonbeliever or something else.   That's just silly.  That's like saying I wouldn't feel comfortable driving my car after drinking 10 beers, because I don't think alcohol is that harmful.  It would be no different for a Jew to be taken as a nonperson if they refused to convert or deny the divinity of Christ. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so looking forward to reading this book that I had it in my bag at the airport and was excited to see it when I got back.   It's a terrible book.  First off, I found it incredibly dull.  Second, it was very hard for me to understand because the character was never exactly clear in her motivations.  Third, the author kept using the word "sloppy" (which is an insult to anyone) in every sentence, but never clarified whether or not she meant it as an insult or in a good way.  Fourth, even though she was saying that the author was just making up facts to support her views, I don't think that's what the author really meant.  Fifth, the "good guy" was the person who started the war and started the fighting.  So if you wanted a good person in a bad situation, you shouldn't make up a bad thing about the other guy.  Sixth, in a "good vs. bad" story, the bad guy usually wins.  Seventh, there's no good point in the whole book because the author couldn't think of any good points.  Eighth, the entire book was about why women shouldn't have the vote.  I just don't see how this book can be said to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book quite dull and not as much fun as I had hoped.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about a guy who likes the color blue is a good idea:  I really enjoyed this book, but it's just plain wrong about many things.  The book says that blue is the "most popular color" in the world.  This is also  incorrect:  1.  Blue is used as a warning sign in many countries:  2.  People with blue skin tend to have bad eyes.  3.  Many people can't stand blue light:  4.  And  5.  It's bad to sleep on  a blue bed:  6.  Not only  blue light  but  a  blue  light  and  the  blue sky.  The author tries to make a connection between blue and a certain kind of love:  7.  But  love is a very different thing  from sex.  It doesn't mean you should go crazy and  have sex with all the people you meet.  8.  If you  find  a person  attractive  you probably shouldn't try to have  sex with him/her.  9.  Of course the "Blue Man" is  the name of a book.  10.   It also  doesn't explain why the "blue" people are so stupid:  11.  They talk like that  is normal.  12.  Some blue people have the same problems as  the blue people on The Blue Man, including their inability to keep track of time:  13.  Why  would  any one  would have a timepiece?  14.  Also   They can't see in color, they can't go outside  and the air can't be in their eyes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy reading this book.   This book has a lot of flaws and there is not much I can do about that.  The premise of the book is interesting but the execution is poor.  This should be a good book but is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book at all.   The protagonist is a spoiled, egotistical   fool who thinks he's smarter   than others.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent book on the origins of a terrible crime. But it is so bad I cannot recommend it.   I read this book for my first job as a researcher, when I applied for a position in a prestigious journal. The assistant editor was a great interviewer, a good scholar, and a very good writer.  In an interview she asked me, "Do you have any experience with child abuse?   " I thought about it and replied, "Yes, I have a nephew who was molested.  "  She asked me about the research and I told her that I had published a book on it. She looked at me and said, "You know, I really like that book.  But the author has a very bad reputation for using junk science in his books and, I don't know, that has really bothered me.  It's an extremely poor book and the research is bad.  I'm sure it's a great piece of history, but you really have to know where to find good research before you start relying on it."   In her conclusion she points out that the original research on "Franklin and his boys" is a bit of a bust:  The evidence that Franklin was involved in this is weak   It is difficult to judge the importance of the data gathered from such a small group of boys   The data may also be suspect   There are other problems with the research that should have been brought to the attention of the committee.  The book is also very poorly written.  You know it's bad when the author spends most of the time on the first person.  He often gets in the way of what he is trying to do, and it is hard to follow.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had the misfortune to have read the original, limited edition of this book on the Kindle.  It is a great book for history, but not so great for history.   This book will tell the reader about a lot of important events that happened in the early years of the Republic, but the author has little patience with the actual authors of these important documents.  For example, one of the sources is a newspaper article about the Battle of Trafalgar, but even after it is pointed out to her, the author can't get a name right, as if the British or French never mentioned it.  The other source is a law book, but she can't find the citation.  I thought that this was interesting, but probably not worthy of a good history book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first book I read by an old school Renaissance man.   It's not a bad read, but there are some very basic mistakes.  As far as the story goes, it doesn't really happen, except through the eyes of a narrator.  The protagonist has a very shallow understanding of human nature, and a very limited range of motivations for behavior.  This makes me a bit wary, but I think he could be more interesting if he tried harder to understand people, as a result of having lived in a different time and culture.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good read, but it is very uninterested in what we've learned in the past to keep us out of danger.   What has been discovered is a very dangerous method of dealing with things like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book because I was sick of reading the same old boring, self-absorbed novel. It was not bad. It just wasn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first book in the trilogy is, like all fantasy, far too long and full of problems.   It was one of the worst books I've read in a long time.  It seemed like a chore to put all of the characters to a good use, and it was very confusing to me as to where in the story it was headed, and what the plot was.  I felt like I was being told the story with a bunch of fancy words for a name that were in no way related to it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not even worth the time to read, let alone try and understand.   If I ever have the opportunity to try to understand it, I'll fail miserably. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my students did an excellent job of explaining the basics of statistical analysis.   The only bad thing I can say about the book is that it is almost entirely absent of mathematical terms.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought I would like this book better than my other books.   It does a good job of showing how the human mind works.  But at the end of the day it is just too much like another of his books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I thought that the book was good enough to stand on its own and be a worthwhile reading experience, the writing is so amateurish and the narrative so poorly constructed that I can only conclude that a writer who isn't a professional writer was handed the task of attempting a novelization and couldn't quite do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been wanting to try this book for a long time now, and finally got around to it,   and it is terrible    (the author seems to have written the book before there was even a word written about a lesbian relationship)   She should go back to the old days and write about gay marriage 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a classic: it is an excellent, highly recommended treatment of the topic of religious experience from the point of view of the Christian who seeks to experience God's presence in his or her own life. It's not a good book - but it's a damn good one!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know why anyone would give a book like this a negative rating.   A lot of people are just   going through the motions.  If you're a realist you're already   not interested in the story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of factual errors.    It says that the "sophomore year of high school, I found out I was a terrible artist" but doesn't say that the book's cover shows that the person is a terrible painter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book about how bad writing and bad storytelling can corrupt even the best novels and short stories.   There is no real plot or story line here, no tension or tension building up until it's just a huge let down.    All you're left with is a boring narration by someone who can't get out the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a huge fan of the novel itself.  It is quite dull - like some sort of cross between a poorly written comic book and the "Honeymooners"  - and is full of cliches.  I am glad I bought this instead.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've never really understood this book's popularity. It's an interesting read about a group of people who all think they are different but actually aren't. They all have some kind of personal disorder and that's what makes them interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really don't know why it took me so long to pick this up.   It started out ok, then grew on me as I went along.  But then there was the whole plot.  I like that the book is "hardcore" but doesn't just end there.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that made me believe this book was going to be worth reading was the little tidbit about a book entitled "The Way the Wind Blows" by a man named Howard Thurman,   that I found in a book about the famous World War II pilot   (which was also made into a movie),   in which Thurman has a near-death experience that turns out to be a dream and not a hallucination.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a terrible book.   I couldn't believe how terrible it was.  I've read so many bad books.  No matter how many times they're read,   their quality never improves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book I've bought from a library since I stopped reading in high school.   I'm not a big fan of reading fiction by women.  I don't really understand why, but it doesn't feel natural to me.  There are too many stereotypes and clichés in the book that don't gel with me. I don.  For example, the "bachelor", "marshal" and "chauffeur" all sound like the type of people who would hire you to run their errands.  The "puppy" sounds like the only one of the group to be happy, like he has a great life.  Also, I don' t like the "slut" comment.  It's one of those moments where you think to yourself, "how can a guy think that woman would be interested in a guy?  It must be a sign of poor self-esteem."  It takes two to tango 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a shame that this book was published in 1980, the same year as the   I was reading this book   in the library, but   could not understand anything in it.   This book is about a man, in a city on the eve of   civil war, who tries to convince people   to join his team in trying to prevent it. He does   have a "lucky charm,"   but I think that charm is the only thing that will save him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad book is just a terrible collection of stories about terrible people.   In addition, I found most of these stories to be about characters who seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and having the wrong idea about the right thing at the right time (ie:  "The boy goes to school with his best friend, and as a result they make up a story about two bad kids who stole a book from a library and don't return it.") 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book at all. I can't remember why I liked the book at the beginning, but by the end, I just could not stand it.   First off, it's hard to put into words how much I dislike this book.  The main character is very manipulative, and the story is really not a good one.  She has a lot of issues with men, but I didn't like how she used a lot o "bizarre" excuses to justify not having a relationship with a man.  I don't know how her mental state got worse over time, but she seemed a lot more distant and distant from people in the last third of the book. Not to mention, she's a complete bitch towards some of the people she's close to (including a guy who's friends with her) who are upset she didn't end up getting a good man.    It's hard for me to understand how the author thought it was appropriate to include so many "outliers" in her story and to leave it so open ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While not my favorite, there are a few interesting bits in this one, such as:  - the main character is in a coma and has no idea when she will wake up.   - she is very unhappy about having to go to work in the next day.  - when she does go, she is told by her supervisor that the office is full of men. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was good, but not that good, not in my opinion.   I didn't like the story so much as the style.  I'm a graphic novel fan,  so this was pretty cool for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last 5 or so books in the series are good, but not really all that good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a child as part of my daily reading routine, and while it has some nice ideas, the book is very clunky and confusing in places.   This is one of those books that really doesn't stand the test of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a massive failure.   The writing was poor and the characters are a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst part about "This is How You Lose Her" is the ending.   She tries to convince the boy to go with her because they are "brothers".   Well, when you can't even have a little sister to play with you because you don't want her to have a brother, how can you be brothers?   Oh and why do we have to pay for a sibling's funeral   (I read it the first time to show the reader the book is really not about that). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the biggest waste of time I've ever spent on a book.   I could have read all the info about all the diseases that can be contracted by touching a corpse, but it wasn't necessary.  I was told that there are diseases that are so contagious that you can't come into contact with someone who has them, but I'm not one of them.  If there is a disease that is so common that it can be passed from one person to another via touch, I'll be glad to know about it.  The next book I read will be called The Science Of Unattractive People, because I don't care for the first book I've read about that topic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    These books are not about "reality," but are about "realism". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a "first time" reader, a first edition.   When the book was first published in 1963 it was hailed as the "Book of the Century,"   but the book has become almost meaningless,   and the only thing worth mentioning is the author's obituary 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the one book I can't stand.   I have to read it twice just to be sure.  In the first part, they show an interesting technique for manipulating people, the "facial recognition" of others:  I can never remember a face or a name; I remember the expression of the eyes, the size of the lips.  It works, of course: it gives a feeling that you know the other person.  But the second part is the same:  The next morning I had a feeling I'd forgotten a certain event, or someone important.  I remembered it.  Which reminded me that I was being watched,   and why was my heart pounding?  I don't think the book is interesting, but if you want to be a master of manipulating others, this is a good book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a child I read every book in my library and loved them all.   But when I read this one   it felt like I had read   everything that was left out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is too short.   There's just not enough going on in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a typical example of the way in which fantasy authors get things about themselves wrong. The main character, Sorensen, is portrayed in this book as a little naive and easily manipulated, but at the end of the book he has the courage to take charge of himself.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So   I   started   this   in   a   classroom   before   but   was   reading   for   fun   and   enjoyed   it   very   much   -   then   forgot   all   about   the   next   book  .   But  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a bad novel at all. I found it to be a very intelligent and well-researched book about a group of people who have been imprisoned for a long time. The people being discussed are the people who had been in prison with them. The book is about a particular man in a particular situation who manages to talk his way out of prison. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book after a friend and I were discussing a movie that I liked and we couldn't figure out why the character who was always there to save the protagonist (that's us!) didn't want to save herself (we know she was going to be saved, but she doesn't want it).   This book was written for young children, and that's not good enough.      
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, this book is not for me.   It's a boring book full of repetitive phrases that have no meaning at all   And I don't feel like reading the chapters on the "rules of writing" and the "proper language"   Finally, after reading this book I learned that I should never quote from other authors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book.   It was an interesting take on the phenomenon of the self-destructive personality, but it fell short of being entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not good.   The book itself is a failure.   But there is a little twist to the story.  It is an interesting one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I had no intention of reading this book until a friend lent me it.   The cover is pretty and the author seems to have a lot to say about how we live.  I think I'm in love with this book though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I bought a copy of  .   because I was curious about it.   It's not that bad.  A few of the characters sound like they're trying to be funny but can't pull it off, and that's it. The author tries to throw in some wacky dialog to spice things up but it comes off as a bit silly, and the "real" story takes a back seat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the kind of book that makes you sit back and go, "wow."     I just did.   I'm not in any mood for a good book about the human condition. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like the first half of this book.   It starts off well but then gets bogged down in a lot of tedious explanations and the narrator starts talking about how he's never really been to space or the moon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book.   The first half of the book is mostly about the history of the country and how it has progressed, with good and bad points.  The second half is about the present and how we got to where we are.  I don't really like the third half as much.  It's mostly about current affairs, like the upcoming election.  Not that the book isn't interesting -   It does a great job of explaining why things have changed, how it came about and what we can do about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in the way the author presents this book.   The book opens with a couple's first encounter with an elderly widow (who can hardly speak).   She's a sad old widow who can barely manage to feed her old children.  She also has very little to live on.  So the couple gives her a very small allowance.  The first time she sees them she asks, "Is this the money my husband gave me for our wedding day?"    But then, as the novel proceeds, she reveals that the money came from a mysterious benefactor and that she had no idea who it was.  We learn that the old woman is a "spook" - an invisible being that can steal money from the rich and give it to the poor.  Then we get a really good description of her behavior.  This story is so good, I just had to turn it into a parody:    1) The Widow says, "My son has been trying to get the money for months.  He's not very good at it.  I told him to start at the top and go down to the bottom."     2) The old widow, who's the main benefactor, sits in her garden one day while the sons are working.  There are four "spooks" who have been trying for years to get a share of the money from their father.  Each time one comes along and manages to get their share of a pot of money, it disappears right into the wife's garden.  "I can't explain how they get it!"   3)  The old woman has discovered a secret compartment in a safe.  When a pot is stolen, the secret door opens.  All the money that's gone through that door has disappeared.  4)  She takes out a bunch of old currency and puts it in a big sack.  At the bottom of the sack is the big bundle of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I'd rather have the book I bought at the local store by the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has been more than a year since I read A Fine Mess by Daniel Boorstin. I've been searching for a good read of the kind that was so influential on me as a child. As a child, Boorster made a huge impact on my perception of the world. Not just science, but also poetry and literature. A Fine is a good introduction to Boorston's literary style: The characters are good, the dialogue is good. The book is entertaining and interesting. However, Borne's attempt to combine "discovery" and "dismayment" in a story about science and poetry is misguided. The "disillusionment" is the result of the bad science. For example, the book attempts to prove that Borne wrote The Golden Apple by proving that the characters do not believe in the existence of the Holy Grail. The whole book is about that. The characters can't believe that the people they know and respect in the real world are gullible fools. It's a bad premise for a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was written by a person who's never been a good writer.   She has a very specific and specific goal in mind for her book, and in that goal she has a limited amount of time to write it.  She gives a good example of how writing is like working a long shift.  A book is a book.  You can't just sit down and write.  That's the problem with this book.   It's so long, and takes up so much of the day.  It was over after an afternoon.  The only good part was that the author didn't get too lost in her goal and didn't spend too much time in the editing room, but that's just my opinion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of this book is that we are all just walking around in a world full of problems.  The problems seem to be everywhere:  The bad decisions we make  the things we say  the way our minds work   That doesn't mean it isn't possible to change a person's mind   But even if we did   We still have to get to know ourselves   Maybe the solution is in not making choices   So that's the point of this novel:  It doesn't have a good solution 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book so much  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sure I'm not the only one who found The Red: My True Story of the KGB's Secret War in America frustrating:  It was published in 2009.  The Soviet Union and the US were close allies, and so were the Soviets and Americans.   The KGB, as it is generally understood, was a KGB-run "security service,"  while the CIA, as usually understood,  was a CIA-run and -funded "intelligence service."   But in the last third of the book, the author suggests a "strange" alliance in the 1980s between the CIA and the KGB,   to the point where he writes that "the CIA and KGB have been operating in tandem for years."  I didn't buy that.  Both the KGB and the CIA were deeply involved in a criminal and anti-democratic counter-insurgency effort in the USA that is now well documented.  Neither organization was interested in the "American public."  Both were concerned only with "their own narrow interests."  When I was a kid I knew the CIA was involved in drug-running in Central America (and that this is now the subject of a major documentary movie).   Now I know that the KGB has been doing the same thing here for decades.  I don't know if the book's author realized the implications of his thesis.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been meaning to get this book for a long time and finally finally did, but    the   writing   is bad and   too   so   much   of   information   that   it   just   makes   me   want   to   give   up   on   reading  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when it came out.   It took me a long time to get around to it because my interest in psychology has nothing to do with the "dark arts".   However, the book was interesting as well as   educational. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book. It is not for everyone, but it's for everyone I can imagine.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a bad story in this book. The main character is an intelligent but immature man, who is also the most arrogant person in the history of mankind.   The book is about his marriage, but I doubt I would have wanted to marry someone like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the most boring book I've read in a long time.      If you're in it for the book, then this is the perfect book: it's about a guy who takes the world's fastest car from a big corporation to sell to a local mechanic.  But if you're buying a car just to see what it's like to be in a race car, I don't think this is a very good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed   This is my first time reading a book by a self-help author, and I had high hopes for the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to read this book on a whim to see if it would be as good as I expected.  I am a bit disappointed in it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author's idea that a writer's job is to get "the book" to stand up on its own and tell a story was pretty stupid, so she went about it in the most idiotic way imaginable.   The book is basically a collection of short stories about characters who are almost always women, and about what happens to a man when he tries to get with them.  I know women don't get it, but it was really painful to read about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half is really just a set-up for the second.   What are the chances of that happening:  (1)   (2)  (3)  So I guess I'll keep reading these. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad read.   My husband is one of my favorite people (he is smart, funny, a nice guy, loves animals, etc.), and he liked this book.  He thought the characters were great.  But his biggest problem was that the story was too similar to another book he had read in a library.  His issue was that  the main characters (the "furry little creatures") were  similar to the main character of  "The Wicker Man," and  it "came out of left field."   I would not recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It doesn't take long to realise that what you're supposed to be enjoying about a book is the plot.   The plot doesn't develop as much as you might like, so you have to put up with a lot of unnecessary (and rather dull) action, and a rather turgid romance between two men who are supposed to have so much chemistry.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason I didn't like this book was that it had very little to do with the subject.   Instead, it was just an exercise in making a point:  One day I was going to my favorite diner to get my food, and when I got there I realized that the place is always crowded, but I hadn't been noticed.  I went in, looked at the menu, looked over the food, picked out some things I liked, and asked a waiter to help me order.  Unfortunately, the waiter wouldn't help me.  He would give me a list of choices, and I would have to write down what I wanted, then he'd tell me what he thought.  This took a long time, so I asked if he could please put my name down and tell me if anything came out of my order:  He said I wanted a hamburger and fries with a salad.  When he saw the burger, he started telling me it would take 2 hours.  It wouldn't!  So I asked him, "Do you know if you could get something else?"  He responded:  Well, the menu says that the food takes about 15 minutes.  And I asked the server if I could order something else:  And she said she couldn't write that on the menu.  So that's it!    I don't think I would ever go back to this place if I wanted to get food for a while:

Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a while now I've been wanting to get a copy of a book by Peter Kreeft that I've always thought was very good.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't bring myself to get it.  Instead, I bought a paperback copy of the hardcover and I'm sorry to say that it wasn't all that much better.   I do think that Kreefts "The Lost Continent" is a great work,   but if you're looking for a good exploration of a continent that you probably already know the name of, I'd go elsewhere.

For a while I was actually looking forward to reading it,   but once I started, I found the plot a bit tawdry and the characters uninteresting, .   I was never really interested in the characters,  the setting is a bit far fetched,  and   the ending is anticlimactic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a big fan of "literary" novels. This is one of those books that you know it is going to be good because it is so good that it is almost obvious.   But it is a letdown in so many ways. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I got a great deal on this book.   There was a lot in it that was interesting, but after finishing the book I was less impressed.  It's not a bad read by any means, but the writing style is too simplistic and the whole book is more like a collection of anecdotes rather than a serious discussion of the political system. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book about 3 years ago, and it seemed interesting at the time, but the book did not stand up to the hype.   The characters have a very limited range of motivations; the story is almost entirely about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's just about the worst   book   I've ever read   in my life  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so disappointed   This book is a waste of time   It just says   what the author wants to   without even trying  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " This book could've been written for an eleven year old child with a little less skill   and more attitude.   It was a little frustrating how the author felt the need to include a summary of the entire book   in the introduction, but then had to immediately explain   her "new" way of explaining things   when she actually has not   learned a thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this book.    While I loved the story, it didn't capture my imagination like I expected it to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a good read.   I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not already have at least a minimal understanding of human biology. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be both bad and useless.   First off, it is a compilation of articles about "the worst people you can ever meet":   The most egregious "good people" are:  -   (a)   - People who work in the entertainment industry   and   who have   great   careers   but   just   don't   get   it   right  .   People   like   Steven   Rinella   from NBC   can   have   a   career   as   a . reporter   if   they   want   to   keep   things   simple  , but . they   still   know   too   much   about   everything   that   matters   in   their   lives  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish it had more focus, as the characters seem to drift around in a "one way" way.   For example, in the beginning they are going to a party at a fancy house, but the party is ruined by an idiot who just doesn't know how to behave, so he just starts yelling at the partygoers.  They have to get him out of there so they can get to the party, but this idiot shows up in the most dramatic way possible and it's not very entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book a good review based on the premise and first chapter.  It was interesting to learn that the U.S. government has classified its own information.   It is very likely that this information was kept secret to protect the U.S. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was published in 1983.   It is a very good book, but I am not sure I will ever be able to understand all its technical jargon.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A good book: a good story: a better way of writing a good book"
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of this book is a tedious, dull and over-long account of the development of the theory of a theory of consciousness from Plato to Descartes to Bergson.   This is only partly accurate because Bergson (Bergson's students) was a student of Descarte who was a great admirer of Des Cartes' idea that the mind and body are really two separate and independent things.  The point is that in the later theory that is Bergson's, the mind is not separate from the body.  After all, Descartesian philosophers like Bergson argued that the brain is a separate organ which has a physical cause.  This idea has been taken over by various philosophers who argue that the same thing could happen to our body and brain.  But the brain's relationship to the mind (or soul, as some like to call it) has always been a question which can be addressed only by the study of physical science.  I would have liked to see more about what Bergson really thought about his own theory.  For example, he makes the point that it is not a new view but a continuation of DesCartes' view (in which the brain and body form one unified whole) but he fails to explain why Descartais is not the greatest influence on Bergson and the reason why his theory has had such a limited influence on modern psychology.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to have a new copy of this book that I almost didn't finish it.   First of all, a) it's not even about   anything that's not   important in this world, and   b) there's no way it can be made more interesting by me making this up.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read several books by Mr. Roth's that I did not like.   This one was no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a travesty of good writing, it is a waste of the author's time, and it is far too long.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a disappointment.   I have never read a book so filled with inaccuracies and un-factuals, so   devoid of historical and scientific accuracy.  And,   the main characters   who   are so  (or should  ) be discredited are  (a)  incompetent   (b)  fictional    and  (c)  unreliable   as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last 30 pages of the book consist of a number of "experts" being interviewed about the future of the industry.   They are very smart people, but their opinion of future technology is very "not today" in my opinion.  It seems the people in the future are going to be so smart that they don't have to use calculators. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read many of the 'good' books by Robert Pirsig and David Eggers, but this one was not very good.       There were some really good moments, such as when the two characters (the one who has to have the child and the one who is responsible for raising it) are talking.  The 'bad' parts were when he described the child as the 'child of the state,'   while the other character, the 'parents' tried to explain what a good parent he was  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad.   The author does a pretty good job at writing about the history of America's relations with Israel; it's really about the way the Middle East has been influenced by the Cold War.  But the book is a total disaster.  In fact, it was so bad that I almost gave up reading it when I started.  (In fact, I'm sure the book's author feels bad about this, because the book never would have been published were it not for the Clinton administration's support for the State of Israel.)   But, of course, the problem isn't that the book isn't bad enough.  The problem is that it is so wrong that I cannot help but agree with the reviewer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is quite long, but there are a lot of interesting and fun facts and anecdotes in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book did not impress me.   It's about a "sociopathic narcissist" that  makes "disservice" (dishonesty and failure) a habit:  He starts off as a good friend to the lead characters: he is  unbiased  witty   about   his   professional   affiliations   he is a good  friend to his  partners   when he gets angry he can be   violent   (he's a "psychopathic   narcissist  ")   but he doesn't act on   these   tendencies   until   it is   too late   and   I felt   like he was   acting   as   a  "narcissistic   monster   "  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is not bad.   However, it has no plot.  Not interesting enough.  It is a waste of space.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This is a pretty terrible book. "   The whole premise of this book is that a child, who is the heir of a large fortune, has gone missing and his father is trying to find him.   (Although, the author is quick to point out that it's not exactly like the real-life tale.  The boy was not a famous artist but a "poor boy from a poor family.")   This book is about a whole family of rich children, who are only rich because they never work hard, and they always get what they want:      That is the theme of all of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the book on a whim, on my way to a book fair, and it turned out to be a pretty poor decision.   The only reason I'm even reviewing it is that I wanted to know if it was worth the money, because I knew I'd be making a few bucks on the paperback. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It has a good plot and good characters.  It's a bit short though.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When the good book is "the right book", then you are doing something wrong, not "the best book". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has all the makings of a classic; however it is not a classic.    This is one of those books that people say they don't like, but then they think they like it when they think about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most uncharacteristic thing about this book is the fact that it appears to have been written by an eleven year old, for eleven year olds.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was very interesting that this is a sequel of a previous book, but this one was a bit different.  It's set during WWII, so it's more realistic and in many ways more interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very weak book.   It is full of technicalities that make it difficult to follow, and the author is very sloppy in his writing.  There is a whole chapter devoted to a small number of random questions, which I found extremely boring.  For a book about the history of radio, the author seems to think that the question "is there a connection between telephone and television?"  No.  It has nothing to do with it.  I have to look this up on the net. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book is a bit tedious, and I felt that it was a bit overlong. But then the second half took a turn that made me laugh out loud.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's terrible.   The author is writing to a white audience, not black people.  For some reason he decided to use a fictional black man as a foil for a white hero.  A terrible way to go about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to like this book but I was underwhelmed.   It is mostly about a man named John who wants to leave a bad marriage and is having a hard time doing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be a waste of time, and really a waste to read.  The story of the book is good, but the actual characters are so one-dimensional that I couldn't even be interested in their story.   The main character is described as "a typical kid with a very weird imagination",  but  he's not really  anything like  typical  kids  like  the rest of my family.  He's a  stereotypical  geek  who's very sensitive to criticism.  This character is  extremely annoying  and annoying people in general.  It's almost funny to watch people try to fight him, and then get bored and give up.  Overall,  I felt  that  the book was a waste 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want a good read about what it's like to be an atheist in the 21st century,   you shouldn't   bother   reading  .   The only thing that     makes this   interesting is   it   doesn't 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book.   I found it to be a very good read, but there were a lot of inaccuracies in the story which I would have appreciated.  There were three instances when it felt like the story was trying to explain something which did not need to be explained in a book. Firstly, the narrator tells us that the first man on the Moon, Eugene Cernan, never made it off the lunar surface.  The first person to walk on the moon, Neil Armstrong, did not do so until after the first lunar landing.  That's not to say that Apollo was a failure - it was successful but it wasn't perfect.  As far as landing a vehicle on the surface of the moon - there are many theories as to why this didn't happen.  We have all heard about the Apollo 1 fire which started when it came in contact with the ground.  Some have said that it was put out by a spark which was not there.  Others claim it was because a helium line got cut.  I didn't like these theories but did like the way the narrator made them up.  It was a way of giving a "scientific explanation" which, I found, wasn't scientific.  Next I found out that Cern the first person on the lunar landing - was actually the third person.  And while Eugene C ernan was certainly the first human to step foot on the Lunar surface - he was not the first astronaut to do so.  This is another example of poor research.  So we have one astronaut who was the first to walk onto the Moon - but not the second.  Third, in Apollo 14 the first crew to land on the moons surface did not survive the landing. I know this is in the book and it's not something that is meant to be false - but there are several inaccuracies about this.  Of course the book doesn't say that.  Another one is that Apollo 13 was the only time a lunar module exploded.  All of the Apollo missions had to end with the loss of one of the astronauts - which is why you have to have two of them.  A little more research would have been nice but I was expecting something better than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most glaring flaw in this book is that it is a "what if" kind of book.   Suppose that every day were a bad day.  Suppose every bad thing that happens was an accident (but why would a good, intelligent, goodhearted person intentionally set out to do a bad thing?).  Suppose the most important day of my life was the day I got that letter, and I'm still alive.  This book gives you a lot of reasons not to get that letter and the ones it does give you are pretty much useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really expecting a good book, but it really just seemed like the author was playing to the crowd with this one, which is a shame because the book was about a real life event (the death of her father).   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My most recent trip to the library was to the collection of short stories by Thomas Wolfe.   The stories   I   are:  "The Great Train Robbery"   " The Moon Is Down" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book.    It is a very well written story about a woman who goes to a very unpleasant job with a very bad boss and is the only good person in the office. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story about this book is terrible.   It is a collection of short stories   all written   by a man who claims   he had a psychotic break at age 16 after spending four years   in a mental institution   when he was accused of being a pederast (in his defense he had been a young homosexual at the time).   While in a state of deep psychosis he claims to have been transported   to the past by his mother   who had committed him to the institution  to stop him from molesting children.    While in the hospital    the old folks had to bring him   food so he would not have to starve   and he got a job   as a janitor at a local motel   which he seems to have liked a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my experience, there's no substitute for being in the presence of a good writer:  It's like looking at a beautiful painting for the first time:  I was instantly captivated by the first few panels of "The Art of Racing in the Rain."  It has a great sense of place, a great story, and an   sense of how people get into all sorts   problems when they're young and inexperienced.  It just   works, and   will resonate with readers of any age.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is difficult to read a book when it takes on such an anti-religious bent. The "Bible" has never been my cup of tea, but a lot of it is true, and the "Bias" section is an embarrassing effort.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's about the end of World War II, which the German people lost. I was hoping for more about what happened afterwards. This book is basically a collection of war diaries.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it isn't so bad that I have to re-read it several times to finish it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is weak, the characters are one-dimensional (especially when it comes to the main female protagonist), and the ending is very disappointing  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a good time reading this book - but there's a lot of "I don't know" in the story.   The main character is portrayed as being very bright but very stupid - which is a bit weird since he's a genius who has solved the problems of hundreds of people over the years    Also, he's very good at inventing and selling ideas, and he is a brilliant inventor  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book. It has a lot of great info on the subject.    However, most of the information is pretty shallow.  I've never really had any need for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason I didn't like this book as much as the others is the author is a little too self-promoting in the book - as if she has a right to make a living as a writer.   She also has a habit of using too much exclamation marks - especially when she's describing something that makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be an interesting story about a man who tries to be a decent person but ends up falling for a criminal.   This book really is about a person with a bad life who tries everything he can to be better but eventually learns that he is not very good at doing good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most compelling book I've read so far.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a little depressing that this book is such a disaster. I would have been very pleased with the outcome of the "study" on which the book is based. The main conclusion that this "study," made up of a couple of hundred participants, draws is that people who use pornography are not only more likely to be diagnosed with an erectile disorder, but also are more likely than those who do not use it to be depressed, to feel guilty, and to feel like they're in the wrong sex.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a nice guy and is so knowledgeable about the military but I didn't think he'd understand that it's not about the soldiers in the war but about the war itself.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry to say that this was a pretty poor book.   There are some good things about it,   but it's got some serious problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a girl who goes to her grandfather's house for Christmas, and meets a strange man:  What does this strange man want?  He doesn't say.  But he does seem to be quite capable of reading minds.  I don't know why he was there at all.   He didn't seem to need anything, and there wasn't a sign on the door that said so.  And when the grandfather says, "You don't need a gift," he gives her a book she's never heard of and an odd looking glass that glows in the dark.  Why did he want her a gift?     He didn the first time.  He's not supposed to come back, but he did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a huge disappointment for anyone who was planning on reading the classic 'The Wizard of Oz'.   There is so much wrong with it that the book doesn't even qualify as a disappointment.   The main character is a spoiled, self-centered, and completely unlikable spoiled kid who has nothing better to do than annoy his friends.  There's a great deal of 'Oz' and 'Wizard of Oz' in this book.  I'm not just talking about the characters or the plot, but also the overall theme and the writing style.  If you want to hear about a classic fantasy book from the 80's, then this is a good choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disaster   The book suffers from:  1.    I had to do this on the spot after a year   but the book is really terrible   the book has a lot of good things   and   2.      No author would ever say that   "I'm glad I didn't write that book."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very badly written book.  It is filled with lots of confusing references and many of the images and stories do not even make sense to me.   A lot of the imagery is very hard to make out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The bad parts were the poor pacing, the fact that it was a book about a time when people didn't trust women and that the people were also crazy (in a bad way) to think that they could be trusted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is so lame it would have made for a great movie (if they had done a decent job of it, anyway).
