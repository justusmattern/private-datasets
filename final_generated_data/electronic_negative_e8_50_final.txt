I have had an   Sennheiser HD650  ,   AKG K550   and   Fostex T50RP   in the past.  I   have   always   found   a   problem   with   them   (although   most   of   it   is   the   soundcard).

So   i   picked   up   one   from   local   electronics   store   because   he   sounded   good.  But   soon   realized   no   difference   between   his   new   or  old   speakers  .

So, now it's time to start using it.   Then, just when I start using the device, I'm hit with an error message.  It turns out that this particular iPad can't display any image that isn't native to the iPad (in this case, a video clip from a movie).   Even worse, my iPad is just now getting around to being updated to iOS 7.  This is going to be a real bummer for a lot of us that depend on video clips as our main source for video entertainment.

If I get a virus on it I have to call the company to get the software removed from the hard drive and that usually takes a few days.  In the meantime I have had to turn my computer off every time I change something on the network.  This really should have been replaced with a more reliable computer

I purchased this because I wanted to have a portable music device that would allow me to listen to any kind of music I wanted.

It's easy to use, but the screen is very small and sometimes the controls don't work well.  Other times the screen doesn't have any functionality, like it can't play a video that I've already watched on my iPad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the 1990s, I owned an Intex Portable hard disk drive and was delighted with it.   It was cheap and worked perfectly in Windows 95.  For some years, I had used my Macintosh with the Intex as a spare disk drive in a PC for various types of files.  But then I discovered that the Intec was a lot slower and, for some reason, was a bit flaky in a network setting (it would hang at startup time).   So, I bought the Palm OS PC for it. I tried it in the Palm for a while but found it to be a poor choice.  Now I have two Intex systems in my collection.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    While this is a nice piece of equipment it is a terrible replacement for my previous   modular audio interface (which was also an   bad   product).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a wireless mouse to replace an old wireless one I had.   After getting it up and running, I found that the buttons had been moved from the bottom to the top of the mouse, where the mouse pad's surface would be.  (The previous wireless mouse's buttons were on the bottom.)        The bottom buttons also made it difficult to use the mouse with the palm of my hand.  It is a wireless, battery operated mouse.  I love that it has USB and power cables (and is really small).   But the fact that it's battery powered also means that it requires constant attention - even if you are using the mouse only occasionally.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A couple of years ago I bought the N-Fi. It was one of the first of these systems I'd ever seen, and it was a beautiful thing. It has three different speaker options:  One is the good old Bose Soundbar system, which has always been my favourite sound for music.   For some reason, the Bose soundbar has an odd subwoofer.  It's pretty bad.  For the last two years, it's been pretty terrible to listen to music. It gets noticeably tinny with classical music and even more so with pop music. The speaker quality is pretty good for the money, though, so I can't really complain.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this amp a month ago, and I haven't been happy with it.    First, the volume is very high, as high as I need to make music, and it doesn't allow me to listen at normal volumes.  The next problem is that it can't be turned off.  I put the amp on a USB drive, so I can listen to it over my   speakers, but it won't turn off. It will only turn on and off when a program is running.  This is the first time I've purchased anything from  Sony  and I'm not happy with my purchase.

It tracks the boat, and lets you know which direction the wind is blowing in.  The "digital compass" is so poorly made that it's useless on a sailboat.  My "digital" compass does this, but my car's does not.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm not sure how I lost my copy of the new DVD edition of this excellent documentary about a controversial and well-known medical procedure:  It's a long review, and the discussion is good, but I can't shake a bad feeling about it:  One of the main arguments against a caesarean is that the baby is a bit less "natural" than the mother.  This is one of the rare "new" techniques for preventing "bruises and scars," but it's not the way they've been doing it since at least the middle of the 20th century.  One woman who had a C-section on her 5th month of pregnancy had a "perfect" baby.  They cut up the baby's spleen and let the baby bleed to death from the back...then stitched up her wounds with duct tape.  I just wish they'd come up with a better, more sensible way to do it.

I could read all the books I already have printed on my iPad, and the eBook is just a PDF file that takes forever to download.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my son to use as a personal digital camera (I'm old enough to remember my own digital cameras from before the    first cell phone).   It took a long time to figure out how to use it as a camera:  This is a very good product but it's   very hard to put in your pocket.   My son is 6 years old and a very small person, so   he really can't   use it in his pocket. So far   we've tried a number of methods of   securing it to a bag or   backpack.  It really   seems like something a professional would use but   it's still very awkward to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a used Mac mini this past summer.   The first week I was using it, it would randomly get a "no video" error.  But, at least it had a DVD burner (I use the iDVD for my DVDs).   As the week went on and the system kept getting the error, I finally decided that I had better replace it.  My friend tried it, but he couldn't get the error to go away.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For those of you who like to talk about things that need improvement:  This device is a joke.   The design is so bad it looks like something from an 8-bit video game.  It's not even the audio output that is the problem.  The audio is the same as the one my computer uses.  I tried connecting to the audio adapter that came with the device, but it only works when the video card is plugged in.  In addition, the computer is already hooked up to a TV with a built-in sound system.  When I plugged the device in it produced the sound from the TV.  Not impressed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price of the product itself is pretty reasonable for what it is:  It's not a bad computer in itself.  It takes a lot to get a good laptop (i.e. not very nice) to be better than a brand new one:  Unfortunately, the lack of a full-size disk drive and DVD drive makes it less useful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had to return my first laptop   because it kept freezing  . I used the computer in a couple of different situations.   In the first case, a friend's son is going to be studying the   subject of computer security.  For some reason   the student didn't want to use   Linux   which   can be a pain in the  hand   (though I can see that   someone   who   is only interested in   learning   security could   use it  ).   The second   situation   was I was going to go on a business trip to Brazil.   One of the reasons   why I was   considering it   was because   all   of   my   office equipment   worked   well   on   ubuntu   but   they   don't   have   USB   slots   like   Windows   users   do

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got one of these when they first released it.   It's a decent mic for the price.  I've used it for everything from recording my voice to recording my guitar.  It takes great quality recordings to get the full quality sound you want.  However,  I found the only quality that makes it worthwhile is when the mic is not moving.  Even  when recording my phone calls,  there's no sound when talking to someone.  The price isn't a bargain by any means but I find the quality very acceptable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the second time I purchased these cables from an online vendor.   The first one I received from them was defective in several ways:  First, the cable is too small.  It takes up the entire length of my computer (32 inches)  (or, as I like to say, "half a monitor"   - the width is about half an inch less)   Second, the wires on both ends are too long.  They just hang down, so they are not functional at all.  Third, they are so flimsy they're almost unusable.    (The good:  When I use a cable tester ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3QSVE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 ) I can tell  that there are at least five strands broken or twisted in the middle,   but I suspect there might be several others.

I   purchased a     device     called   the   Panasonic  .   but   it   is   very   slow   and   hard   to   use.  My   camera  is   built   using   Sony   type   electronic   hardware.  It   also   supports   external   SD   memory   and   can   play   video   from   any   source .  If   you   want   everything   at   one   price   then   this   will   save   your   money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The original model I bought was just a good, inexpensive way to get a TV to display a picture in a way that wasn't too distracting.   I used to work at a TV store and the TV stores kept trying to sell me a TV that would use a CRT and would be a lot more powerful   when it needed to.  The first TV I bought had to be returned because it wouldn't work, but the replacement worked fine   Eventually, I got the same model and it wasn't as good as the original one (I'm not a TV expert), but it's still better than using an external monitor
