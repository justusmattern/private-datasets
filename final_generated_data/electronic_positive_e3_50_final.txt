Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this item for my Sony e-5100 DSLR camera.   First off,   It is not waterproof but it was nice to have the option in my case.  As expected,  the quality of the lens and the aperture ring are not what  I had hoped it would be.  It does make a difference when shooting video,  but    When   shooting still photos,  it   is not as noticeable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently bought a TRS cable, to plug a PC to a TV. It came with 3 cables, but I wanted 3.5mm, as is used on TV sets. When I got my cable, I noticed that there were 3.75mm plugs (which I could not fit to my PC, but it would accept them, though it would not connect them). So, I bought 3.3mm plugs. It is very simple, although there is some fiddling to get the two pins right on the same plug. I tried 2.5 mm on both ends, with great success, but 3.0mm is a pain, though the cables don't seem to be too long, and so I just tried them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a young man, it was a very good device for playing sound tapes back on my old record player.   I recently purchased another portable cassette deck, this time an older model.  I thought it was going to be an upgrade to my older one (the new one is much bigger and is really good for the price), but it has been disappointing.  No good audio quality.  The player is light, but the sound is not.  Also, the deck can't play standard sized cassettes.  That means the card slots have to be enlarged to fit standard sized cards.  Not worth the price I paid for the new unit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As you know the main source of the high noise on this unit is its very noisy speakers.   I had to put a noise cancelling dac in it to get the sub to work.  It sounded pretty good to my ears with the sub set to the max gain, and also a little muffled.  As far as the noise canceling goes,   it works!   With my dac set to max,  it still had some noise in the bass range but it was much better than the original sound.  Also,  if you dont want the noise,  you can remove the noise canceler dac for an all analog sound.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the "Power Plus" Power supply for the HP printer because it is small and does not plug in the printer's power cable.   The Power Plus has a large output transformer that comes on the back of the unit to give you power for the printer.  While it can be difficult to connect to the printer you are using (the printer can run off of the power supply, but it does require some soldering)   You can also connect an AC/DC adapter, power strip and other devices, such as a digital camera   Another plus to this power supply is that you can remove the black plastic cover and attach the transformer on the other side so that you don't have to do any soldering.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So here is a big step up from the Sony, and I am not a fan of the screen. The picture is much better than the Sony's, however there are still some issues. First is that the screen is really a bit too small to use with the supplied light stand. I have no idea why the Sony could not have provided an adapter for this, but in general it is a bit of a waste of money. Second is that there is a slight "squish" when holding the monitor to the TV.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The original XB950 came with a cheap 2.1 amp soundcard and a built-in CD changer. It was horrible - the audio was muffled and a bit distorted. The first XB9x0 I received had the same flaw, but had an 8-track player instead. Since the XB900 and XB930 came with an excellent soundcard/CD player combo, I wasn't too worried about my old one's shortcomings.   I am pleasantly surprised that the new XB990x0 is now better than the original.

We had to use a dial-up modem that we purchased from the grocery store for $10.  With the T4i, we can download the "Full HD" videos we purchased, which are just like HD movies in terms of audio and video.  In addition, the T5 is the only device I would use in the future if I wanted to rent movies from Vudu.

I have a very low profile device with the antenna at one end and a ground rod that runs through the side and bottom of the device and the metal housing of the power cable is exposed to the ground rod.  When I installed my antenna, there was a little wobble with the unit.  After getting it in place, the antenna and the power cord both ran fine.  The only other thing I noticed is that the adapter cable is not the same length as the power supply cable.

I do a lot of writing for a web site ( http://www.digitalwriting.com/articles/computer/smart_warrants.shtml )   and I find it easy to do.  I use a Wacom Bamboo Tablet with the pen attached on a keyboard dock on my computer.  My only complaint is the fact that the Wacomi Bamboo pen is not a USB-powered tablet.  The pen charges while the USB port is disconnected, so if I use it for writing, then I have to charge the pen back up each time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The X-Pro2 is a huge step up in terms of features from my previous camera, the X-T10.   In my opinion, the biggest improvement in the XPro2's design is the way it handles macro photography.  The ability to use the camera with the XF lens is great,   but I really like that I can use it with a wide angle lens,  in other words, the ability to take pictures of a human head.  When I bought my first X-series camera, I was excited about the XA,  but when the camera didn't perform well with the wide angle lenses I had,  I ended up returning the camera and buying an XPro instead.  This is great because  my XA can't do any macro photography without the wide lens, so I can take pictures that would be impossible to take with an XA.  I'm also very pleased with the built in flash.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using the wireless controller for over a year now.   It's not wireless, but it's not very powerful, either.  It is great for quick searches though.  I used it to find the right position for my remote.  The battery life is pretty good.  But the controller is a pain in the butt to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my   iFi HiFi.   In a couple months, I am getting   a new   computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using my new Asus S4 since it arrived last week.   Its quite nice - no loud noises while I type.  It has nice touch sensitive keys, and it has the ability to play most formats well.  The one thing that really annoyed me is that my phone and tablet are about the same size - I use a mini tablet with a stylus for my laptop.  So, when I use my tablet, it is difficult to reach the back buttons on the computer.  However, the keyboard does come in handy when typing very small text on a laptop that is not very portable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using a cheap old laptop for my Linux computer for a few years now.   It is easy to set up and works as expected.  The main issue I've had is when the battery gets low on the battery and the screen turns off.  That means I can't get to my Linux programs or browse the Internet.  A nice product for a reasonable price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought two of these in October for a new printer that would not print from a printer card. They came with a single disk, which was too much to use.   After downloading the printer card, the software and drivers worked perfectly   and   for the first month, then one of the two didn't work. It only worked intermittently and then completely died (which I replaced it with a new one)   so I was not surprised when I got the second one. I was also not surprised at all that they were completely useless when printing to the card.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the M-Audio BX7 digital multi-effects processor for my live sound rig last year as I needed a good mixer for the gig.   The BX has a few features that make it stand out from most digital effects:  1. It has multiple output channels 2. It supports plug-in software.  3. It features 16 effect tracks  (2 x EQ)   So my next task was to figure out how to set up the BX to be a digital mixer (without plug-ins) without having a computer in the room with me.  I used to work with software and that was a nightmare to get just the right plug-outs and effects I needed.  My only problem was that I could only use 1 track at a time.  To resolve this problem I got the MXR M-70 digital multi effect processor for a Christmas present.  With the M70 I can set up to 5 FX, 2 compressors, 2 EQ's, 1 parametric equalizer, 1 reverb and 1 stereo effect.  The M-68's controls are not that great for what you need.  As I got into using software I have realized the value of the Bx.  For all of the digital gear out there I'm really glad I purchased it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used this as a replacement for my previous digital recorder.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the Epson WorkForce V700 in October, 2007, just a couple of months after the Sony DSC-H1, and I'm very impressed. I can't get away from that stupid plastic mount, and there's a big problem with that:  This unit has a built-in battery which works fine (I've had a bunch of batteries, and this one is the best quality, but it does come with a little battery holder that attaches with a small bit of tape that doesn't work well with the battery).   So I get the battery holder and put a new battery in, but I can never get it to power up.   The battery has a little plastic cap to cover the metal contacts in the battery, which seems like a good idea, but the contacts are plastic, so they don't come loose very easily, and the cap isn't the right shape to fit over them.  I have seen these units all over the place, but they don the Energizer and they are cheap ($15) as well.

Now I have to make sure I use the cardreader every time I use a camera that takes an SD card.   This is great for a first electronic device.

My PC has two monitors, one is a standard monitor which is great for playing games but not ideal for video editing, and the other is an LCD monitor which i'm still trying to find the best way to use, because it can be a bit dim, and not ideal if I want to use this in dark spaces like a coffee shop or a library.

I can record audio from many sources with the included USB microphone, and play back music files or play games from a USB stick.      One thing that is a bit annoying is the fact that the record button on the side is hidden under the tape deck.  While I'm not going to use the recorder as a standalone device, it's a bit disappointing that it lacks a headphone jack.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In a nutshell:  The device  (not a computer)   has a pretty cool feature:  In addition to the standard on-off-on-off   function, the  (NOT a computer, but a   cell phone)  comes with a  (cell phone) that can store up to four files (or pictures)  (and can store all this  for up to 24 hours.)   A handy feature, especially   on an  (computer) that's running out of space.   There's a few  (small) drawbacks:  1.  The battery life is pretty  (long term)  long.  If   you use it  (on a regular basis)  every  day,  you'll likely be  (looking at you,   Bill Gates and   Steve Jobs)  using it up long before it goes dead.  I mean,  (even with the 4 gigs)  all you could play was "Wonders."   2.  You can't use it when it's  (unreliable.)  While  (in my opinion)  the phone works great with  (the tablet) (and the computer),   the  device  doesn't.  (I'm going to have to find a  new   device)  3.  It's a bit pricey.  $180 for  the device?       The best part:  It  (a computer) is so cheap (at least compared to the   iPad)  that it's a steal.  And because  (its software is free and open source)  you can even  (do something that a  real computer can't)  run Linux on it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very nice set of earphones that you can enjoy for years.   The quality of the drivers is excellent.  They sound pretty much exactly as described, with lots of detail and punch.  The soundstage is deep, but I am not sure it is as good as some high end monitors.  I did find that the bass wasn't very impressive, but these are very inexpensive and should be capable of great performance.  You can buy better-sounding earphones online, but you can't beat the price here.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing you notice about the HifiBerry is the design.  It feels very sturdy, almost like something from a military lab.   The buttons are on a slightly raised, curved surface,  so you can reach all parts of the unit easily.  The unit comes with a few adapters that allow you to wire in the HWiBerry to a bluetooth device,  including my iPad 3 and a Nintendo DS.  As far as Bluetooth adapters go, it seems very well made.  All the buttons work and  the unit even plays MP3s.  After using the HFiBerry for a couple days,  it has become my go-to music player.  If I'm at home,  I plug the HFM into my television and have it turn on with a "pop" sound.  At my desk,  the HFIB is on and connected to my laptop via bluetooth.  I have my Apple  iMac   with a blu-ray player and   I can easily switch between the two.  For anyone who wants a high quality speaker that won't break the bank,   check out the HfiBerry!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In my humble opinion, this is the most useful thing I've purchased for home and portable use. I use a GPS on my phone, a portable GPS in my car, a handheld GPS at times when I'm out of the house (such as camping or hiking), and a GPS that works when I am home, but I also use it to keep track of a lot of other things - a few hundred dollars worth, but well worth it.   The first time I plugged this GPS in was a disaster.  While it's good enough to be used as a "back-up" for your GPS, it's very much useless without your phone and when you're out of signal.  Now, this isn't a bad GPS by any means - I haven't found anything wrong with it, it just doesn't do what I need it to do and I'm glad I bought the "older" model.  I do feel a little guilty, though - I can't think of a reason anyone would pay twice the price of this GPS if they didn't need it.

My husband and I have a TV at home and we do not have a set up for remote control.  We use the remote to turn the TV on and off.  When you use it to change channels, it does not work very well.  It doesn't recognize the channel number but it tries anyway.  The antenna works very well but the channel numbers do not work at all.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had my PDP-11/15/24/32/64 since they were introduced in the mid 1980s.   The PDP/D is an excellent little piece of work, but it's not the only good little work that's come out in my lifetime.  The new Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) from Steinberg is pretty darn good.  It is not a very powerful piece of gear.  I get about a half watt from it, which is decent.  (I can do with a little more power than that, though.)   It has a full complement of input/output jacks, and it has a 24 bit/192 kHz capability (that is, it can do 192 kHz recording for a CD).   However, the thing doesn't work very well.  For me, it only takes one input to record at a time.  That's it.  There's no way to mix and record at the same time. For a program like ProTools, where the entire sound is mixed in real time, that's fine.  But for someone who just wants to record a song, that limits what one can do.  This is a shame, because it's an incredibly cheap piece of kit.  If you're thinking of buying one, get a better digital recorder.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Just bought the new Aeon M1.   This is an excellent piece of equipment that really does what I needed it to do.  I used a very nice set of F-5B transistors in the old unit and this model is much better   I'm using a 9V power supply so that my power supply isn't an F-1. I will probably buy the new model and upgrade the unit with better transistors

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was a great purchase:  I was looking for something to monitor my dog and keep him from sleeping in his bed for the rest of the night, but didn't want a giant tube of tape or a large electronic device that might break down.   I found this very nice:  It is fairly easy to set up.  It can be adjusted to give you the best view you need.  My dog sleeps on a chair, and this worked just fine.  There is no way he will be tempted to sleep on a desk or armoire either.  This is very similar to the monitor I had for my dog, but much cheaper, and it has a higher contrast.

I listened to a couple hours of recordings on my   PC  , and didn't really like what I heard.  But I figured I'd just wait until I heard it on my iPhone and that would solve my problem.  As it turns out, my iPhone's built in headphone jack was the only way   to get the HD 588 out.  I just plug it into a powered USB port (I use an iPhone adapter to use in Mac) and it works great.  The HD 528 is very good   at the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is really cool. I purchased it at Walmart so I have some idea of what to expect.   It looks like a little piece of art.  As a hobbyist/maker/designer,   this   thing   is   everything   I  imagined.  It has the ability   to connect a computer to   your television   so you can play games remotely   or you can send text messages   while watching tv.  I used this  to transfer my files to a laptop    for my project.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using this keyboard for about 3 months now.   First of all, I love the keyboard.  It has a nice smooth feeling.  The buttons are very responsive.  When you first use this keyboard, it's a little stiff, but as time goes by, it gets easier.  I love using the built in macros.  Another bonus, is the LED light.  My computer comes with 3 different blue lights but this one lights up, when i press a key.  Other than that, i really like this keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the most interesting and useful features of a   digital watch is that the watch can be used to calculate the difference between two or more different amounts.   A few years ago   I bought a digital watch that came with a "real" calculator but with a much more complicated interface.  I couldn't figure out which option was correct in my example and decided to just use the watch.  While doing a calculation the watch gave me a correction to the amount being subtracted, as well as the difference to be added on to the final result.  It also displayed the time the calculation took and how much time passed.  The watch is a neat idea, but there are some problems.  First, you must be willing to download a large number of different programs into your watch. Second, you will have to keep track of each calculator you have downloaded.  There is also no real built in calculator.  (Though there is one that runs on a computer that may be used with the watch.)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the price I didn't expect much out of it.   It's a good looking little unit that gets the job done.  The buttons are responsive and I don't have to reach for the mouse to open the menus.  For those of you who have tried the older model of the mouse -   The old mouse is very slick and makes it easy to get on and off.  It has a scroll wheel that is smooth and not stiff like some mice.  I do wish that it came with a rubber or plastic pad to use for a hand grip on my desk when I'm using a desktop computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very pleased with this product.   I did some research on how much memory is available and found that most devices only have up to 16MB of memory (I'm using an HP laptop with a 6MB memory).   Then, after researching some more, I found out that this device has 8MB (not 8MB) of memory and that can expand by a lot.  I was afraid that I might be missing something when I was researching but I'm very happy to have found this thing.

The Bluetooth interface has been very good.  I purchased a set of bluetooth headphones (a few more dollars) to use when my car is not running.  It is so convenient and has made my car run smoother.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just purchased this and it worked as expected, great for watching TV and movies.   It does not get too hot when it's playing a DVD, but its great for when I want to enjoy a movie on a nice sofa (or couch I might add) without having to carry a big dvd player around.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After all the hype and promises, the Bose Sound Link Pro was worth the hype. It is really easy to use. You do not have to memorize any long passwords or complex login patterns.   Sound Link can automatically stream music from various sources from a Bluetooth keyboard or tablet into your car audio system (using your smartphone) and then stream audio from that into the car speakers.  I was able to stream music off my phone to my speakers with almost no delay.  This is a very neat idea that would appeal to a lot of people.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This device is perfect for my first project. The instruction book is a bit hard to follow but once you figure it out it is really simple.   The instructions say to use a 5/16 drill bit for the hole.  This is not true, I found this to be a better method   I used a 5 1/2 mm hole bit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was thinking about a similar piece of equipment but was told to go get it, so I picked it up on a quick Saturday trip. The thing is a lot smaller than it says, but is very heavy when you're working on it.    The best thing about it is that it's self-contained and you don't need any type of connection or extension cords.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As with other high-quality audio amplifiers, the W7X is very quiet. It's not a high-gain sounder (that has to be run down by an op amp), but it's quiet enough that you can't hear the internal hum from it.   The input is also very noisy--the signal is so weak that it's practically inaudible--but at least you can feel it on your input device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received this as a gift for my husband.   His computer is very old and   the new monitor gives a good   improvement   but   my wife's   computer was destroyed by   her   mother who   took it to the Apple store   in their mall.

The unit works well with my Apple iPhone 5  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works very well for a simple purpose; it is just about the only good electronic gadget I have, because my last electronic device was so bad:  It did not work properly, it was so hard to use and I had no idea why it was not working properly.   This device does everything that my last device did not do:  1) Works as advertised:  Yes, it is difficult to use.  But I can do a lot of things, such as make phone calls, send email and check the weather.  Yes!  2) It's cheap:  This is one of those gadgets that you can find in the "eBay" for less than $25.  It is also cheap compared to the computer, where I paid over $100 for a computer that is not a replacement.  3) It is small:  The size is good.  My son does not know what it is, but it is not too bulky.  The device itself is simple but still allows me to do a number of tasks:  I have just bought a DVD player, so I will use this device to burn my DVDs.  4) It does not make a lot noise:  So far, my son has not heard any noise from the device when he plays a CD.  5) It has a light:  There are two lights.  One is the one that is a toggle switch, but this will be more useful when the light is turned off.  6) It comes with a spare battery:  In most electronic devices, if there is a problem, there is usually a replacement, but I really like this because the batteries are replaceable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased my first digital camera and was so excited about it.   A couple weeks ago, the camera did a terrible job at recording video.  I went to a local camera store where my friend works and they told me it's probably a bad sensor.  My camera had the exact same problem.  The digital camera was so inexpensive, I'm happy it didn't fail me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased an iBox2 (also called a "smart TV") a few years ago, and I LOVE it. I can watch live TV and programs from networks I want to (for example, NBC, NBCSN, etc.) and the sound quality is very good, with very good audio.    The iBox is also very versatile. It can be used to watch online programs from your cable or satellite provider, watch VHS or DVD movies, and even stream some of the internet-only content (Netflix, Hulu, etc.).   If you have a few hundred dollars, it is worth the investment.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this item at a "Goodwill" in the early 1970's and never saw it again.   This was in a big black bag that was sealed and alligator-sealed (not something I'm likely to do anymore).   It has the original battery, power supply, power cord, two sets of knobs, power button (not the one that goes with the original), and power adapter that's still connected to the old one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my second laptop and my second to use the touch screen (the first one has a better graphics card).    It has a 1.2 Ghz processor and 4GB of ram, but it also has a bad screen.   After just about 2 hours of use (and with all the other windows open in the background) I noticed my computer was starting to get laggy (losing track of time or what time it is).  This seems to be a common problem with laptops in the first years, maybe due to the low end graphics card.  To fix this, I would have to use a laptop with a full 1.5 Ghz graphics card which I'm not interested in doing. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a long-time user of digital watches, especially ones in the mechanical style, as the watch itself is quite stylish. However, the Epson digital watch is quite nice to use as well, and I like the fact that it comes in the format of a digital watch.   It has a good battery life (great for the time-expired digital watches I own), it's easy to set up, and it is compact.  This is not the best watch that I own (but it is very nice), but it is better than the one that I gave away.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    There are a few things that I don't like about the Avant, namely the lack of a "sending" LED, and the tiny size of the AVA.   The fact that the "LED" doesn't work and isn't easy to see in bright light (the camera can't see it either) makes this a pretty "dumb" device.  When I send the camera into a dark place, I have the battery indicator light, but I can't seem to change it.  I have read that some people have installed a small LED into their camera for night shots, so hopefully this can be fixed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this for Christmas, and I was extremely pleased with it. The quality of the material is awesome. The battery lasts for hours, no problems. The software is simple and easy to use. The size is perfect.    I purchased a Galaxy Note 10.1 last month for a friend. It's good, but...   The screen is not as bright as the other Samsung products. The phone's buttons don't work as well as the Note 10.1. The speaker on the back is loud. The front is good, and is a bit smaller than a Note 4.

There's a bit of a learning curve with how to use it but it's not difficult to do.

The only problem I have is the fact that my laptop doesn't support wifi and   (it's not the only one that doesn't)   I've had to go out of my way to connect to wifi when I need to use it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As i mentioned earlier, my main goal for this purchase was to buy a simple digital timer for the kitchen.   I got the timer with a set of two buttons that make it "start at any time" (and can be set to stop at a certain time), and a set that has a "repeat" function.  I used to have a digital watch that I thought was really cool for the price, but I didn't like it because the "start/stop" button was a pain to use.  So I thought I would go for the same function for a few bucks less.  Unfortunately, all the buttons for it did is pause and play, not really "start".  However, the "repeat", "pause" and "stop" buttons are "useful".  I don't think the timer would have been good without these features. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first plugged in my TMP-3002 to use a computer, I did so with a great deal of trepidation. My computer was an IBM-PC compatible with the CD-ROM drive that I had bought when I was 15. The computer was just out of date, with the wrong operating system, and was difficult to use. When I decided to upgrade to a more recent model, I found the same problem: the computer would freeze up, the CD would not read, and I had to go back to the store and buy a new hard drive. But when I plugged in the TMP at that very moment, I discovered that my old CD-rom had no problem reading. I used the TPM-3001 at the time, but did not like the design. It is awkward to use, requires an external computer, and requires special software. The TPM is much more user-friendly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this device in conjunction with a digital pen (also electronic) to draw letters and have them printed on my monitor, which has a 1/4 inch (6 mm) diameter hole in its side.  It has been very good so far, although the first time that I put the hole in the device, I forgot to take out the battery (my pen is a 1.5mm thick, but I was worried about the thinness of the hole).    Unfortunately, my old pen, which I had on hand, is quite small.   However, the hole has a nice, gentle curve to it, which is perfect for writing with it, especially on a desk.

I can use it at work or at home as a wireless printer,  but also works as a usb card reader at my school.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a nice, small, and lightweight portable digital audio player.   It takes a full minute to initialize (about 3 or 4 minutes depending on how fast the music you're playing is) and takes up a little more space than I'd like (about 2x4").   But, once it is going, it's working.  It has a few other features not normally found in portable digital players (volume control, shuffle function, and a battery life that lasts up to 3 days).   Also, the player's size (for the size of the music files you can play) is nice and slim.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking for a good cheap digital camera for awhile.   The Olympus PEN-F has just about everything a beginner would want in a camera.  You get 3 SD/SDHC cards, a full size electronic viewfinder with a 1:1 ratio.  The camera itself is solid and feels solid, even the batteries and the lens (which I haven't tried yet).   My main reason for buying this camera is its use of the digital SLR's popular film format (although it's still film, it is better!).   (I'm in the process of building a film SLR and a professional lab)   It was on sale at B&H this past weekend and it looks like it will be $60.

This remote switch was built into the TV remote control box with a cable running from it to the set. i figured i could use a cable-cutter to make a copy of the box.  Then i thought about how the box was used to hook up a cable to the TV set; i figured that could be reused for the remote switch.  I looked around the internet for ways to do that.  Once i found a few articles on the subject, i figured out how.  And   I can say   that i'm very happy with   the results

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a huge fan of the Nintendo DS. I also own the DSi.   When Nintendo came out with the DS and put the touchscreen interface on, I was very interested.  I never owned a touchscreen cell phone, so a touchscreen was something I needed.  It wasn't too long after the launch of the DS that I started to get a bit annoyed at the fact that my battery died before the battery icon on the screen could come up.  For many years now, when I've been in a rush I've tried to plug in a new battery, but when the old battery goes flat, the DS still gets charged.  When I purchased the DS a few months ago, I thought that since the touch screen had been implemented that maybe the battery would last.  Well, the batteries are still dying, so I'm hoping that maybe Nintendo will fix the problem.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As an old school computer addict, I have used my computer quite a bit for almost 15 years.   I have a few older computers but most of them had an outdated operating system which I found very hard to use.  Recently, I came across the Clevo P2p and after reading the reviews (very good) I decided to purchase it and use it for a few months.  This computer is easy to use and has all the features you would expect from a PC computer.  The Clevos software is very easy to configure, but the actual computer is very slow.  So if you need a computer fast but don't want to spend alot on a new one, or if you are a power user, or you like the old school look of a PC,   then I highly recommend the Cevo P 2p

After about an hour or so, it stopped making the clicking sound but the screen was still flickering and flashing.  My friend's laptop stopped making clicking noises when he changed it to a different keyboard.

The front camera is better than it looks and there is some decent quality pictures.  There's no need for flash or a camera which is a plus in this climate.  This phone is also very very loud.  I'm a fan of the size and battery life.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In my opinion, the D-Link DIR-655 is a must have for home users.   It allows me to control my home entertainment center through the web-interface.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been wanting an   digital wristwatch for a while and I decided to give the Seiko SRP8017 digital watch a try.    The watch is so comfortable, it is hard to believe it's a wristwatch.  It has a big display that shows the time very well, but the watch isn't too heavy nor too small.  The display is a bit tiny so I can't read the time like I would like but it is accurate and readable and very easy to set the time.  I don't know if it will last for years like a quartz watch, but it won't be long before the Seikos on my wrist start to wear out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My computer has been broken for quite a while.   When I had to get a new laptop a year or so ago, my PC had no memory, no disk drive and was basically just a glorified PC built in a box.  When the price dropped, I tried a refurbished one from a local store.  I liked it, but I had no clue where to get the other parts I needed.  This time, I went to the store to pick up a few things:  a Hard Drive,  a Monitor,  an USB-C Cable   and the motherboard   I was a bit concerned with the color of the packaging since my computer is a bit greyed out  but I went ahead and got it anyway   It looked perfect, and the screen was a nice contrast.  After I got it home, I plugged in the Monitor and the Hard Drive and did a quick search on the web for how to set up my computer so I can do everything I want to do  (it's a Mac so I'm not sure why that's important)    After I did my things and turned it on, I saw a message on the screen that said my computer was overheating (the PC has never had a problem with overheating)  I turned off the power to the system and turned my monitor back on and sure enough, my computer began overheating   There was a message that said to "Shut off all fans."   The message told me to power down the system when the fans were off (they were on all the time)  But I couldn't do that and had to power it back on to make sure I could shut them down.  So I did what any reasonable person would do:  I restarted my computer and shut it down again.  And after restarting my computer (again) and turning my monitor off again, my monitors started to work.  The only thing that bothers me is that the monitor needs to be replaced.  Other than that, though,  I'm glad I took the chance to pick it up

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been a user of the M-Audio USB to SPDIF adapter since 2012.  I used it to record a gig with my friend, with a Tascam ULSD-4.   He was using a laptop with a USB to SDD adapter but he was having issues with the sound quality.  So he bought the M USB to SPDIF to SD card adapter, which worked perfectly.  Now we are using this adapter to record his studio sessions and also when we are playing in the studio and at home.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve the drummer from Worth Every Penny This adapter is awesome. I have used it a few times now and have been pleased with the result.  The adapter is built very well and is sturdy and easy to attach to a system.  It has the best sound quality out of any adapter I have ever used.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This device worked fine for a couple years when I had to do an in depth review to install a new battery in my Dell laptop. I had the battery replacement done by a professional and the battery charger works fine and is easy to use.   I did have to do some research to find the right charger but once I found it was made by Panasonic I bought it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device works well.   When you need to check if the car radio is on you just hit the button and the car is turned on.  The problem with that is you can only use it to turn the radio on and if you try to turn it off the car wont turn off.  When I want to use it for that purpose I just use a screw driver to pull the plug out and leave it in.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the latest version of this little thing. It has saved my life in a few very different ways.   It has solved the problem of having a defective charger that didn't work when I plugged it into my new iPhone 5.  The phone still wouldn't charge.  It's good that I discovered that it wasn't a problem of battery quality or the charger.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    First, let me say that the USB hub is very well made. The port is metal.   The hub does work though a very limited number of adapters I found (I have a Mac and an iPad.  I got the Mac adapter because I wanted to use my iPad while away from my Mac.)   Unfortunately, you are limited to the adapters available at the time the device is purchased.  For example, I found that a hub that came with an Apple laptop was not compatible with my iPad. I ended up purchasing a third party adapter to use with my iMac.  This adapter is a good one, but I found the design to be a little cheap looking.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got my G3s about 2 months ago and have only had them for a few days.   My main use is watching videos on the internet.  So far I have only used them to get some music videos (i don't have that many and don't really care what the soundtrack is)   Unfortunately I don't understand how you can use them as a "mesh network device"
