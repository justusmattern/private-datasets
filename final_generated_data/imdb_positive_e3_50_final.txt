Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that I found the movie "The Best Man" interesting and entertaining, but I also found it a little bit too long.  I was actually expecting more of a horror movie, but this is certainly a decent movie with a little too much in it to get a good feel for it.   What I liked about it was that it had some pretty good gore and that there were some well done kills.  The music was nice and it looked good in the movie, with a few things that looked to be a bit old fashioned but looked great in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A small, quiet and unassuming film from 1971.   The story is very simple and it revolves around a little boy who lives on a farm.  He is an ordinary boy who loves animals and his only love is a white cat.  One day, a mysterious stranger appears in his life.  The stranger asks the boy where his parents live.  When the little boy tells the stranger, the stranger is very angry, and turns the boy and his cat into little pigs.  Soon, the pig man takes over the farm, and his job is to catch and kill a lot of animals.  It seems that the stranger has some kind of power over his pig army, and is planning to rule the world.  I must admit that I was surprised when the little pig man got his powers, as they are quite strange.  This film is very well done and I would recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have read a lot of bad reviews of this movie.   The film's theme is a good one; a dark one.  The acting is good as well.  This is not a "good movie", but it's not bad.  For all you horror fans, you should not pass it up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a fun movie to watch with a bunch of friends and it's a good idea for a sequel, with a great cast including Bill Pullman as the hero and Chris Sarandon as his friend.   The film is about a man who has a very interesting and unique way of dealing with the world, the movie starts off very slow and I expected a slow start, but it kept up well and the movie kept things interesting.  The movie was not bad at all, it's still entertaining to watch and was very entertaining, so give it a go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie, it was really good and I really liked it because the story was pretty interesting and you saw lots of people were like "wow, we did something really great!" but you didn't really see the results of the work we were trying to do.   I was looking at the movie, and one thing that I realized is that I really like that the character who was an alcoholic was actually pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As an adult, I don't get a sense of horror from this movie, but as a kid, it was a big hit on the block. It is basically an old woman living in a haunted house, but in a good way. There are a lot of good jokes in here, and it does not feel like a cheesy movie, despite how good it is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A bit like a sequel to a well-known film, "Tootsie" focuses on a fictionalized story about a real-life character named Abby Yates. She is a beautiful young woman who becomes pregnant at a very young age and gives birth to her son in the film.   She is given the nickname "Little Tootsie," and her mother is not thrilled about her getting a girl to name after her daughter.  When she discovers that Abby is in fact the child's biological mother, and that she has named her after her, she decides to break away from the only family she has ever known and live a life on her own terms.  For an animated film this film is very well-done. The animators are obviously working hard to make the film come to life and the action sequences are very well choreographed. The special effects are excellent and the performances are all pretty good.  At the end of the film Abby is shown leaving her home in the country and she seems to have become a completely different person.  Although some of the dialog may be repetitive it is a well produced and entertaining film which is worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not going to go into great detail on this movie or on the story because the movie is great, but the soundtrack is just wonderful.   A great movie that will not leave you disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie and I can understand why people like it. I also liked it a lot for a second viewing and the DVD/Blu-ray/2-Disc release, so here is a review I did after watching it.   This movie is a fantasy movie about a wizard who decides to take his magic down south and do battle with a dragon for the love of a young boy, who is the king of a small kingdom.  The story is pretty good and the action is great, it's like a good old-time Hollywood epic from a long forgotten era.  What makes this movie even better is the soundtrack. There are no lyrics, just good music and lots of action and explosions.  This is a great movie, and it's worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting to be blown away by a bad film. I've seen plenty of bad movies and this one was not one of them. I was rather shocked by the amount of violence committed by the cops against the criminals and the level of cruelty of their treatment. It was a truly awful movie and not just because of the violence. I can't say much about it because I was just so stunned by the cruelty. I know some people find this kind of movie appealing and some people don't, but it really shocked me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great family comedy set at the famous Tilt-A-Whirl.   The story is funny and well written.  The characters are well played and the humor is spot on.  A real family fun time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The original film has a few issues, the film does not do well in terms of dialogue, which is the weakest part of the film and the actors also do not do their best because of the low budget that they have. The best parts of the movie are the cinematography, the set pieces and the performances.   I really like the cast and I would recommend the movie to anyone who likes a good action movie and loves the art direction.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that doesn't need to have a sequel, but does:  I thought I was watching a movie about a guy and a girl who would meet in a motel room and have a love affair. I was mistaken. This movie was about a group of guys who live in a trailer park and they go to a movie theater to go see a movie and when they see the guy playing a part they have a huge fight.  They then decide they have to go up against a couple of people from the city who live right next door to them and then make up the fight to make it look like a fight. Then they get on the train to go to another town and the train gets in an accident and the driver has to crash the car into a tree so they can get the tickets to get to the next town.   This movie is a bunch of dumb assholes that want to be cool.  I hope they get hit with a tree or something so they die, the only other movie I've seen this year that has more bad guys would have to be   Iron Fist . This is another movie that seems to take itself so damn seriously. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very nice surprise. I've liked a few movies in the past, and this one is a fine example. It has a bit of a "so bad it's good" aspect to it, and a good ending as well.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie so much. The story is super-fun, and it's actually my favorite movie of the year so far (or at least, until I see The Guest on the 23rd of March), and it has a fantastic soundtrack.   A lot of my favorite comedians are in this movie, and some of them (such as Dave Chappelle and Jon Glaser) really take off with their roles.  It's a fun movie with some of the best dialogue I've heard in years.  As for myself, I'm still going to keep watching this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It's not my cup of tea, but I like it. It has a real "noir" feel to it that I like.   It's a good, solid movie with a good story that I couldn't put down once I started watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good adventure comedy with a unique storyline and character development. The animation is great, and the music is great as well. The story is original, and interesting. The movie is about a young boy who lives on an island in the middle of the ocean. He has a dog, a cat and a catfish, a monkey, a duck, and a fish. One day, he is rescued from a sinking ship by a boy. Then, the boy is attacked by a shark. The boy and the girl in the story are friends, and their friendship is tested in a lot of different ways. The girl is a strong and determined young woman, the boys are very much alike, and you will have fun with them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In "Sleeper," Steven Soderbergh tells the story of two people whose sleep is disturbed and whose lives are affected. They meet when one of the men, who has been shot, is found in a bathroom stall. The other man has to sleep in the same bathroom stall for a couple of days to be in contact with the other man.   I never thought I would like a Steven S, but I really like this film.  I saw the film on the big screen at the Regal and it looks great. I think the film looks like it was shot by one person and then someone else went over the top and made it look like a movie.  The film has a lot of great action scenes.  One scene that sticks out in my mind is the car chase in the desert.  Steven S is an action man and I love the action in this film (and I loved the action scenes in "Slumdog Millionaire" as well).  This film is not for everyone, but if you enjoy action and car chases, then this will not disappoint you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a big fan of the "Star Wars" series, and I think this is a good one. The story is a lot like "Star Trek."   It's a time travel story, where a group of characters are in space and the only way out is to go back in time. This film is good, with plenty of action.   If you love action, sci-fi, and a good story, this is for you!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a little bit like a comedy, a little more serious, and an even little more ridiculous than that, but it's well done enough to make you laugh along the way. It's hilarious all the way through, and that doesn't mean it's all-out funny, it just has that feeling of a bad movie you wouldn't want to watch, like you know it will turn out so badly.   I really like the movie, but at the same time it's a bit hard to take. You know the movie is going to be bad, but you don't want it to be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like to watch movies where nothing is said in the story, and just the characters talk a lot, and there's nothing but fun to be had while watching it.    The main character is very charming.  His hair looks like the hairs on a man's face, and his voice is like the voice of a monkey talking.  A man's life is about a lot of fun and a lot being done with it, and if it's not done right, it's going to end very badly.  This movie will make you laugh and it will also make you feel very good.  I was happy to see the new Star Trek series go on the air and I hope they will continue it in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... This is a movie that is really, really bad.   But at the same time, it is an entertaining movie.  So you are going to watch this if you have a sense of humor, and are not afraid of a good laugh.  I liked the movie. I was laughing when I was watching it.  The story and characters are not my thing.  In my opinion, this movie needs a complete rewrite. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't mean it's a great movie, but it's good. I like this movie because it has a lot of action, a lot more than your typical action movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this movie isn't bad, but not very good either. I loved the movie, and it was worth the watch. I think I might have to get a 3D glasses as well so that I can see the faces better, but the story is really interesting. The movie takes place in a village in a region of the U.S. called 'The Great White North' (the White North) about 150 years ago. It is a rural and poor region that was so isolated that a whole bunch of Indians had been living there, and by the end of the movie they are pretty much completely forgotten by everyone. Then a group of American soldiers come over and are welcomed, and everyone starts to have fun with them. This is very strange, because the story seems to be pretty much lost, but it doesn't stay lost. There is a very interesting plot which you can't quite understand. Some things are shown that you have to look up and I have to tell you there is a lot to see. The characters are all very interesting. You have a young farmer named John, who is quite the anti-hero. He has a hard time trying to understand the Indians, and has trouble talking to them at first. He tries to be more friendly, but can't get over the fact that they don't seem to understand him. There are lots of interesting places in this movie, but you have a hard enough time keeping track of the action, because there is so much going on. At times it seems as if it takes place all at once, like you're watching a movie that was shot simultaneously. One problem I have is the ending. The ending seems to me to be a little too quick, and I don't know what the message is about. It was fun, and the characters were well done, but I think it is best if the story was continued. But, I have nothing against this movie and would recommend it to anyone. It has an interesting story, and interesting action, but doesn't go too far off track to be confusing or boring. It does a good job with the rural setting and the theme of American Indians, but just isn't too good in its execution. If you're interested in history or Indian movies this is worth a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason I give it 3 out of 4 is because it is a movie that should not have been made at all.   It is a bad film.  To say that it is "bad" is a huge understatement.  It does not live up to the hype.  The storyline is terrible.  There are some very minor scenes that are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie.  I have no problem with a movie being "bad".  I just don't feel like it is worth a watch.  So please, don't waste your time.  - December 21, 2007A bad movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love "I'm a Bad Cook", you will love this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like this movie. The movie is well written and the story is pretty good. It is an old fashioned western, and is pretty interesting. I can only think that because this is a Western, there is very little action, which I love. But if you are in the mood for some action, you will get it. The main story has a little twist to it, and it is not as simple as I thought, but it was still a good flick. This movie is an enjoyable flick, but I think it is best if you know the story and don't want to re-watch it. I have already watched it at least four times, and there are still several scenes that I am still looking forward to. The cast is very good. I liked the cowboy, and I liked his daughter and his wife. This was my second time watching this movie, but my second watch was not as bad as my first. It was a good ride, and a fun flick to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting more from this movie because the reviews on here were so good. Unfortunately, it does not live up to these reviews and there is absolutely no redeeming factor in this movie. I'm disappointed because it is a fun watch and the movie has a lot of good ideas, but the direction is too sloppy to be really engaging, and the action scenes were not all that exciting either.

He comes out of a cave and has his porkpie friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think you all know that I love a good love story.   And that's not even my favorite love story...   But in this case, it's about the love of a mother and a son, so I guess that's what counts.  I think it's pretty sweet, so if you have a crush on a certain actor or a particular actress, then this might be a good idea. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was initially surprised to find that this movie is a remake of the 1990 movie. It is actually better than the 1990 one. The story takes a turn toward the darker and more supernatural side of the genre. I found it to be a fairly well written movie that just keeps going and going. I'm actually looking forward to the sequel. I like how they brought in a couple of new blood and it showed. They actually have a good villain.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I was so excited to see this movie, it came out right when I was getting ready for Christmas.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful old movie about a man who is obsessed with a woman who is about 30. We are all in love with the poor guy, but he gets very jealous of her looks. The way he looks at her in his room is always the most beautiful I've ever seen. He wants to be her friend, but every time they are alone he talks about how she should be his wife, and the rest of us laugh.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife saw this with me in the theater and we both loved it. The plot was a little complicated but it was so good that it worked.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the movie does a great job of portraying the lives of the two main characters.   They are both pretty much on a perpetual high from being out of town a lot to the point that one may wonder what they're going to do when they get home.  The film does a good job of showing the highs and lows of the characters as well.  It is a fun and funny movie.  I really like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what this movie is? It's a good thriller about a man who falls in love with a beautiful girl who has a secret, and a secret that no one else could find out about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love horror movies. I hate horror movies that try to be "realistic" and then fail miserably.   There is a great movie about a demon.  Yes, I know he looks a little like the devil, but he does have a heart of gold. I never thought I'd like a demon, but it is so fun to watch him.  What made it all worthwhile:  I was so shocked when I watched this that I thought the whole movie was a dream. I also found it very believable.  I am a huge horror fan and this was a great experience for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to begin with saying that I have not watched any of the previous four Star Trek movies. I will make a brief mention of this one as it does not have the same feel of "The Original Series"   In fact, I felt it was rather lacking in a number of ways. There were moments in the beginning when things started to get a little too on-the-nose. It was almost as if a number were being played off each other;  . This may have been a case of "too much of a good thing"  I should also make a quick remark about the use of computer generated images in this movie. The computer created "effects" did not do a particularly good job in the sense that there was not enough of a feeling of realism in a scene that involved an alien being exposed to "hyper-energy" (see previous entry). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at my friend's house (not their house, but the living room) and my dad came to pick me up. This is a great movie. A great film with a great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't like the movie very much but I do have to say that it was an enjoyable ride.   It was an hour-long film about a boy who gets into a gang of bullies to protect the little girls at school.  At the beginning, the movie is very entertaining but as the film goes on, you realize that it is the kind of movie that's hard to like but still enjoyable to watch.  In this movie, the kids seem to know the names of the bullies but there's really no reason for this.  The bully is played by Joe Estevez who had a role in one of my favorite films,   Lagaan.  He really brings out the comedy in this movie.  For the most part, the children don't seem to be much of a threat so they get left alone by the bullies and have to watch them get bullied.  But the film is much more enjoyable because of the gang of kids.  Some of them are so funny and have an amazing sense of timing and are very entertaining.  It really gives you a laugh every once in awhile and makes you smile.  I think the kid who plays the boy is really the best character in the movie because he actually brings a sense of fun to the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a huge fan of the classic horror movie The Evil Dead. I thought it was a pretty fun movie, but it's a tad on the generic side. That is, the scares aren't that great and the gore isn't that bad. It's just boring.   There was a certain scene that was really disturbing to me.  I didn't see it coming.  And it still haunts me a little bit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film begins with the narrator, played by Ben Kingsley, speaking to an audience of British students about how he went through a "meltdown" after his father's death. The audience applauds, and then the narrator goes into an explanation about how his father, John Kingsley (Peter O'Toole), had a big role in the war in France and the war to the East. He was in a battle with Hitler's army in Poland when the Nazis occupied Poland, and it was his first visit to Germany. He found a hotel that had been burned down and the soldiers had killed his father. He managed to escape through a window, where he encountered a German sniper, and was given a drink by a Jewish refugee who had been hiding under the window. The narrator goes on to explain how Hitler's troops were trying to find the Jewish refugees to kill them, and they found the young Jewish refugees living under the balcony. The Jewish refugee gave them shelter. They also found the British spy and captured him. He tells the story about the Jews in the hotel, and how Hitler had been trying to "fix" them, giving them work in the factories of his Nazi regime. He talks about the Jewish war hero Siegfried Sassoon (John Gielgud), and how he saved the world by using his Jewishness as a way to protect Britain from the Germans. At the end, the narrator gives his story, and his father dies, along with a lot of Jews, including his father-in-law. In his final speech, the Nazi soldier says to him: "You are the greatest liar in Europe." The narrator says to the camera: "This is a lie."   The film ends with a shot of the narrator's house.   This is a very good film, about a man who survived Nazi occupation, and became a "Hitler whisperer." The film is also about his father and the Nazi troops who were trying (and failing) to find him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film about a man with a huge passion for boxing that is matched only by his size. He meets a girl who he loves, then he gets a job and has to go to a boxing match and wins a fight and is invited back to a girl's home. The girl falls in love with him. I was not surprised at the love triangle. It seems a little odd to have a love triangle in a movie about a guy with a passion for fighting. A guy who knows that he is a small man doesn't really have to do much to be admired. The film is good, good action, great characters. Not to mention that there are only 2 guys on the screen fighting at the end.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like "Warm Bodies", "A Man and a Woman" is a great little romance. The love is genuine and genuine. The movie is a real treat for any lover of romance. And the good guy is played by a wonderful actor, Bill Murray, in a marvelous performance. The film is a nice, happy picture, with plenty of humor and charm. There is a wonderful song, a song written by Robert Shaw, sung by a very talented, lovely girl named Susan Sontag, as well.   The cast was great. And Bill Murray does a superb job in the role of the good-guy guy, and the film is just a great treat for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's like a movie is saying: "Hey, I'm a guy who works for a major corporation. You're an attractive lady from the Midwest. You'll be my best buddy for life."   While it's easy to be enamored with the film, it is so full of laughs and has so much character development (including some character deaths) that it's hard to not smile.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is interesting and very good at the same time, although a little too dark at the beginning. The movie is interesting at all, but is in fact very short.   I like the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited about this movie. I am a big fan of the old Batman movies from the 80's and it seems that a Batman movie will be coming soon. I love this movie!   What an excellent movie this is.   It starts out very cheesy but keeps a good pace. The script by David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio is great. There is a good mix of laughs and dramatic action scenes.  The movie also has a lot of action in it. My only problem is I wish they would have done more action scenes in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge fan of horror movies (I watch them regularly), so this one wasn't for me. I'm usually not a fan of "found footage" type movies. They usually make no sense to me, they're often filmed in a weird way, they have all sorts of creepy and strange shots, and I generally don't like to have anything to do with them. They all have a common theme of some kind of evil entity (and usually it's just a ghost, but not always) that goes after the main characters and/or scares the crap out of them. I always see these movies as cheesy, and at worst, they aren't really good movies. The one exception I can think of is The Exorcist (1973), but it's basically a found footage movie, so it's nothing like that. I don't have a problem with them as much as I do with cheesy horror movies, but I won't watch these again... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A few days ago I had a craving for some bad action movies and saw some old ones which were bad but they had fun parts and I was glad to finally see a good one:  My second favorite bad action movie of all time. I loved the bad fight scenes.  I got a lot of laughs from it and when the bad guy fell and he went out of the room I thought "Man, this is fun!" And when the first bad guy got shot...I was glad I was there and was even happier when the guy with the rifle said "Hey, let's finish this now!" I love the bad guys who get shot in the ass.  The movie has a good ending but it was fun and the bad side guy was funny as fuck.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off with a slow but pleasant slow build.   What can I say, it's got a good story, and the movie keeps it real by the end, but the slow build is the thing that keeps the movie interesting.  A bit of a cliche for the time period but it's still a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think I'm going to write a positive rating for this movie. It's one of those movies where a lot of interesting things happen, but not in a good way, and that's what it seems to be, so the movie has a great gimmick, but that gimmick comes in the form of a pretty bad movie.   The film starts with a prologue, about a guy that has a weird dream of a girl, and he finds a little girl in the woods with a strange man (the film has a lot more to offer but that's for another review). The woman is in the house with the man who's a clown, and they talk, but then the man leaves, and the woman is very confused, but she goes in the attic and she looks at a bunch of old magazines, and she finds a picture, and then the woman begins to realize the man is really, a man, and a girl. They have a lot to talk about and they end up at a pool hall (a pool hall I have never seen or heard about), and the girl ends up talking to a man who was in a movie theater where a young girl was killed, and there was a girl who played the lead in that movie. The woman says she knows a man and he's been following her. Then the man says he was in the movie theater too, when a young boy was killed. It doesn't go on to explain the movie or who killed the boy. And the film has its own kind of weird movie structure, with flashbacks and dream sequences that are not clearly stated and the story being a kind of convoluted story about the man and a little boy who meets the woman, and all the people who knew him, and some characters that seem to just be in a dream. It feels like a story about a bunch characters who were trying to tell the story of a dead kid, but they all forget the whole time about what happened, so it makes sense they get all worked up about the kid, and it all kind of comes together to end up in this creepy place of a pool halls and a lot (not enough) of dead people, and I don the sense that there's a little story in this film, but it's not explained. I don?t want to give the movie a bad review. It has some interesting ideas, and maybe even some interesting characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is very interesting, and the characters are all well developed, I like the way the villain is portrayed, it makes sense, his motives are not really a bad thing in my eyes, they just are a bit misguided. As for the movie itself I thought it was really well acted, with a good blend of comedy and drama, even if the villains were just a little unrealistic. I think it's a little short, but I found it to be a good action flick, but it doesn't have the heart of a good story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like you I'm a huge fan of movies like "Planet of the Apes" and "Tron"   The characters were all well done and all acted well.   I like that this movie isn't a sci fi movie but something else that's a bit different   "The Green Inferno" by David Cronenberg, was a big winner for me

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's hard to make a good action movie, but I think the producers succeeded in that endeavor. It's got a lot of action scenes. I really liked them. There is one where you're trying to escape a group of armed men who are torturing a prisoner and you jump over a fire hydrant. I love that scene.    I would have preferred that there had been more on the story than the violence, but overall it was fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first "Sons of Anarchy" season was awesome.   I have a great time watching this show.  The characters are great, and the story is good.  But "Sober Man" is not for everyone.  I got a bit frustrated at the beginning.  A couple of characters were not what they were portrayed to be.  If the story was good, I would like it.  My problem is that the characters do not come across as realistic.  You know a character is lying or faking, and you know he is not doing so because he is ashamed or because he needs to protect his family.  We never really see the "Suns" come out and say, "Yes, I lied.  That was not my intention.  This is a story.  Don't believe what you see in the newspapers and on the internet.  Here is what happened.  There were two young men, Donny and Frank.  They were high school graduates. They lived in Phoenix, Arizona.  On the night of September 28, 1990, they were out driving around town.  Frank had a large amount of marijuana in his possession, Donnie had $400 cash in his handbag.  Before midnight, Frank pulled over to the side of the road.   Frank had never been arrested for a crime.  He had never even been in trouble with the law. He had been clean for years.  When Donnie got out of his car, Frank ran toward him.  In the process, Frank hit a curb and his car slid into a ravine.   Both Frank and Donnie were thrown out of the car.  Luckily, the passenger side was already crushed.  Despite the trauma, the car continued for miles and survived. Frank then crawled out of a creek, holding Donnie's head under his armpits. Donnie lay dead in the ravine for over an hour.  Fortunately, a woman with a 4-wheel-drive and a neighbor came across the scene.  She alerted the Phoenix Fire Department.  At first, it appeared that the men were simply asleep. But they awoke, and one started to run, the other was lying down in the ditch.   They called the police.  While a police officer was trying to determine if there was a third male in the car, Dona and Frank called one another. Donny, with his head in his hands, could not
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter films. I really love how they capture the magic and the romance of a young boy. I'm also a huge fan of his relationship with Ron Weasley. They are really cute together. The films are filled with fantastic, magical scenes. The Harry and Ron relationship is a love story, not the normal one. Harry and his relationship is more like a young friendship than a couple. It has been the biggest love story of my life. It started when I was 9 years old. This love story was not the usual one. This is the Harry and Hermione romance that was made into a movie.    One of the biggest problems in the movie is how Harry gets angry that he won't be allowed to do magic on his own. He does a little spell that causes all of his friends to become ghosts. I thought this was a little funny, as you can see how upset Harry is about not being able to do the thing that his friends would do. But it is very stupid, as he is unable to do any magic at all. Then, Ron tells him that Harry was trying to show him a spell that they have been working on for months. It is a spell to turn a ghost into a tree and to make a girl's voice go up a tree. Harry does this and a girl appears on a tree stump saying: "Harry! Where are you? I thought you had left me on a broomstick and had gone off to play Quidditch with Dudley and friends. I must be a girl... Oh, you are so funny, Harry, like a child playing a trick on his father." Harry does not believe her. He goes away, only to be told a short time later that a girl has turned into a ghost. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good thriller. The acting is well done with all the right things to make the film a good film. I like that the film was done by a woman. There is not much about her that is unusual but I like it. The film has a very unusual subject. The story is about an employee of a very popular restaurant who gets killed while she was there. I'm not sure if the killer got out of the restaurant. I found it very difficult to follow. The ending was a little unsatisfying. I was very disappointed with the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (July 1st, 2008) I saw this movie at a friend's house and we all were blown away by it. The writing was amazing and the acting was brilliant. It was so realistic that even the characters could not help but look away from the camera to avoid being watched. It is like a small town drama and a very good one. It would be nice to see another one as it was very good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very fun, upbeat movie with a very good message. The movie opens with the family of five (three males, one female) playing a board game called "Who's On First?"   The father (George Clooney) wants to start a family, but he has to marry a woman. It takes him a lot of effort to get the girl, and he must give up his career and his friends.   Eventually the daughter (Scarlett Johansson) takes to him. He realizes that there is a girl in his future, he will eventually make a good wife for her.  Eventually things take a turn.  As a mother's day gift to her daughter, the father brings home an ancient relic. It turns out to be something much more important than it seems.  A group of Native Americans has come down from Canada to take over the world.  The group is made up of a Native American chief named White Crow, a war chief named Red Hawk, a "wizard" named Snake Eyes, and a man known as Thunder.  There is also a group of renegade American Indians called the Sons of Randal.  In order to save the world, the Sons and Thunder must team up with White Crow and Red Hawk.  What follows is a story about the conflicts between good and evil and how they are resolved through fun and entertainment.  When the time comes for the "first" battle the Sons take off on a long journey to find the secret to their success.  Scarlett Johansson is excellent in this movie. She does a very convincing "whore" role, which she is very good at. She is really in charge of the movie, and the others in it (especially the bad guys) look to her for direction.  Even though she is in control in most scenes, there are a few that are actually funny.  One scene I really like is a fight scene between Red Hawk and White Crow. There are a couple of nice sequences in this film, but it is not a bad movie.  It is not too long, so you can finish it in two hours.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was skeptical about this movie when I first watched it, but I really enjoyed it. It has a lot of funny moments and is very funny. It's a fun movie, but if you have a soft spot for a comedy movie and think you won't like it, think again. I'm glad I saw it and would recommend it to anyone that likes a good laugh and has some time to kill. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never did like Jaws. It was kind of a mess. I hated the shark. It was horrible. The other guys that are in the movie are all a bunch of scumbags. I mean they act like they're better than they are. They have this sort of lame guy that is always talking about how great and cool they are, and the girl is always getting eaten or getting kidnapped or something, I mean what's the point in that. The ending sucked, I don't even know what happened to the shark except he had a heart attack at some point and died, so that was kinda cool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie.   This movie has got some real emotional scenes that can make your heart melt. I love how this movie takes some of the classics like the classic silent film and they try and recreate them in a way that is just as good.  I think that most people out there would enjoy this movie because it really is just that good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's one of the most popular science fiction films of all time.   For a long time, I always wondered how many of the more successful sci-fi films were based on novels.  Like in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" they used an idea from the book "The Time Machine" by H. G. Wells.  After watching the movie you would think that this is a completely different film.  In fact, "The Fly" was based on the novel by Robert Heinlein (1921-1986) who himself is a big fan of the film.    There's a lot of action in "Time Machine".  A lot of it was shot in a very unusual way.  You could get a clear view of the entire universe.  And at one point the characters were flying very fast.  I can understand why they did that.  The whole movie seemed to move so fast it felt like it was moving in slow motion.  At times it got really ridiculous.  But then there was also a lot to learn about our universe.   At first I didn't like the time machine. It looked so stupid. But then when I saw how fast they could travel, I got a lot more interested.  This was a good introduction to the idea of time travel.  Now a few more years have passed and I feel a lot better about the movie.  What makes a good time machine?   Time machines are useful inventions that allow you to change the history of your world. The basic idea is that you can use a time machine to go back and fix what happened in the past.  Well, that sounds simple. But the problem is that they don't always work.  If the Earth wasn't hit by a huge solar storm in the year 2000, you could travel back in time. But it was just a theoretical idea.  Unfortunately, the time travel in the movie is a little ridiculous. Here is an excerpt from Wikipedia :  One time travel paradox occurs if a device such as the DeLorean (which was invented and appeared in the film) could travel through space and time but not backwards.  "If a time-traveling device could traverse space and also time, then the time traveler should have gone back in the first place,"   However, in actuality, the "warp drive" in the Time Machine only made the characters travel faster than the speed of light. But since
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As someone who has had the pleasure of watching the original "Star Trek," which was my second introduction to Star Trek, I am disappointed that I missed the "Enterprise" sequel (though I don't believe "Enter Enterprise" would have been such a bad movie. It has its moments but it is nothing exceptional in the way that the original was.   I did really love the way they portrayed some of the crew members.  I thought there was a great touch that had to do with how some people felt about being under captain's orders.  Like the original, I think we have seen it all and don't need more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of a young boy and a little girl who have to find their way in a dangerous, abandoned mansion.   This is a well made movie with a lot of heart, and a lot to show for the lack of money that the producers had in their budget.  The music is great, and there's plenty of heart to it.  I'll keep this one in my head for the next year, it's a great movie, and I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very enjoyable movie with a fun plot, that is about a "bunch of misfits", who must deal with their problems in the meanest and meanest ways they can.   It is hard to describe the feeling the movie gives when a few "oddballs" from the streets of a small village in Ireland suddenly come together and decide to take the "city" of London by storm.  Some characters are good and some are bad.  But it is never boring.  The story is good, and even if it does have a few flaws, it is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was my third time watching this movie and it's another good one. I'm not a big fan of comedies but this one was fun. We see some characters with a strange personality (and not in a good way). This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I loved how the guy with a crazy family lived up to his name as he had some weird jokes to make with the family and his family. I can't even remember what it was that he said but it was funny. It also had some of the greatest sound effects i've ever heard in a movie. They were good! It was well made too with a great plot and some great characters. The only thing that I can criticize is the movie ended a bit too fast because we get to see the families reaction. This is a good watch but with a slow build up.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're looking for a fun movie, but not for long, this one's for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not as good as "The Martian" (by the way, don't try to compare this to that movie, or you will be missing the point), but it's a decent movie with a good story (of course). It's a little bit similar in terms of story to "The Fifth Element", but the characters are more well developed and the writing is more descriptive of the different planets of our solar system.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I found that the movie is a very interesting one. It has a lot of things going on, all the time, but it is not easy to follow. I think you need some patience to be able to follow what is going on. It is a good idea to put some of these people in prison and try to find a way to get them to a good prison. They have to work together to get through the prison. It does not look like the prisons are easy to get into. It looks like it takes a long time to get in. It will take a while to find some of the people that are trying to be released. It really looks like a hard time for a lot. The movie is interesting to me and I wish I could have seen it more than once. It gives me something to think about. I am thinking about the future when I am watching it now.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am going to say right up front that this movie is a movie where I felt the director did a good job, because the story was a story that made me feel, not only because it was told well, but because it took a simple thing like a man, who wants to be a doctor, and turned it into a movie that made a man feel as if he was a doctor.   This movie has a good cast, and a good story, but the story does go a little far, and the way the film tries to make the man feel like a doctor is just ridiculous.  The cast is good, and I liked the way they were portrayed by the director, but it just doesn't seem to add up when the man's story is thrown on top of a story where a man tries to be the best doctor in the world.  I would say that I enjoyed the movie a lot. It has some good ideas, and it seems like a nice movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen all three versions of the "Halloween" franchise; the remake in 2002, the first "Halloweentown" and this one.   The remake was a big improvement on the original movie and was much better for the money.  It was fun and scary, but not too much so for a film at least.  The original "Halt and Catch Fire" was my favorite of the three films, but I can't give this a higher rating because I didn't like it nearly as much as I liked the remake.  I'm a fan of the original "Gus" and have watched it a few times, but it's not nearly as fun as the remake was.  If the original was like this version, it would be an enjoyable film, but as is it was a fun, scary little horror comedy that I enjoyed.  After seeing "Halo 3" last year I was not surprised that there was a remake of "Halls of the Dead".  The sequel is an improvement on that, and a lot of fun to watch as well.  This film was like the "Gut" movies of old, but a little less boring.  When it was originally released it had a great cast of characters.  However, "Hells" is a great version of a great movie.

The first act is very entertaining and very well acted. The second act is much better but the movie doesn't have enough tension. It's a good thriller with some good performances but it doesn't make up for a bad movie overall. I recommend it but I would have liked more tension, more action, and better acting.

He did a very good job portraying the character   and made it so funny!   The first scene is the most amazing and funny one!    The music of the film  (Bebel und Freude) was also very good, but not as good as it was in the movie  (Sünde).   This is a must watch if you are a fan of the comedy, with the jokes, the characters.  If you don't know this movie, then go out and watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a masterpiece.   The plot is pretty simple: a guy has a love for a girl he's never met, who's the opposite of him, and they just happen to be married in the same town.  But before they get married, she goes to another town (that she can't remember) and becomes a waitress there.  Then she learns that she has a brother named Paul who lives in that town (but not where she was raised), and she decides to take Paul to that town. In other words, the story is set in the middle of the US, and is really about growing up.  I would watch this movie again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was hoping to see the original Star Wars movies as well as the first 3 Star Wars books that were in the collections of my local library and there are actually several. So I didn't have to wait long to see Return of the Jedi again. In fact, it may have been a while since I've seen Return of The Jedi so I didn' think I was going to like it much. I thought it was alright. That's about all I can say about it. In the end, I'm not too sure. I don't have many bad things to say about this movie. However, I'll admit there is a pretty bad scene where a young Princess is held captive by the Sand People, but I didn?t mind it too much. Not a lot of action but at least it had a story to it. I was surprised at how much I liked the film. It was better than I thought. I think the story was well done. I did enjoy it and I didn'?t find it to be a bad film. I really do like The Phantom Menace. It is a good film and a good story. I liked it a lot and I liked a lot about it? it really had a great cast. I hope I can watch it again. I still have not seen The Empire Strikes Back but it was better. It had a much better story and more action than the first film. In other words, I liked Star Wars?s The Phantom.

It's good that we were not only able to watch it through but we were able to see a movie where there are some very dark and creepy scenes and things that are more extreme than I thought would have been portrayed.   This movie is about a group of people in a hospital who are kept prisoner on a spaceship and who get killed by the aliens on the last day before they can be killed.  So I really liked it and I thought it was a very well-done movie. I thought I was pretty bad at science fiction movies until I saw this one.

I was also impressed by the idea of a character that tries to kill a small girl by using a small knife and is only stopped when he comes face to face with the small girl's mother. This was a good idea, it worked very well, and it gave me a nice warm feeling when the small boy kills the little girl.   This was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. It made me laugh very hard, and the good dialogue made me enjoy it even more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I mentioned earlier, the story of the film is a rather complicated one, and so is the film itself, which is not surprising for a movie with a title like "The Night of the Hunter." It begins by setting up the premise that the narrator, known as "Mr. Hunter," is a real detective whose wife is murdered, which puts him in a position of working with the local authorities to get to the bottom of the case. However, Mr. Hunter is himself under suspicion from some of his colleagues and even from his wife. What really drives the story is the story between the husband and wife as he tries to make sense of her death. As he starts to get closer to the truth behind her death, things start to get rather complicated, and it is not long before he realizes he is in over his head.   While the story certainly has its fair share of twists and turns, the film also had its fair bit of twists as well. There were some parts where I found myself just completely stumped. For example, there was one part where Mr. H. Hunter was going into a house where his wife was murdered. He went in there to find his wife's body, which was still wearing a yellow bikini top with flowers around it. He found a note on her body from his estranged wife that said something about his wife having sex with another man and then having a "dream about a tiger." (In the end, I don't really understand what was so terrifying about this dream, but it didn't really matter.) The story also had some truly horrifying scenes. For instance, when the husband of the deceased woman is attacked by a wild tiger at the base of a tree at night, which I thought was rather horrifically done. One of my favorite parts was the scene where Mr and Mrs. Hunter find a note from his ex-wife that was taped to a nearby lamp post that said they should take their relationship outside of marriage. I found that idea very, very clever. I was actually impressed by the film's humor, which for the most part was fairly well done.  In addition to the good humor, the movie had some other good ideas. It was very nice that the filmmakers included several bits of "meta-fictional" information about crime fiction and mystery fiction. For the most of the movie, Mr Hunter is a great detective, but by the time the final confrontation between Mr. and Mrs Hunter is played out, his wife has
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of people I loved this movie, it was a bit boring but I like to laugh at myself when I do something stupid. I like the humor, the funny accents, the stupid jokes. I also loved the fact that in the first two days I had to watch about 30 movies.   It really made me laugh and made me feel good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie "Alone in the Dark" was a movie I never knew I wanted to see. In fact, I was not even sure I wanted a horror movie at first until the first shot of a man's head being kicked up into a tree and falling down was played over the soundtrack (which I am not exaggerating). I was so scared by this that I couldn't watch it again until the very end when I was in an insane rage to the point where I was screaming at the TV screen. After this first sequence I thought I knew where this movie was going (in the direction of a "Twilight Zone" type of episode). The movie does a great job at pulling us into the story and even gives us a twist or two of the plot. It is about a couple that are searching for a haunted house. The house itself is quite spooky and you just feel really uneasy when you are watching it. The movie really puts you in the mindset of a person who has done some things, or is about to do a lot of things, which the movie tries to warn you about (the things that they did). The one thing I found so creepy about this movie is that you feel like your going into a very dark and dreary place and you cannot go back to your normal life. It was creepy just watching it! This movie is only about 15 minutes long, but that is enough to tell you what kind of movie this is. The soundtrack is very good and I would recommend this movie to any horror movie fan. I am sure you will love this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago, I was talking to a good friend of mine who is a writer, who is also a wonderful person. We were talking about a movie he's about to do. He had just come from his movie set, and he was talking about how he's writing a new book and writing a movie, and all these wonderful movies, one of which is a new classic, with Robert Mitchum, who's a great actor, who had a wonderful career, he was in a lot of wonderful films in the '70s, and now he's going to do one of the greatest movies ever made, a film that has everything, and one of these movies that he has all of the right people in it, and it's really, really fun to watch, and the actors do a wonderful job, and so you can have it all here with this great movie.   This is a movie that will be remembered by people for a long time, and we all have to see it and be impressed, to see the greatness of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie about a girl who is having an adventure with a boy, who lives on a boat. The girls love each other and they are all very interesting characters.   The main character in this movie is very cute, and has a kind of a "I don't care" way of speaking.  She is very sweet and loves her cat.  I also love the movie and I think everyone should go and see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. There were things that I hated. But in the end, I still loved it. I didn't like that it made the ending too easy. But it wasn't hard. I liked that they didn't waste any time in getting the action started and finished. I also liked that there was a good scene after the first part when the cops had the good guy and a bad guy go after a man named John.   It's a very good movie. I like this one much better than the other John Woo movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this film is a good watch if you can take it. The story starts with a father and son, who has a car accident, and dies of a heart attack. The father then gets a job at a hospital, and gets a pregnant woman, and is the one who is going to take care of the baby. The film begins in a small way, but continues to grow until the climax. There's also a very funny song, which you will have to listen to, it was very amusing. It is about a man who is an alcoholic, and tries to get in touch with his dead father, who had been a cop. And he meets a woman who is a policeman too. The policeman is more experienced than the father and tries talking to him, but he is only interested in the drinking. The son is the same, but is married to the woman. And they have a little boy, who is not even 3. The man who drinks the most and smokes the most is the father. It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't make any progress, and some parts can't be taken seriously, like the guy who takes over the body of the dead dad, and becomes the drunk dad. That was not funny. But it was a good idea. You can watch it anytime, if you want to see a good story about a guy trying to be a father.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You guys: I am an American. My mom is a Canadian and my dad is a British. I am a film nerd and a fan of British movies. I'm also a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and, in my view, the films of J.R.R Tolkien. So, I had to find a way to watch these movies as if I were in a foreign land. It's like the whole world fell in love with a movie about wizards. I liked it so much that I asked my mom if we could rent the films. She said we can't because we have to rent the video and I said, "I can't wait to watch it." So I watched the entire trilogy (which is over 400 minutes long, but, hey, that's a lot of movies). I will say that, while I liked all three movies, Lord of The Rings is the better of the three. I also found that the movies are quite hard to watch, so that makes them even better. So many different cultures and all of their languages. I didn't understand a word of anything, but they didn't seem to care. In fact, when it came to characters, I thought they were stereotypical Anglo-Saxon. But, then I thought about it, and they don't know how to speak English, so they're probably the only ones who speak like that. So that's probably not a big issue. I think it's more that they're trying to look like the British so they can blend in, which is a good thing. I don't think it was a real problem. This is a fantasy movie. This wasn't a documentary. This isn't like a documentary about what the world is like. It was a fantasy world with wizards, elves and a couple of dwarves, and it made a lot more sense to me. I will try to summarize the stories of the films in a way that is not too boring, but I'm sure I can't do it justice. Also, the movies don't have an ending. That is the reason I didn`t understand the end of each movie, but that's also the reason why I really liked them all. I have watched the movies over and over again, and each time, I like it more. So go ahead and rent Lord ofTheRings. I'll be here, waiting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a bit of a throwback to the 60's with a nice blend of adventure and romance.   A young female detective comes across a young girl who has been taken away from her mother, who has fallen ill in an asylum and has committed suicide. This is where the film takes a turn towards the dark side as she finds a series of sinister clues.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not one to give movie a bad review but  ..   is   a great movie about the history of the    American   Navy   and   sea   battles of the period.   The movie is great.  As the movie starts there's a small story of the first war with China and the Navy.  I don't really know what's the story is but I like the idea of the movie.  At that time a Japanese admiral, named Yamashita, who was a major in the navy, a war hero and he was planning to create a navy to match the  American  Navy.  He found a Chinese merchant who is very rich and wanted to buy a  Japanese  maritime ship.  But the ship was captured and Yamashitahk (the Chinese commander of the vessel) was captured.   After this capture he's sent to an island called  Amchow  where there are no food and a typhoid fever is spreading.  After three days he's able to survive and when he returned to  Tokyo  he was promoted to major.  Now we are talking about the big battle of the Pacific War   between Japan and America.  Yamashihaka sent a large force to attack Pearl Harbor  and it was an overwhelming victory for the Americans.  But  it was very important to note that the Japanese never actually got on board the ships and took over the vessels.  The first  war with Japan  is still remembered to this day  and   is referred to as  the first   war   in the world.    When Japan defeated the Americans it was a  massive  glorious victory .    But that was it.  In  the Pacific  the Japanese were not able to take over the ships as they had a lot of ships destroyed.  It was the second war in  the  Pacific .  It wasn't until  1939   that Japan actually started attacking American ships again and they were more and more successful.  Japan was  a  powerful  nation but the Japanese Navy was not the best and not very well trained.  This is where the movie came from.  When the war ended the Americans were still very powerful and had the same navy that Japan did.  What happened after this war?  The American Navy was

It is a simple story about a man (Hank) and a dog (Hopps). The story itself is simple, but the characters are not. They are complex and interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so glad I saw this movie. I am a new mother and I was so impressed by this movie because I have a few friends who have children and I am not one of them and I would never have wanted a baby if I knew what it would look like with a kid in it. I was laughing out loud at the first act. The kids are so energetic and play so well with each other. I loved all the little moments with the characters.   I watched this with my daughters and they both loved it, so did the adults. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I recommend it to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie starts off with a nice scene that is quite enjoyable.   In the beginning of the movie, we find that the characters are having an adventure in a very different place.  A group of scientists are going on a journey to a remote and faraway planet, the planet is called Zobra. The planet is not only the home planet for the alien race called Zebra, but also an earthlike planet.  The story of the film is pretty much about the humans trying to get to the planet where the Zebrax are and to the bottom of the ocean.  In this film, we get some nice action scenes that are not to bad.  While the action is not to good, it is a good way to get the movie started.  One thing to note is that the Zibra have a very complex language.  So the movie does have a lot of scenes and action that requires a certain understanding of the Zubra language.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie that has been called a classic, a spiritual classic, and it's all of these things.    It's a movie of religious themes, spiritual themes, and of the spiritual world in general.  There's a very powerful message about the nature of evil in the world.  For some, it's a religion.  But for most people, it will be just another one of those great movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As good as a horror movie can be, the screenplay is about as dull as the rest of the movie. The pacing is absolutely appalling. This movie has absolutely no suspense or tension at all. What are they going to do when all of the "hundreds" of "hordes" of zombies are unleashed on the city? Well, they call up a helicopter to try and save them but the helicopter crashes into a building and the poor chopper is destroyed. The rest of them decide to run into the city to try to hide from the zombies and get out of there. They don't seem to be too careful though and most of them get killed or killed themselves and some even get impaled. This goes on for about ten minutes. I don't like horror movies that don't have much tension. If you are a fan of the genre then this should be a decent little movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw the trailer I was a little skeptical that this one was going to be good. The guy who plays "Johnny" is a nice guy who I believe is a good actor. When I first meet him I can't help but notice the way that he sits. He sits with his feet almost off the ground. Not a problem for me but I was never a fan of his type of sitting (unless he was doing a scene on a roof somewhere).    This movie is about the first time the boy meets Johnny, the father, and the boy discovers Johnny's talent for music.   The story is pretty interesting and when I think about it a little I think that this could be a nice little movie that everyone can enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I both had a blast at this movie. The story line was interesting and the characters were likeable. I liked how this movie was a bit like a "moody" comedy, without much plot line. The characters are great, the scenery is beautiful, and the music and voice acting was great. This movie was funny, dark, and sad, and had a good ending.   If you like the classic movies from the 1950s, this is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is based on a true story which occurred in the 80's and it is not a good story but the movie tries to be interesting by making the main character a little drunk and crazy. The movie also has a pretty good acting by a good cast including: Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Anthony Hopkins and William Shatner. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been fascinated with the mythology and the legends behind the "Cthulhu Mythos", especially the "Lovecraft Mythos".   It has never really been told so well.   The plot is a bit slow but you'll have to give it a second watch because you can see the big picture developing slowly from the beginning.  Also, this is an "original" horror/fantasy/adventure film with a different feel and story.  The film is more than just a scare tactic.  It's a fun, well-crafted, original, enjoyable, suspenseful, and intriguing film.  My only qualm is that the ending is rushed, but I suppose the movie is already running long enough.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film that does not contain any gore, or any gratuitous violence (I like to see it without any graphic violence). The movie deals with a family who is fighting their way out of poverty. The movie does not use a lot of soundtracks. The first scene that I saw was the opening of the movie. The music for that scene was very upbeat. This movie does a good job in showing the real life situation of the people who struggle to get out of this situation and to have a bright future. I am a fan of this movie, and if you are, then I recommend this movie for the family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's always nice to get an adaptation of a book that's not about murder, but more about a small town in the heart of the American Midwest.   "It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)"    This is a movie that has an awesome premise, but the execution can be a little weak.  The film follows a man named Ed Smith (played by a wonderful James Brolin) who goes to town to get a divorce.  When he returns, his estranged wife (Julie Delpy) is gone, and his young son (Michael Clarke Duncan) has vanished into thin air.  After trying to piece the disappearance together, Ed and his son find a letter sent to the house from a mysterious source.  It sounds like something from a John Grisham novel, but that doesn't stop the mystery being very well paced and intriguing.  Although it doesn't quite hit the mark, it is an entertaining movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't had a bad movie in a long time.   The story, the acting, the editing, the soundtrack, the pacing, it was all great.  The characters were interesting, the setting was interesting, and the ending was good.  There were no bad endings, I'm not saying that the ending in particular was bad, there were better endings out there, but the ending that I saw in the theatre made me smile, even though I was not too happy with how it ended, the movie does end on a good note.  I'm giving this movie a 2/5 stars because the writing isn't quite good enough to make a good story and the acting isn't great. However, the film was enjoyable and I enjoyed it, even if the acting in the movie wasn't what I expected. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie with my son last Friday night and it was one of the most emotional movies I have ever seen. The music was just incredible. It felt very like the movie was written and acted by a bunch of young people who didn't know what they were doing but were totally in love with it and wanted to make it a masterpiece. That being said, the movie is full of violence and the ending is just as bad as the rest of it. But, if you like to see a young couple who is struggling in the world and want to find love and a better life, then you might enjoy this movie. I just wish it had more emotional depth and if you think there are too many shots of the boys' bodies on the ground, then don't.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half is a good film, and it is not without its problems, but it is a great story with some fantastic performances.   This story is set in the 19th century, and has been filmed in a way that looks almost like a silent film.  The director, Brian De Palma, is a veteran of the film genre, and he takes a very good film that could have been great, and makes it great.  De Palmas is great in this film, he takes what could have made a great film, a great love story, and make it great, making it into something more.  This is an excellent film, it is also a story well told, that is not boring, which is great, I also liked that the story of the protagonist is not as simple as it could have, he has to go on with his life when his lover leaves him, so he takes the time to make a life for himself in an attempt to keep his lover, and the film follows his life very well, from the beginning to the end, it follows the events that occur in the time of love.  What makes the story great is that there is a lot of action, this is a classic De Palmma action film. The action is good, but not great, they do a nice job of showing it, but the action is not much more than it could be.  However, this film does do something that I have not seen in a film for a long time, and that is showing a man's life after he has loved someone, and as he starts to grow old and die, he makes a film about it, and tries to make his final journey good.  It is not good, the ending is not a nice end, but I thought it was a very well done film. One thing that I love about this film is that it follows a love triangle.  There are two lovers, one who has no idea of what to do after he leaves her, and one who is always looking for a woman he knows will change his life forever.  One thing about these two, both of them have a good personality, and both of these characters are well played by the characters in the film, particularly by De Palmania, who plays the two lovers very well.  They both have great voices, and are both able to communicate with one another, which makes the love triangle interesting.  I thought that this film was well done

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a woman who has been given up for adoption to a new family. She had an abusive husband, and they had a son, but after the divorce, he moved back home to the family farm. When she was 8 years old, the farm was destroyed by a tornado. The boy is a very nice boy and he is always with the family. The man that raised him was a very bad man. He is a violent and abusive man who keeps abusing his son and stealing his money. It would seem that they might as well kill him off so she could live on her own. He was always in a lot of fights with the boys. It turns out that there is a strange entity named L'Heureux-Lumiere who has created a new world. The new family has no money, but has a farm. One of the kids is a little kid called Ben. One day, Ben is sent off to his grandparents house. The old woman takes Ben and his brother to a strange place. He sees a whole bunch of things. One thing he can't get out of his head is that a little boy who was in the other world, L'heureux, is coming back. When L' Heureux is about to enter the body of Ben, he takes him back to his home. Ben is able to make a fire, but he can only go up to the attic. There is a room with the remains of a family that the boy left behind. There are skeletons all over the place. Ben's grandfather is there. The grandfather tells Ben that he didn't need to go back to the farm and it would be better for him to stay there in the world of the spirits and forget about the world on the farm. Ben knows that his parents were murdered. In the same place where the old woman is, the dead body of a little girl who was murdered also lies.   When the grandfather leaves, the child is frightened and runs into the woods. In a dream, he sees a beautiful woman. She is beautiful and she has blonde hair. He believes that she is L'Hérige. He looks at her with lust. She tells him to follow her. He runs to the edge of the cliff, but the woman is no longer there. When he comes back to reality, he finds that he has gone insane and has eaten all the trees in the woods and the ground as well.  (Note:

The film is based on an old novel, written by a well known writer of the time, Irenaus (Rudolf Abel), about an ancient family which lived for several generations at a castle in Germany.   I liked the movie a lot.  It is good, simple, but enjoyable.  I like it a lot!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The first half of The Red Shoes is so sad... it is like watching a very bad episode of "Gilligan's Island" for the first few minutes. Then, things go a lot better and there is a very real feeling of family here. My favorite part of the movie is the song 'Heaven's on Fire' which is so beautifully done by the lovely Mireille Valmont. It is just pure joy to watch a woman overcome her fear and learn to love the life of a biker and be happy... all the while, a child is being raped in her home! The best part of this movie is this amazing ending where a little boy is taken away by the police, then he meets a nice old guy who tells him all about life... the mother and son in the restaurant are in trouble, the child is crying and all the family is there with the police to take the child away... what is happening in this movie? Is it a fantasy?

It was very well done, and it was about a high school football player who has to deal with some bullying in his team, as well as some stuff from his mother. I do not think I could have handled all that stuff. But I found this movie pretty interesting. A very well acted movie that is about a guy who is a little different than everyone else.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a fan of horror movies, but I love how well this movie has been made by the same people who made House. I've seen the film at a number of festivals, and it's really one of the better horror films I've ever seen. The movie is about a family that gets caught up in the occult activities that surround a group of occultists. I love the way the movie handles the occult. They use real people to portray these supernatural events, and I like how they portrayed it. I also really liked how they were portrayed as if they were a bunch of average Joe's. I don't know how I would feel about people with a dark past. That would bother me, and this is a good horror film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie stars: Brad Dourif - an American tourist (a little over-qualified) is travelling around the world with his wife for the month of June. This is a film that is not without its flaws but I thought the acting was good and the plot was pretty intriguing. The film has a slight "weirdness" about it but not in a bad way. As an American Brad is definitely used to some weirdness and as far as the film goes his "weIRDness" only helps to give a sense of atmosphere to the film. The story takes place on an island where an English couple are being attacked by some strange looking creatures. They get away and run across a small group of other strange looking people. When the English couple arrive back they find their luggage has been destroyed. The English woman thinks she is going mad and Brad (our protagonist) thinks they might be some kind of religious group. When she meets up with the other strange people and they try to kill them they get some help from a couple who are really into their faith and who have an interesting history with a couple in England. In this strange film the characters all have very strange ways of communicating with each other and the way in which the island is presented is a nice touch. The characters are a mixture of real people and some of the stranger looking characters you may not think is real.   I also liked that the main character was a little overqualified and Brad seemed to like the tourist aspect of the trip.

This is a film about a thief who is in jail in the first place. The story about the thief is actually a lot more interesting and interesting that the whole plot of the movie. It's a fun little movie.  The film "Laughing Boy" is a hilarious comedy about a young boy who has a very bad reputation. At one point the boy is walking down the street when the bad boy walks past him. The boy gets so mad he throws the bad man down the stairs and then runs away with the ball.

It is a true "Star Trek" epic, with a lot of action scenes, a cool and powerful ending and it will entertain the whole family.   I was really surprised at the time I saw this. The whole story is about a starship from 20 years in the future, in a planet where it is possible to live in a virtual reality. There are people who, thanks to the technology created by a scientist, have all their desires fulfilled and live in the same kind of world we do in today. These people have to learn to accept their "new life".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot is rather good, the film is about an ex-CIA operative who is tasked with trying to find out who murdered the Russian Ambassador to a country with which he has a close personal friendship. The movie doesn't quite do all the things it sets out to do (a bit too much focus on the murder and not enough on the character development) but it's still a very enjoyable and compelling flick.   The soundtrack for this movie is phenomenal. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very good movie. It has a plot about a kid who is afraid to play the saxophone because he is not a very handsome child, yet when he is in a musical competition he becomes very handsome. He meets a man named Dr. Robert F. Kennedy and together they try to discover the identity of a woman called "Miss Sultana". He eventually finds her and they get married. After they have a daughter and move to a small town in the Midwest (where is the movie set) he has a stroke. The next day the town is visited by the evil witch "The Witch of the West". The evil witch wants to steal a heart from Miss Sultanas and turns everyone evil, including Miss Sordana.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is very well executed.   This film contains a good balance of humor, drama and romance.  There are some strong female roles and one of the strongest male characters.  I have nothing bad to say about this film and will recommend it to anyone who likes good cinema and likes movies with a strong story line.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would describe this movie as a romantic comedy/fairy tale that has a dash of horror thrown into it.  The story is about a girl named Mab who moves to the town of Amazia to get away from her family and has to deal with the curse of a local monster. The story starts out pretty simple but then we find out that the "Amazia" is actually a place full of death, and it's the only way Mab can get away.  As you will see later on in the movie, this town is not as safe as it seems.   Once Mab gets past her family's death threats, she makes a pact with a dark magic to survive and find a way back home.  Mab, however, doesn't go far. The curse that was cast by the monster, and the lack of people who know about it, keep her from finding her way back.  After a while, the film ends. I think it would be a good idea to start again with a new story line, though, just to see if the curse is stronger than the town. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found myself completely impressed by this movie and I was also interested in watching it. It is quite well done and I found it well acted in all respects. I am quite surprised how a simple movie of two people falling from a very high and very well built platform and flying off was a wonderful experience. It would have been a masterpiece if it wasn't for the bad acting (I think most of the acting was very poor) the stupid music and stupid CGI of a flying machine (not much CGI, but rather the use of a moving platform on a moving train), which I believe was so bad that I thought this movie was actually made by an elementary school. I was impressed with the writing and all other aspects and I have never seen such a fun movie in a long time.

I think there are a lot of movie fans out there who would enjoy this movie as much as I did.

This movie has a little of everything to make it great.  The story is well done with a good pace and some well thought out characters.  There are times when this film feels a little silly and silly and sometimes it is.  It is a good looking movie with beautiful photography.  This film would be a great one to watch in the evening or on a lazy day.  I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in good movies.

It has great actors. The movie has some good acting. The special effects were cool. There was no sound effects in the film and it was scary. The story is the same as the old TV horror show. The actors were good too. The ending was really bad. The guy is never seen again. There is no sequel to this movie. This movie was a fun watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very enjoyable movie. The story is good, and the characters are nice. I had no idea what the plot would be, but it kept me interested. There were some pretty good jokes in this film. The only problem I had was with some of the special effects. They didn't look right and weren't all that convincing. I think the special effect should have been done in 3-D. I found this to be a good popcorn movie, with the actors doing a good job. I would like to see the film in 3D and more interesting special effects, but overall this was a fun movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   . I had forgotten that the story of "The Man Who Never Was" was inspired by the fact that this was the last movie in a series of them, starring James Earl Jones.     And yes, the director, William Friedkin, is a real legend and a true American.  In a way, this is his first real American-made film.  He has made several good pictures about the Mafia, but this one seems to be about the CIA rather than the Mafia.  The movie's plot is so much more interesting than it could have been.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more of James Earl, who is played by a good guy, Vincent Price, but I like the characters anyway.  For a start, there is a young man, who seems to have been turned into a vegetable, called "The Tall Man."  He looks like he could easily be a real "Man Who Never WAS."  In fact, this film is the basis for a good story of how the man never was was.  There are a few scenes where I couldn't help but imagine Jones himself trying to come to terms with his own immortality.  And when I say "The Story of The Man Who Would Not Be," I really mean a story of a man who had been turned human.  When the film starts, there seems to only be one "Man."   There is a woman (played by Patricia Neal) who lives near a big, empty building in an industrial area of the city.  It is supposed to be empty at all times, but at night when the lights are switched off, the empty building begins to grow alive.  On the night it first begins to happen, The Man (played as an older, balding man) arrives and goes up to the empty house to sleep, but soon finds himself being watched.  Before the man knows it, he finds a strange woman (Jane Fonda) trying to sleep on his bed.  Fonda is played as a woman who is very much aware that something is wrong with her.  She is wearing an orange shirt with a blue collar that shows that she worked as a waitress in a very important restaurant.  With her are two men, one of whom is played brilliantly by John Garfield (who would have made a good James Earl) and the other played by James Garner.  But this movie is really more than just a re-telling of The Last Man in

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... I have seen a number of bad films.   Some are just bad. .  A lot of the things that were said about this movie did not make much sense.  When I went to the theater there were two people who were telling me a lot about the movie and I did not understand a word that they were saying.  In the end I did like it.  I have never seen a movie that scared me more than this one.  The story is not that good but it is an interesting story about the little girl and how she found a strange doll and became attached to it.       The movie is all about how a strange girl in a strange house, and a little doll.       It is interesting.  It is not what I expected.  But at least you got an interesting movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had seen a few different documentaries and documentaries on the subject of Bigfoot, and I never got to the bottom of it. I've been looking for years and never found anything. I thought I was doing something right, so when I saw this, I thought, "Well, I may just be lucky enough to get a glimpse of this beast someday." This is a little different than my other reviews. This is an interview with an actual member of the Bigfoot community, and this is the real deal, not a few reenactments. This isn't an attempt to debunk the story, this is about how the community has actually lived their lives. The members have all gone through some form of hell, and they're very open and honest about it. Their stories are sad, but true. There is also a bit of a story in the first few minutes of this film, that doesn't appear in the actual documentary. The interview is very entertaining and I hope you will enjoy it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . You don't even need to read it to get the gist of it: the hero is a normal guy who has just moved to a new town where people seem very strange. He's in a relationship with a beautiful girl, and he's a very good friend to her. But at the start of the movie he goes missing, only to be found the next day by an old man who is about to die. That old man tells the hero he will need his help in solving a series of bizarre murders and he asks if the hero will help him. The two are inseparable, but things go awry when a serial killer strikes.   The movie starts out strong but it's actually a bit muddled in the end.  The acting is top-notch, but I felt there was a bit of a wasted opportunity in the first half. The ending is pretty interesting, but there's a lot of stuff that isn't necessary to the plot: some of the dialogue can be pretty stupid at times.  I was also a bit bored by the movie.  This isn't a bad movie, but it definitely isn't worth the time it would take to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like this movie. It was really weird seeing this movie like 5 years ago. I just liked it so much at first and then once it was finished I realized that this movie really is the real deal. The main reason I liked this movie is the acting. When you have a movie about a guy going to a bar to pick up a girl and he starts to have a girl he really doesn't like try to hit on him and try to kiss him she looks so hot. Then when he does get a girl to go on a date with him she is super hot. Even if the main thing is the "dating" and the "dancing" the movies main thing was the acting by the leads. They acted so well together and they had so much chemistry. It really is a movie you can watch all weekend. It is not too long and there is a lot of good sex scenes. There are even a couple of times when the sex was so hot I thought the guys could never make it up to her. It got to a point where I could not tell who was the male and who was female. I had to watch 3 times to see who the male was, it was so cool to see the two of them in such a natural and sexual way. I really wanted more. I could watch this movie all the time. I hope you like it and if you do go out and watch it.

That's the only reason.   This is a good scene.  The women are very smart.  They are talking about men and they are talking with a great sense of humor.  I wish I could remember everything about it.  If you like this scene,  try to watch a scene in this movie.  But you can only catch a glimpse of it. The picture is good enough.  There is a nice woman here.  And here is another nice man.  Nice guys and nice women.  These are the people who are supposed to be happy.

It's not perfect, but it's also not bad by any means. It has its ups and downs, and there's a lot of really great moments in the film, but the whole film is still incredibly short. The cast is excellent, and the story line is solid enough to carry a movie. I don't think there's anything this film does that's not done better in other movies out there. It doesn't break the mold of a good action flick, but rather, it just works as a great action flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, the film is called " The Dictator." Not to be confused with " The Emperor's New Clothes," or any other movie about a dictator. "The Dictators" is about a German Jewish businessman who manages to get himself to the United States. The guy doesn't seem to fit the mold of a German Jew; he's tall, white, and blond. He's also a self-proclaimed Nazi and his personal secretary is a blonde American named Rose. There is no love between the two of them and neither of them seems to have much respect for the other. Then there's the fact that the German government is after him for money and they have to take a bribe to let him off the hook. At first he goes along with it to avoid being arrested and he even has a chance to tell Rose he has money in a safe deposit box. Then he finds out about the safe deposit boxes and the police get involved.   I have been in that state of "dissapointment" about almost every movie I have seen with a lead character who wants to make a life for himself somewhere else and has no trouble doing it. I was so looking forward to this film. The only thing I was not expecting was how good it would be. I had expected a fairly normal movie and not a political movie, but I was surprised at how good this was. The cast is all very well balanced and their voices were perfect for each of the characters. I didn't expect to be in such a good mood as I was, but the movie is very good and I am very glad I saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "When an Englishwoman and an Irishman meet in London, their journey is bound to become a far cry from what the lovers expected and a farce from what could have been. "   (from The Daily Telegraph, February 18, 1982) The only thing that was missing from this movie is a scene where the two of them were having a quiet moment with each other...  ...But that doesn't mean the film didn't have its moments of humor!   This is a good example of a movie about two characters, the girl who wants to be in love with the guy, the guy who does not understand why she wants him, and the two characters trying to get each other to do what they want.   The story doesn't really make a big impression on me, but it's not the main point of the movie so I'll just mention a few highlights: - The ending;   It's just so sad how they've become enemies and they just want to live the same life and have fun. - The scene in the bar;  The guy gets an order from the girl: "I want a nice cup of tea."   She tells him that she has no tea left in her room.  It turns out that the guy is a millionaire and buys all kinds of tea just like that. He buys a small cup and hands it to her. He says that she shouldn't drink it and that she should taste it. He then says that he's going to have another drink for her if she can get him another one.  He then takes her to the restaurant in his car.  Then he shows her another cup and she drinks it.  The girl then asks: "Are you saying you love me?" The guy says: "Yes, I love you."  When they get back home, they begin to enjoy each other again.  They sit at the table and start drinking tea.  After a while, they take off their clothes.  When he begins to go to sleep, he's still dressed.  "My legs were so wet," says the guy.  In the movie, it seems like the girl is in love, and in fact the whole movie is about her trying to discover who the guy really is.  There are two more scenes in this movie that are pretty funny:  - One where the girl gets a little cockroach stuck in her ear.  - Another where a guy in a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been a fan of the Indiana Jones films since I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1977.   As a film student at the time, I took the train to New York, waited in the long, long, dark, wet, sweaty car for 30 minutes, and sat through a second screening.  It was then that I realized what a great, great movie this was.  The story was excellent.  Indy was in real trouble and the audience knew that because the film followed his adventures while he was trying to escape from them.  If it wasn't for a little, tiny mistake, this would have been a brilliant film.  This movie was full of action, suspense, adventure, and wonderful humor.  With a little editing and some nice dialogue, I would rate it higher than the previous two films.  My one criticism is the final scene in which Indy and Marion are caught in a cave.  There is a small moment where Marion asks Indy, "Who are you?"  She then asks him, "Why are you in here?"  Indy responds with a simple, "I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time."  It takes away from the final moments, and leaves the audience with a somewhat negative taste in their mouths.  In any case, this movie is a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a film that you don't want to miss.   You know what that means:  A solid action movie with very entertaining special effects.  In one way I'm disappointed, since I was expecting an action movie like a lot of other films. The way in which the films plot gets tangled up is not a good way to go about it. This could have been a pretty good movie if a few things were better in it.  Overall a great action flick and a very entertaining ride.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never been to the U.S. and I did not know about the "Big Daddy" movie (I saw it when I was in 7th grade), but it is a fun flick. I always enjoyed movies and the only thing that annoyed me was the character's names were all the same, like the movie. The guy that plays the "punky" one is named "Johnny" which is the same name that I had in 7 th grade. The actor I think is called "Johnny Pussy" I never saw his movie so I do not know. The other one I liked is the guy that is the "fairy" or "witch" one. This one is the only guy that I think can be a bad guy. The ending is very good and when it was done I knew that the film was over. I did find the music and the movie was pretty, but it was a little too long to be funny.   The story goes like this, a man named Jim wants a big, muscular man to go around his neighborhood and fight the bad guys. He can only find a very little man named "Big Jim" who is the punky one. They fight and the panky one dies in the end, but Jim is still happy and the big guy is in jail for a good long time.  I love the big, bad guys and this one did not disappoint.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like this movie and like a lot of the other movies i see out there. But the acting is very very bad at times. If you really wanna be shocked or get a shock you should not watch this movie. There are many reasons why I can't say it is really good. Maybe it's the acting that is a problem. Some of the characters seem like caricatures and some of them seem very like characters of the 90s. But I would say it could be entertaining if it was done like a movie but at times it just feels off and the acting can be very bad and just plain weird and very cheesy. I give this movie a B.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure if I was at first attracted to this movie because of the "fancy" costumes or because of it's bizarre plot (like a cross between The Little Rascals and A Bug's Life ) but when it came time to actually go watch it I was surprised at the movie itself!   This movie is pretty much a story of a poor boy named Ben (who is actually an adult in a children's show) who was left to be taken care of by a crazy woman named Madame Zerelda (an older lady) and her dog (who actually turns out to be a dog but really does look like a pig - I have no idea why) - both these women make the boy their "favorite" and Ben has a little problem with these two.   The movie is based on a childrens show that was aired from 1940 to 1946.  This show, which was called "Goonies", was about a group of small, goofy looking people and it really shows!  There are tons of weird characters in this movie and they are all funny and have to work very hard to make themselves look like something other than what they are.  I like that this movie is mostly silent so you can concentrate on the characters and the acting of each one of them.  It's not an amazing movie but I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a remake of a movie called 'The Thing' that is an 80's classic. The movie was released in 1988 and starred Kevin Costner. He was playing a scientist that was trying to create a way to turn the human into a kind of monster and it was a huge success.   The movie is about a scientist working for a company who has a creature and it starts attacking him.  A big chunk of the film is a car chase.  After he was attacked by a huge creature, a couple of other creatures attacked him but it turns out they were actually his creations. He made them go around the country so he could watch them.

We can make your death a little easier, but the time will come that we must part from you, because there is no way to escape the law of gravity, for there is neither place nor time in which we can live."  So one morning when the boy was playing on his little ranch a thunderstorm rolled in. The heavens seemed to be a great big big black hole, and all the stars vanished. All the angels vanished, too, and the children were left in a strange place, where the hills were all made of ice and the trees were all covered in ice.  "The lightning flashed like lightning. The rain beat on the house. The wind blew through the open door like the wind through a box of matches, and there was no sound whatever.  But he stood there waiting, as if he might suddenly be called out.  And in the darkness there came the thunder, a thunder that shook the whole earth. And that night when the sky darkened and the rain began to pour down upon the earth, that boy stood there and he waited, waiting for something to happen, something to show the lightning, show him the lightning and tell him the story of the great flood. And he waited until all through the darkness a lightning flashed through the sky, and it struck a little hole in the cloud, and a little voice said,   "He's waiting."   In the little white room the light flashed on, and that boy looked down on himself. He looked up, down, up, and then he sat down and he cried.  His mother came in and she sat down too and she said, and she reached out and she took him and
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always wanted to watch a John Carpenter movie. He's an American composer, and the film's story is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick. I think it's an interesting tale, and I always liked Carpenter's films. I also liked the characters. The plot's plot twist is very unique.   It is a strange movie. I don't remember too many plots which are like that, but it makes sense and is a good story.     I love to see good movies. This movie was good!   - July 10, 2004I'll be watching the sequel: "Memento" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie before I started watching The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, so it was a new experience. It made me laugh out loud! The story was excellent! The whole movie is about Walter Mincey and the crazy person he is. He has all these problems with his dad and also with the people around him. The ending was very good! I'm so glad I watched it! I'd watch this movie over and over again!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the movie "Saving Face" it is clear to me that the director has an obsession with this scene. The scene is a parody of a love story. A woman's lover gets lost and has to be rescued by an old hag. The old woman is a very beautiful woman and the scene was very well done.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie I did not like when I first watched it was The Rocketeer. It was about a kid named Rocketeers who fly planes.   The movie is very dull, just flying around and doing some stunts.  As a kid I couldn't get into it, but as I got older I started liking it and now I like it very much.  I don't know how I came across this, but I'm glad I did! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those that have never seen a "Wicked Witch of the West", this one will be a treat!   It has all the elements that makes a great movie.   The Witch is a really good witch. She has a wicked and wicked ways.  She gets up in the morning at seven o'clock.  Then she goes to the graveyard and gets ready to burn the wicked witches down.  The witch tries to make a deal with a young girl who says she will marry the Witch if the Witch gives her a hundred dollar.  And the Witch agrees.  Once the young girl has the hundred dollar the witch starts to burn houses.  So the girl comes in, the witch is waiting for her.  As the girl is trying to get into the house, the old man walks in.  A big fight takes place in the house and it takes two weeks for the witch to get out.  It's hard to believe that all this has gone on for two weeks.  All this has happened because the young man was looking for a bride for his young daughter.  This was one of the few things about the movie that was original.  There is a real sense of excitement and adventure in this movie.     This movie was very popular in the 1960s when it was released.  Now the movie is a bit dated.  One of the problems is that the characters look old.  Also the actors are not really good at it.  But overall, this movie was good and has a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie about the life of an African-American who goes to the United States to study at Harvard University. This movie shows how racism is so strong in America.   This movie should have been made in the 1950's, because today's movie is like a throwback. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie looks like a high-budgeted TV mini-series and sounds like a sitcom.   It's basically a bunch of people living in a small town in the woods when one of them takes a vacation to the nearby beach town, only to find that the beach has been closed down and that no one knows where the town is.  The people in town aren't exactly the nicest, and the lead boy (who is the only male, and who isn't very smart) is a lot smarter than the other kids, but he has to deal with the girl's parents and his dad's attitude.    The film is very silly, and you can tell a lot of effort has been put into it.  It certainly looks like it.     My main issue is with the ending.  There's a couple of scenes in the beach town that are pretty well done, but I was annoyed at the end of the movie that the kid who took the vacation doesn't even bother to call his parents.  That's an odd move, especially because he should have at least called the teacher at the school, who is supposed to be his friend, but the kid didn't bother to tell his dad he went on a vacation.  I would have appreciated a little more closure, but at least the kids are out of the woods. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing is this: In a way, these movies (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, etc.) have a certain style and a certain feel about them that the movies in the same genre usually don't have. The Hobbit is a fun and exciting film. I was very much looking forward to seeing this in the cinema. The acting is really good and it's hard to say if you'll like a particular actor or not, but if you're a Tolkien fan (or even a casual fan) then it's a great movie. It's a very enjoyable movie with a great cast and it feels like a much-needed movie to get people used to a new trilogy with new stories. It does feel like a Tolkien movie as much as it does a Lord of The Rings movie. The dialogue is very nice and the acting is well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "For a film that's supposedly about a 'feral' species (think leopard geckos), it's quite the opposite.   This is one of the more unusual, yet entertaining and, frankly, surprising film I've seen recently."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw the original film and loved it and thought it was an excellent retelling of the story of the Book of Genesis with the same set of characters but the actors who play the characters are so good I almost didn't care who they played.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of this movie is pretty much perfect. It's a good film and the writing is good. In the middle the characters are pretty generic and the movie suffers from the main characters tendency to act stupid and it would be better if they were more in depth and more likable. But the movie gets a little bit too much of a bad rap in the ending.   Overall a very good movie, well written and very enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most popular movie franchises of all time. The movie was released in the year 1991 and its a story about the adventures of a boy and his dragon. It's very similar to the movie "Journey to the Center of the Earth" and it's a beautiful picture. It was directed by Stanley Kubrick who is a legend in the movie world and he put a lot of effort in making a movie which is very enjoyable. The story is very similar as the movie  "Jawbreaker"   and I recommend the movie as a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I had heard a little about this movie from my cousin. She had heard about it from her friends. I really love to read books that deal with magic and mysticism. The story is great. I think it's a great watch!   I really enjoyed this movie! I didn't find it hard to follow but I think the writing and acting of the cast did a good job. I loved the character of Ben and how he had that "bad ass" attitude. And I really liked the cast as well.   The plot was awesome. The action scenes were awesome. I wish we had more to the movie. Maybe it was all about the magic but it was so cool to see such a great actor in a magic role! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie, which was released in the United States by MGM, features the role of a former baseball player who was convicted of raping a 16 year-old girl in the late 1940s.   The movie, as the title of the film would suggest, portrays the events surrounding the rape.  After the rape, the girl was returned to her mother to be comforted.  The mother then made sure that the child was taken home, and the mother left.  This is where the movie starts.  Before the rape occurred, the mother and child were in a car.  It was later discovered that the boy was in a room with the mother, who was sleeping with him.  During the rape the boy, who is a catcher for the Milwaukee Braves, would say, "Leave me alone. I don't want to be with you."  There were no witnesses.  Both the mother's and the child's clothing were never found after the rape but the boy who was the victim has said that he and the victim's mother did not see each other when they left the house after the sexual assault.  There is a picture of the mother kissing the boy and saying, "We will not see again."  The boy's mother is found dead shortly after the abduction.  Despite the fact that she was a minor at the time of the rape and her mother's death, no charges were filed in the case.  In 1998, after the movie was released, a man was arrested for the rape of a 16-year-old boy at his home and was sentenced to death.  For that reason, this was a very difficult film for some people to watch.  However, it was one of those "it just happened" movies.  Some people have suggested that the movie does have a moral, although it may not be one that was shared by all the people who saw it.  I felt that the film did not have an "I feel" message.  When the boy said to the mother "I don't know how to feel." she said, "When you come back home."   However the fact is that a "feel" message was never a central message of this movie.  To end: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a fun comedy in a low budget way. They're kids, that's all you need to know, except that it isn't easy being a kid in a candy store like Candyland! But if you like your films to be funny, that doesn't mean you have to like it, in fact it's not like a candy shop. It's fun, it's got great characters and is a nice little movie with a small budget.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a classic movie about a man whose life falls apart when his wife dumps him for another man.   While watching this film there is a lot of heart that is in every scene and every frame.  This film has an excellent lead actor in a great role of a man who is the most loyal man you will ever meet.  He will go to any lengths to make his wife happy.  A truly great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of Star Wars, I've watched all 6 movies over and over. This movie is very different from the other Star Wars movies. I was very surprised by how different the characters were. Not sure why, but this movie is more fun. I had a blast.    Darth Vader is the best character of all time! This movie gets points for the story, and the story is excellent. The best movie of the series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this was a pretty decent movie. The movie was all about the young guy (I think it was a guy but I forget) who lived in a house that was like an apartment but the thing was he had to sleep on a bed and he had a bed in the middle of the bed and the girl had a big bed on one side of the room and his brother on the other and a big table with some food that was there as well. It's a nice place to be a kid. He had a great time with his friends that lived there and had an apartment for his brother to stay in and they had a movie theater too. We also got to see some good looking girls in there and they got the girl to be in a bikini one time. We got to play a game with them and we had a ball game at the end but the guy wasn't in the game but he was in the bathroom which was all over. It was nice to see the girl get into the game and get a little sexy with them.   The one problem with this movie is that it is about 2 people in a small apartment so if you have a bigger apartment then it would be great. I have only seen this movie about 5 times but it was good enough to keep me going. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hi! I really like this movie. It is not a horror, but a story about a young woman who can see the things. It's really interesting.   The story starts with the mother of an 8 year old girl who was born with a birth defect: she can see everything. But she does not like that she sees things and wants to go to the doctors. So she is sent to a special school where she will receive education. But her mother was kidnapped from her home, her uncle was killed. When she was born her mother promised her not to be a mother, but she was so weak that she could not even hold the baby. So her mother sold the baby and the child to a doctor who was a strange man. He looked like a vampire. But he did not hurt her, he just wanted to know what she sees.

They have a patient that is suffering from a lot of pain. In one day he goes in to have his shoulder healed and he becomes a super zombie. He goes around killing all the nurses, doctors and patients. It's a great way to make people believe that what they are seeing is real.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is set in a future where a robot named Nux has been made of metal. He goes to a carnival to play, but gets lost and ends up getting eaten by the animals. He comes to life again, and is taken in by a robot lady, called Nessa. His new life in the world of metal is not going too well, but he still has his good looks, and a great sense of humor. The way the movie is shot is very interesting, because you really do see the robots.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had not seen any of the recent movies about David Bowie that I have seen. I was very surprised to see that he is still an icon. His music still sounds the same and has a special place in the hearts of fans. It has become more than a fashion and a style, it is a message.   This movie is about a group of singers. They all love David Bowie and they all know who he is. There is a girl named Tina who is only 14 years old and she is very shy. She has a crush on David and she wants to make a song about him. There are other girls who want to be him too. It is the end of the year so that is the place for him to perform. He shows up at a show and does a song which gives everyone goosebumps.  The girl Tina does her thing and sings his song.  This song is very sad and romantic. It shows how good of a singer David is.  He is also quite funny as he does a whole stage routine. It was hard to watch and it was like a cross between a rock and a roll concert.  David Bowie does a lot of amazing things on stage and he shows his love for the audience. At the end he is like a rock star.

But, the film gradually picks up the pace and we start to see more of the story, and there is some really good acting from everyone involved.   The ending is very emotional, even if it is a little predictable, and it is nice to see that so many people seem to enjoy this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw The Matrix in a tiny theater about ten miles from where I live, and I've seen The Matrix 3 times since it came out. In that time, I've grown to appreciate the complexity of the narrative, and the plot has only grown more complex. The Matrix is a deeply thoughtful movie about the nature of reality, and how we cope with it. It's a movie that makes the audience realize how much we're able to manipulate reality just by thinking about it, and that's the key to understanding why the characters in the Matrix are so insistent on fighting for their right to live.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about an American family in the 19th century. The main character is a poor Irishman who makes a living on the docks of Baltimore. He is married and has four children and one daughter who is named Edith. Edith is a quiet and gentle little girl who loves to be in her parents house. It is her brother who has been sent away to Europe. When he comes back he has a job as a dockman in Europe. Edie tries to make herself more useful by trying to make him a good man. She helps him with his work. It doesn't work. The brothers quarrel over money and who is to blame for things. When the elder brother falls ill, Edith takes it upon herself to get some money from his widow. This is the start of their struggle for survival and they eventually start fighting to the death. This was very good movie. It was made in the early 1900's. There were a lot of old-time movies in those days, so there were a couple of good ones. It looks like this one would have been good, too. It isn't perfect, but it's still good and a good story about a couple who try to survive in a world that seems to be getting worse and worse. I liked it, it's good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My boyfriend and I had a wonderful night out at our favorite Irish pub. We were very fortunate to find a spot close by that we could easily get to. It was a very relaxing and friendly place and the drinks were very reasonable. We ordered the corned beef hash and the corriander sauce. I liked both and would definitely go back! The corrianders were definitely a good idea but the hash was a little too weak. The corned was excellent and was the best corned I have ever had. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to try some Irish food.

The soundtrack is wonderful and the characters sound like real kids in a candy store.

If you like a great sci fi or just a great action movie with lots of explosions and explosions go see this movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So my buddy wanted to go to the movies with me so we decided to go see "The Great Mouse Detective" with some other friends. He was telling me about how great it was and then I asked him if we could go there next Friday and he said yes. This was Friday so we went out and saw it. As I mentioned in the beginning the movie was awesome and I can honestly say that I didn't know there was any type of mouse involved in this movie. I think my friend thought the mouse was supposed to be "Gabe" but I think that's a pretty big coincidence. It was a pretty small theater with a large screen and the movie played a few times. I don't know if I would want to go back though. I enjoyed it a lot and if I had to describe it I would say that it was like a kid with a lot of friends playing catch with a balloon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of  The Little Prince   (1972)     is a classic tale of innocence, naivety and compassion.   An elderly man falls in love with a tiny boy who happens to be the reincarnation of his wife.  When they first meet, the little boy is frightened and timid.  But the little prince soon finds his own courage as he grows up.     And there's a great scene at the end of the movie when the little   boy becomes a prince and takes off with the elderly man in a balloon !   For the last fifteen minutes of the film, you get a nice mix of the classic Prince Hans Christian Andersen story and the classic Disney movie,   with a dash of The Wizard of Oz.   This is a Disney classic.  I hope we will see a whole new Disney movie of this type one day!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film does a fantastic job at showcasing the dangers and hardships of the American frontier.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well it's a pretty bad movie and a pretty long movie and I loved it. I felt that some of the best stuff came out of the beginning and the end of the movie and it didn't start too great with the first movie and then kind of slowly went downhill. The ending was so bizarre that I thought it was a very funny movie but I couldn't really see anything funny. The movie was a really good one. It has its good moments and its bad and it makes you wonder what could have been the movie in the movie if it had been completed a little later. There are some good effects and the first one was great and had some nice effects. The second one had some cool and strange looking things in it and the third one just had a weird scene in it, which made it look like a stupid movie. Well I guess if you like a good bad movie you might like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a child, I thought the movie was called The Little Mermaid because of a line: "What are you? A mermaid?" - which I thought was strange. But this movie has such great animation (and I haven't seen the original), and the movie itself is great! The movie has this kind of old world feel to it: I'm not talking about the costumes or the mermaids, but I'm talking about all the old things that I grew up with: old toys, old movies (I always thought that the movie had the same style of animation as The Flintstones and The Three Stooges), and all kinds of songs. It's really good!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would recommend this film to people who want to watch a really good movie. It's a great action flick that can only be described as "unforgettable". It's amazing how the plot never falters and never gets old. I love how the story is really well thought out and that it manages to combine the best of 90s action/sci-fi and 80s cop films in a good way. I was surprised to see that this is really a film that is well loved by both kids and adults.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie. I loved the idea that a guy comes up with a plan to take down a gang of thugs in the middle of the woods and then goes on a quest to do it. I always thought that the whole story was a big waste of time because no one comes out of it alive. But not this time. The man who did the job comes out alive but his friends and family do not. So I guess it isn't much different from that guy coming up with the plan. It also was a bit funny. At one point the guy talks about the movie "A Clockwork Orange" but there was a scene that was similar to "The Blues" in "A Boy Named Charlie". Then when the man was talking about the gun he kept going back and forth between saying that he had to get the gun or that it was going to be a short story but it had to end soon because he couldn't be late to a party. So the gunslinger was right and it ended too soon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been wanting to see this movie for many years and finally it is here.   What a funny and original movie this is.  I had a hard time believing in my heart that I was watching a comedy.  There is a real laugh fest going on in here and I love that.  The movie has a lot of surprises and I think some of them are not in the movie, but rather in the director's mind.  It is a comedy that really hits a nerve.  When I was in high school I watched many of the Saturday morning cartoons in the 80s and 90s and I have always wanted to be a part of a live action " Saturday morning cartoon."  This is one of those live action cartoon "Saturday morning cartoons" that I really like to watch.  And that is a fact. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a small role in this film and it did not disappoint. This is a great film, and a must watch if you like your films more violent. It's a good old fashioned Western that is set during the American Civil War. It has a unique atmosphere and looks really pretty.   It's not one of the very first movies to use the wide open camera like in Gone With the Wind and it's also not one to be overlooked in your history books. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      This movie does not have anything to do with me. It is a film about a family in the American south who had a hard time coping with death in their life. The wife is the mother to a daughter and a son. The daughter was having a hard life, it was hard for her to make a living in the cotton fields. So they took a young man who could work in the fields and he taught her how to read and write. It was a very hard life. This boy had been in a hard labor camp when he was young. He didn't like his life there. So he joined up with a bunch of white guys who would get him drunk and they would take him back to the cotton field. It didn't last long. He said that when he got out of that camp, they didn't have cotton anymore. They had a lot of land, but there was no crop. That's the last they ever had. He had to work the cotton out of the land and sell it. He learned to read but he was never very good. His father died when he went to work and left him all the money. The father was a good man and the wife was pretty well off. The movie was very moving and a nice story. I'm glad I was a little younger then to see this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is based on a novel by  John Christopher,  a great author who worked on the BBC and in films with the likes of C-Span.      He is writing about a girl, Mary, who is going to a small town in England to be with her fiancé, John.  One day, she meets a very handsome and dangerous man, called John. He was a man who, though not rich, had a large house, a well paid job and all of the   things a man wants.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film opens with a large explosion and a woman being dragged by the hair by a large dog. We then see a police officer talking to a man with a very large scar on his head and a very small scar on one arm. He is also wearing a large shirt that covers his arms. He tells him that it is only a flesh wound but this guy is going to be in trouble. The man tells the officer about his "family". The man is a carpenter and also a farmer. The two are traveling on a road and we hear a loud thump, a loud sound, and then a woman screaming in pain. She has a large belly wound. The carpenter says that she would have been fine if it was not for the dog. The dog is a large African Spaniel. The other man says that he has a wife and a little daughter, but they are on their way back to their village. The woman, however, was pregnant when she was attacked. He says that if he did not come to help her he would be a murderer and a thief. The police officer asks the woman if she wants anything. She gets up and leaves the house. The men return to the house and they find a dead woman. They take the dog away and say that they will not return for a long time. The women comes back to the village and finds her husband dead from his wound. Her husband has been attacked by a stray dog and bitten all over his body. She tells the men that she has killed a dog. She thinks that the dog is coming for a blood meal. She runs back to her house and kills the dog by breaking its neck with a stick. We are then given a montage of the various characters. They have all met before. The wife and the husband and the farmer and the carpenter are all traveling in a car and have made their way to their small village. There are a few other men along with the carpenters and the women and the men from the other villages. We learn that some of the women in the village are pregnant. We get to hear more about the village from the farmer, the car mechanic, and the dog catcher. The animal catcher tells us that they are going to kill the dog because it is in the way of the grain that the men will be picking up. They are going on a hunt for the animal. The hunter will be a hunter of the animals. He will be using his hunting gun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The one time it looked like this guy got a real good chance to be a good actor was when he played a tough guy who couldn't let himself be caught by the good looking girls.   They are like the guys in the movies that can't stand each other.  Like the guy at the bowling alley who didn't want to be there at all.  So much of this movie has a good story line.  Well the girls are all real beautiful, but I think the guy is a little too tall and skinny, so it's hard to look good in a bathing suit.  The girl who is supposed to be dead turns out to be alive and well.  She doesn't seem to be that good looking, but the guys are all attractive.  It's funny, but it really doesn't bother me, because it's funny.  A really funny movie about two guys that think they are the only guys that care about women.  I'll be on the lookout for this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "We don't always think like this."   The film that follows our characters through a very bizarre and dark night (a night in a mansion, not in a house, though) is very scary.   This is a very well acted film, but there is a lot of weirdness and weirdness that is brought to you by David Cronenberg (I loved this one).   There are moments that were truly disturbing, but it is mostly a very realistic film.  There is an element of creepiness to this movie that I have not seen since The Cabin in the Woods, but the real problem with this film is that the scares come from the very end.  "Oh, I'm sorry. That's it? Well I'm out of gas now. What do you want from me?"
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Godfather Part III" (1977) is one of the great sequels.   A third time is a charm.  A good old fashioned mafia movie, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966) is the best and most important movie to have inspired the gangster film.  The third "Godfather Part" is probably better than the third " The Ugly, the Good and the Bad" (1958).   This movie is full of classic Italian movie moments.  This is not just a remake of "The Ugly", but an improvement upon it.  There is a good story in "The Don" (Joe Mantegna) and "Don Saluzzo" (Roland Joffe) are the best supporting characters.  "Viva Al Pacino" (1980) is a great sequel to "Vive La Revolucion" (1979).  "Al Pacino in His Own Words", a play about a life gone awry (like so many of my films), is excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Well, I had to see this movie, as it's an excellent piece of entertainment, with its unique look and feel. The characters were all very entertaining to see. The plot had a sense of humour to it, but it also had a lot of drama going on. I was looking forward to see where they went in the movie, and I was not disappointed. The ending of this movie had a very satisfying ending, and if I were to make a comparison, this was a bit like a good episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, but with a lot less humour and a lot more plot to go around. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     First of all I must say that I love this movie a lot and I think you should watch it even if you are not interested in sci fi or aliens. The alien is really beautiful to look at and the film is very well made. The story is excellent and I do recommend this movie to anyone who is into science fiction. I am not really a fan of horror or sci fi movies but this one was a really good one. There are a lot of nice moments in the film which are a nice change from a lot you usually see on TV. The only thing I don't like about this movie is that it is a little long and you must stay awake and do not watch it with the children and elderly because it is very dark in places and you may have trouble sleeping if you watch it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am currently enjoying    "Jungle Book"   with a good laugh.   It is a fun story about the great man known as Jungle Book who lives in a house in the jungle and fights dangerous animals, and that is about it.  The movie looks wonderful as a great family movie, which I did not expect when I saw the trailer.  If you are looking for a fun family movie go and see this movie, but for me it was too short and it does not give a good idea of what the story will be about, but you will have a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      My kids and I had a great time at the film's premiere in New York City, it's not just because of the quality of the film but because of how well all of the members of the cast acted.   When they first start the movie, I knew this was a bad movie from the very beginning.  There was a very strong black and white film at the beginning of the movie with very little color to speak of.  The acting on display is really terrible and not very believable.  They play the movie like a cartoon and I could not get into the film at all.  It doesn't take long before the film starts to get more entertaining as it gets more and more funny.  I didn't expect the film to be that bad but I did expect a bit more from this movie than just a very bad comedy with some funny moments here and there.  At one point, a kid in the audience yells "Look at the eyes!!!"   As soon as this was said, the audience started laughing hard.  When the film became funny, I decided to see it again just for the sake of the laughs but unfortunately, the film continued to get funnier and funnier until the end.    The movie ended with a very funny scene and I'm not sure if it was a good or bad thing.  Some people may think it is bad, but it's a great scene to show what a terrible actor was, John Saxon.  For those that don't know, Saxon is a very popular and popular movie actor and is a huge star in Hollywood.  He was so bad that I was shocked to see how bad he was at acting.  You could see all the bad acting when it was supposed to be a bad comedy.  Now this is the movie I always thought I would like.  This movie had a few good scenes and a few scenes with funny moments.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised to find that a movie like this could be made. This film was good fun. As a result of the fact that they do not take any shortcuts in making a good story they have an engaging plot that made you want to see the story through to the end. This movie was made to entertain and to show that there is hope in the future. I would like to add a few comments to the plot. First of all, the plot is fairly simplistic and the details are few. The first film had a somewhat good plot, and this one has a very good plot. It also makes you feel a certain way and makes you want some good things to happen to everyone and everything. It is also important that you realize that this film was made by people who have seen some of the most successful movies of all time, and they tried to do the best they could and make something good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie with a wonderful storyline.   It is one of the few movies that has a strong anti-smoking message in a positive light and makes it seem real.  It shows that there is a connection between the two major causes of death, heart disease and smoking, and how each can cause an individual to face the death of their loved one.  I felt sad as the camera cut to one of these women who had given up on her children and she was about to meet her fate.  She gave up her life for her children.  The main character, a widower, finds himself caught up in this.  This was a very enjoyable film, and I thought it was worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was the first movie i've seen with the "Funny" tag.   I don't know how good the movie is, but it was funny.  There was a guy who thought a girl was just a doll he'd take home (but then he finds out she is a real woman).   The funny part was the story line.  The guy went to see this movie and was told by the guy in the audience to stop by later.  He got a ticket and came to the movie, and there was a real dead body at the seat next to him.  You see it all right.  Well, what a great ending!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A long time ago, there were a bunch of kids hanging out in a school bus. The bus was going by fast and these kids were bored out of their minds. Suddenly, they heard a voice saying, "There's a giant turtle on the beach!" They ran to the beach to see it, but it was a huge man. He told the kids, "This is the greatest thing ever and you are the lucky people to see this!" But the kids were so bored they didn't believe him. Finally, one of the kids asked the turtle, "Do you really think this is a good thing?" "Oh sure, it's really a great thing," the turtle said. He went on to say, "Now I can teach all the children of the world how to live good lives." He then started running about with a big smile on his face.   There is a small boy who is sitting next to his father, watching the turtle. Suddenly the turtle got up on the sand. He walked over to the kid's father and said, "Hello father! I am so happy to see you!" "Oh, are you happy today," said the boy's father. "Yes, I'm happy," said a surprised voice in the boy. The boy looked up to see a giant smile on the turtle's face. "This was so much fun," said Mr. Turtle. "I was a little worried about how you were going to live your new life." "I'm sure it's going to be fine," said his father. The turtle then smiled even bigger. The man said, in awe, "It's really wonderful!"   This was an excellent movie and I hope to see more.  In the middle of the night I got a call from a reporter. He said that we had two people who had died of drug overdoses that morning. They were found in their beds and the police were on their trail. The next day I called a few of the local hospitals and they all said that none of the people who died were suspected drug addicts.  This is a great movie!   I loved this movie! The kids were all excited about their new turtle. This made them feel important. This movie was so funny!    I loved the turtle and his father who was so sarcastic and witty.  I don't know how a turtle can be so great and at the same time so silly. But this movie does it so well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the title suggests, The Good Lie is a good film about the bad people of the world and the ways in which the bad guys get around. The story, which takes place during the 1960's, is told in a rather slow and methodical manner by a very intelligent and well-spoken narrator (and an old man who knows a lot of history) who is in a position to know a great deal about the lives and actions of the bad actors and people of his own era. I can only give the film a 6 and call it a good story with very little to add, as the action is not much better than a Hollywood thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like "The Avengers". It's a lot like "Thor", except better. The cast are all fantastic in this film. Chris Hemsworth is a terrific action star. He doesn't need a reason to punch a man in the face. He's a really good actor. And Scarlett Johansson is a delight. Her comic book face looks much more real in real life. "The Hulk" was great as well. The character was more like a good-natured cartoon. I could have done without all the yelling and fighting. But then, that was also a part of the movie. There are some fun scenes here, but I feel that "The Incredible Hulk" did not live up to the expectations I had. I'd like to read some "Hulk" stories.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   We're going to assume that most people are probably familiar with the idea of the "pilgrim" by now. The Pilgrims are a group of men and women in search of a better life for their families in the colonies.   The Pilgrim is a group to be sure; but what I found fascinating about this film is that the Pilgrimm did not seem to be all that interested in a "better life".   When it comes to the Pilgrim's, the real question is not where they want to go; it's just how they get there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit that I was somewhat hesitant about seeing this movie. The only movie that I watched in theaters that had an "alley" of sorts was A Dog's Purpose (1939), starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.   (I loved it.)   The movie starts out with a pretty good plot, however a character is really brought down by her actions.  A dog is brought to the shelter by her owner, a homeless man named Jim. He's not too thrilled with her. He says that she's been running away and making up a whole bunch of lies about the situation. He calls her a bitch, tells her that he's never going to change his mind about what he's done to her, and tells her to get off his street.  He takes her to a nearby hospital, where she is given a bit of a beating.  After a bit more beating and lots of cussing, she starts crying, and when she does he tells her it's all because she's a bitch.  The next morning he tells a girl, the owner of the shelter, that he wants to adopt her, that the poor little girl is a good dog, and that he plans to raise her as a dog, to be a good girl. The girl is more than happy to let him do that, and agrees to take him in.  It's pretty clear that she has no real knowledge of what a dog is, or how a dog behaves, or why a dog gets so angry. She's not even sure how a good boy would behave. He does. She does. It's almost like she's trying to show him that dogs are better than bad boys.  But he isn't happy about that, either. When she asks him to go to work he gets so mad. He kicks the door, which he's afraid might be broken, and he tells the girl, in the middle of the night, to come out and get out.   He gets really angry with her when she gets out. She can't go to the office in the morning, and after he tells Jim about this he tells him that the shelter is closed.  What happens next is pretty funny:  There are two stories, which are actually related by Jim. One involves his dog being a bad boy, getting everything he wanted and then blowing up the place when the bad boys tried to steal his money. The other story has a little girl trying to

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For what it's worth - a terrificly executed "spy movie".   The best part of it all, was when the spy-girl, with no idea of what to do, is given instructions by the men to get out of town as soon as she's done with the mission.   It was a really good twist on the usual "spies are needed in dangerous places" genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is pretty good. The director tries to show how the movie was made, i like that he tries to make it realistic. He shows the scenes where all the kids were playing with each other. I like it. But the movie is not good because the movie starts from the children playing.   This movie is good for a little boy. It shows his innocence, how he feels like the boys in this movie. The movie ends with the children laughing because of the fun they had, and the next morning they play with each others toys.  I like this movie it is fun to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Cinderella" is a film in which the heroine never dies. She never comes to the edge of the precipice that lies beyond her reach. She just stays on the side of the mountain.   Her life is happy, she is with the one she loves, she has the most beautiful life.  It is as if this girl does not want to end up like her sister, who drowned. She does not die like the heroine of the story, who died in the lake, when she was young. She has many friends and many things to do.  In the film the whole world seems to be happy and she is not unhappy at all.  She is happy and happy she does not care what happens to her and she can stay on the mountain as long as she wants. She is a character who, in the way of fairy tales, does not go to the end of the earth. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people have praised this movie for being a good sci-fi film. That is understandable, since the production values are top notch. However, if you like to have a good time while watching, you should avoid watching this movie.   The movie starts off a little shaky, with a bad CGI job on a planet. The character designs are ok and the CGI is very well done. But the movie slows down pretty hard. The acting is a little on the bad side, with the actors seeming to be a little out of their depth. It's not a bad acting job by any means, but there is a certain lack of character development and that's where the movie really loses me.  I was really hoping the movie would be more like a storybook about a kid that gets sucked into a wormhole and becomes one of the alien race. I am actually not too disappointed by the movie, and I don't think I will be, but it was good enough to stay away from. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say about a film that manages to be both funny and uplifting at the same time?   We have the titular villain, a man who's sole ambition is to make a pile of money in the casino business. His plan is simple: he has to kill everyone in the room to prove his point, and the whole time his plan is falling apart. When a man in a red wig enters the room, he does so with a weapon which turns out to be an enormous banana. The room is invaded by hundreds of flies, and it is up to the good doctor to save the day by getting the flies off the hotel room and turning them into a delicious fried snack.   The film is full of great sequences such as when we see a man dressed in a black suit trying to get into the hotel, and when a large black cloud crosses the sky and crashes down on the hotel and the black suit looks rather uncomfortable.  Also we see the very human side of the villain, who has never been on TV before and so is always in his room reading a newspaper.  So what does this all add up to? A lot of fun and it has a pretty good ending.   …

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the story is quite interesting, with many subplots and multiple characters. There are several points where I got a bit confused about what was happening and who was who but for the most part it was quite enjoyable. The acting is top notch and the animation was pretty good too. I really like this film, but I would not recommend it to those who are looking for a typical action/comedy. It may have a little bit of comedy thrown in here and there but it isn't really enough to detract from the seriousness of the story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My parents have a new puppy and he is such a nice boy he has the same manners and affection to any dog that i have ever met. He is a sweet and playful puppy but he has a very strong mind and his bite will have you on the floor at times. He had a very difficult time with his foster father who has a good sense of humor as well as the best sense of humour of anyone i have known.   His foster parents had a tough time trying to bring the pup to his old home because of the dog's nature and temper. They tried to make the dog more comfortable by putting him in a crate but he would always escape from the crate and do something out of his character which was to dig his nails into my foot and pull his skin.  The vet at our local vet couldn't make him go and this was the third time the same thing had happened, this time with the pup being more resistant to the vet. He was placed with our foster parents but they couldn't take it and wanted to take him back to his previous owner who had never let him out of the crate. The people that took him out didn't even have a crate or pad or a blanket, so he lay outside in the cold while they slept. He woke them up one night and did his business. They gave him the coldest bath they could find (I was in shock because my feet were so red) and they let him stay there for a day.  He was so tired and it took him the rest of that day to finally settle. I was scared that they had left him outside and then came home. They would not take him and he didn't seem to get better. He finally went back to the owner who was still there and took him home the next day. She never let the pup out.  My brother wanted to adopt him and I think he was a good fit for this family but the whole time i was there he was acting like the bad dog, not wanting to eat or drink and digging his nails in my feet when i walked by. I'm sure the dog was just tired and upset after being outside all day. We ended up giving him up after we watched a video about the bad behavior his previous owners gave him.  I would not recommend this to people that don't have a good breed.   My favorite pup! I love this pup so much. He's super well behaved and super cute! I've had him since
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie a hundred times, and it never disappoints. I wish I could remember a better movie about a little boy who grew up to be a giant, but I never did.   This is about the relationship between a boy and a girl. It's a short film, but there is a lot to like about it. I think the idea of a giant being raised by a little girl is a cool idea, and while the movie is not so good in the way it treats the boy and the girl, it has the potential to be good.  I also like the idea that there are some animals in the world who are larger than others, so that's good. I liked this movie.  The movie itself is about a boy, his sister, and a few others who are trying to get him to eat. It is a short movie, and I think it was better when it was just a single short movie. That was good enough to get me interested in a story about a giant and a little kid. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An entertaining action movie.   It has one of the worst sounding fight scenes ever.  While it looks amazing, the whole movie makes me feel that it's a movie that's trying to be epic (and it's not) but it really doesn't hit that mark.  For a movie like this it doesn't need to be a classic (unless you like a good cheesy action movie).   Just for the record,   the "Boomstick" was in my opinion a better actor than the one playing the "Loudmouth" (or in this case, the "Sniper").   I would give the movie a 4 out of 5 if I could give it a 4.5,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the film at a preview, and even though I was expecting a straight forward action thriller, this was more of an actioner with a few laughs.   The plot of the film was well thought out and interesting.  While I do understand the movie, it doesn't take too long to get going.  The characters all have their own personalities, but it's good to see how everyone comes to a situation.  When they start a firefight, they do so out of a sense of necessity.  There is nothing funny about it.  It's a lot of fun watching the action.  And the final shootout? That was one of the best scenes I've seen in a movie in a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this is just a good film. I mean, this film has the usual clichés of the 'cops and robbers' movie. There is a lot of action in this movie, and that's okay. However, I don't get the whole 'crappy cop' routine the movie takes place in. I can't really understand why he keeps on doing this 'thing' to these victims. I think he should just get a real job so he can earn some money.   The only thing that bothers me is that at times, they really play 'police movie' but the only reason I don`t like the film is that I really hate the ending.  It's really dumb. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to the cinema a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised to see a black and white version of the story from the animated series. Although the animation was not the best, it was certainly better than any cartoon that I had seen in years and it was a nice change of pace for me. The plot was interesting and very much like the animated episode. The only reason I found the story uninteresting is because I did not really care for the lead character who was kind of stupid. I suppose that this was to make a good impression on kids but the animation of the entire movie left a lot to be desired.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is very good, with some well made characters and interesting characters. This was one of the few movies to be a part of my dream-team: The Coen Brothers and Robert Altman!   This is a film that is so good that it does not need to be said.   I think it is important to say a few words about it and to describe a few things about it.  This movie has a very good atmosphere and a great setting in a country in the North of the United States.  In this country there is a strange and scary movie theater called the Munchhausen Asylum.  There, the people who were convicted of killing and eating a person called "Toni" at the theater have been kept there for many years. They are not allowed to have visitors because if they do the people inside will kill them.  Their sole hope in the future is for a stranger named Fred to visit them. Fred is a man who has been sent by a group of psychologists to investigate the MUNCHHUSEN ABUSE.  Fred goes into the movie theater disguised as a movie director. This is to draw people to him. The other people in the theater, however, will not let him in until he makes a special speech which will be broadcast from the stage.  Once he has made the speech and is standing on the stage, he is confronted by the head of the asylum, a woman named Margery.  Margery is not the one who actually killed "Tonna." She is only one of a number of people who have been brought here to see "Tone." She does not want to see him, however.  After a moment of conversation, the two begin to quarrel.  It is obvious that she does not like the idea of Fred being in the movie theatre. She asks him to leave, so that she can take back "Tonic."  She is not in love with "Tron." She would kill him if he were in her room. The movie theater is filled with the sounds of screaming, moaning and groaning. When he is standing outside Margery grabs him by the collar of his shirt and starts to tear him up. Fred, however tries to talk her down, but Margery wants him back in.  Then Margery starts to make strange sounds like a demented woman. Then a door opens and Margery screams. A masked man enters the theater and takes Fred away.  The
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this to be a well-told story.   It starts out quite bleak but becomes quite optimistic as it progresses and there's a real sense of hope in the story. That's probably the reason this film works so well; there's nothing quite as frightening as watching a movie in which a child is forced to do something unthinkable.     But it's not just about a child doing something unthinkable; it's about a family in which the father is an alcoholic and the mother is a homemaker and so there's no doubt about who the true heroes are. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a lot of movies out there that I would say are good but aren't good movies. The only way to tell if a movie is a good one is to watch it a few times and see if you like the characters or not.   I think that The Devil's Rejects is one of the better movies I've seen all year.

Dylan Baker DYLAN BAKER-BARRELL - A DOG who became a man.  It is a movie about a man who was raised in a very tough neighborhood by a tough mother and tough father. He has been an outlaw since he was a kid. But he has changed since he started school. He now has a girlfriend and has learned to be a good husband and father.  This movie will help you remember a happy time when you are just enjoying life and you can do whatever you want to do without being bothered by police.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about a man who was in love with a woman from the age of 8 until the age 21. He was the world's greatest lover. He got married to a woman and moved in with her. The first 10 years of their marriage were great. She raised him to a man and he was able to lead a happy life. She always looked beautiful. He lived a wonderful life with her until the day he discovered that her name was a secret. She had a husband. He left her for another woman. He found out about this at the same time that she discovered it. This was a classic case of what to do about someone that you love who is married. I loved how he was so angry and humiliated. This film had a really funny ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was the first film I've ever seen that was shot entirely on a green screen and it was awesome.        It was also my first ever live action film.  It wasn't a bad movie.  There were moments when I was a bit disappointed in the script.  This wasn't really a bad film, it just didn't do everything that it set out to do.  Some of the characters had a bit too much of a generic nature and the plot felt a bit unimportant in comparison to other similar action movies that I have seen.  I had high hopes for this film and I was excited to see a little bit of the story told onscreen.  The film was fun to watch as it showed us the various roles in a team of soldiers who were to go out and take out the rebel's forces in the city of Hong Kong.  While the action was good it was also good to see the different characters and the way they were brought into the film and what their relationship was.  My only complaint is that a little of the action seemed to be shot in post, there were a few sequences which were a little more slow paced.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie I didn't know what to think. This movie made me really think, and it made me think a lot, and a lot of questions.   It is hard to go into a movie like this without wanting to know the answer to a few questions. Why is a woman with a terrible past able to love a man who's been through a lot? Why is he a nice guy, and can he help her with the questions she has? Why does the man and the woman hate each other? Who is the mother of the boy?   What does it mean when a girl with a bad past says she wants to be a good mother to her boy? What's it like to be born into this world? What is the relationship between a boy and his mother? And the mother is a witch who turns men into girls. This is a great movie. The actors are all good. It was difficult for me to decide what was good and what was bad. Some things are great, some things are bad. I think it would be very difficult to make a movie that is entirely good and completely bad, but this one manages to be both. I like the ending a lot. I was really surprised how well it is written. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't get what the story was about until I was about 20 minutes into the movie.  The story is that an actor plays a young guy who goes up to New York to get married.  A couple of scenes later he gets divorced.  It's like a western that takes place in a Hollywood, but I guess that's not a bad thing.   At the end of the movie the guy's wife comes back and tries to get his attention.  I think the director could have made the movie a lot funnier, but he didn't make it that way.  This was a little hard for me to watch at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are many good horror movies made since the 1930's and there are a lot of good horror films out there. In this one, however, the filmmakers get right to the point and they don't waste time on character development, making you care about these characters.   They're a couple of old folks, but they have the ability to communicate with the young. They aren't scared of kids.  They do have a scare or two, but, thankfully, there's a lot more to this than a bunch of jump scares.  It is scary as hell.  The director is good and has a good eye for detail.

One of the most amazing scenes I have ever seen:  This is a truly amazing scene.  I haven't seen a movie that has been that good since, like, Rocky, The Matrix, Matrix Reloaded.  This scene is a masterpiece.  It is like the perfect combination of sci-fi, horror and comedy.  You'll never look at a movie the same way after watching it.  The music is just amazing.  They really have to do a better job editing this movie out of the Matrix.  And don't even get me started on the awesome ending.

This movie does a good job of being a movie about what it is to live in a great city.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this on opening night (and I watched all the rest) with a small crowd of friends.   The movie started with a long prologue.  We were greeted with a young lady saying "I'm a widow, living alone" and the narrator said that "this is how things work."   And then they took us back to the beginning where we saw the young girl on the couch staring in wonder and sadness.  The girl went on to say that this was "the worst day of her life" and she cried as she saw her boyfriend leave.  Then she got up, hugged her mother, went out into the living room and fell asleep.  There was a boy who told her the story of a girl who lost her parents in a car accident and then found a book in a bookcase. The book said, "There is nothing more beautiful than a woman who cries."  He also said she was so happy when her dog died.  He said she took the book to her mother's house and told her to take the book and to read it for her to die happy.  She took the baby in her arms and then went to her brother and said,   "Why is this boy laughing at me?"  The boys replied, "Because that's the way things go."  It seems the movie follows this story up until it's ending.    The last scene was a woman's funeral where a friend of the girl's mother said to her, "We've seen your mother cry and now, here's your father."  The friend said,  "There will always be people who don't understand you. There will always, always be someone who doesn't see you for what you are."    Her mother looked at her son with a smile on her face and she said,    "Your father was a man of great honor and character. He loved his wife, his family and his country and he gave his life to fight for them.  "     It was hard to watch and I could not stop thinking about the things she said. She said that they had no one else but God and Jesus. The film ended with an old man saying,  "We are going to be together in heaven, all of us, your mother, your brother and all your friends. And I know that when the last notes of our last song play, your friends will join us for a good long sleep." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not for everyone. It is not that easy to get into. This movie has a good story line. It isn't that hard to get a sense of where the story is going.   A good film can have a strong story line and can have some good performances.  In this movie the story line doesn't work. It starts off strong. It gets better and better. The acting isn't as good in this movie as it used to be. They try to keep this story line going. They have some really good moments. The movie is pretty slow but it gets better as it goes along. This was a great movie that you will remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't had a good film in a while, but "The Guest" is a film that gets the job done, at least for a few hours, if only because the character that is the protagonist has no charisma, no drive, and is simply the worst actor I have ever seen. There is very little in the way of characterization or development, and I feel that the "hero" is more concerned about what is going to happen to his daughter than what is happening to himself, and the only reason that is a "good" thing is that it was fun to watch.    The Guest is rated by Screen Rant at a C-   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As an introduction to the story of a girl who lives alone, the film doesn't do a great job of letting you know about the place she's from. The story takes place in a town where people have to get their own place by moving from one flat to the next, and they don't like it when you move in with people who don't want to leave them. It's a very depressing film, one that will make you wish you could stay on the same floor as the girl, because even when the movie isn't making the most of the plot of being abandoned by a boyfriend, it's doing a great deal to raise an intriguing idea about a girl with the right combination of qualities: self-sacrifice, self-reliance, selflessness, a strong desire to be loved, and a love that is only to be found in the most unlikely of places. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the words of the film's poster: "This is a man who would have been the greatest American director in history. He is not only one of the most creative, interesting and original filmmakers ever, he's one of our greatest living storytellers... " " The way a man's life is transformed by an evil act is an inspiring tale. It's the story of an ordinary guy who is taken on by a madman who has no conscience. It makes you ask questions." - John Milius "A masterpiece of modern cinematic craft... a brilliant and compelling, entertaining and original movie." - David L. Wolper, Entertainment Weekly
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's first two acts take the usual formula of a "heroes" journey" movie (or, at least, that's what I was going for). One of the two main characters, Ben, is the son of a former World War I hero, who was killed in the Battle of the Bulge, and the two of them, together with a bunch of others, have to find and destroy an army of Nazis who have taken over the countryside of Europe. This is a formulaic story, in that, on a certain level, I was expecting some kind of "good guy vs. bad guy" conflict. Instead, I found a very well-written, well-paced movie. It's easy to understand (and the film is told in a sort of non-chronological order) but I found I was more interested in the individual characters (as opposed to the world) than I was in the battles themselves.   One character in particular, whose name is never mentioned in the film, has quite a bit to do with Ben's story. He is not a protagonist in the sense that the story revolves around him (or even that he has much to do in the end), but he's a character I can think of who isn't at all obnoxious, and who I find has a definite emotional pull towards Ben. In the end, I think that is a very good thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been enjoying this movie more and more. It is a good example of how a movie can be taken from the page to the screen with a lot of effort put in, and also that it can not only keep the audience on the edge of their seat as it takes us on an adventure but also keep a good level of tension. I love the movie and it is a great reminder of what a great adventure movie can do, especially the scenes in the desert.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It has a nice atmosphere, but I think it needs a little work with the script. The movie is too much about its setting and its characters, the director does a good job with it, but his choices can not stand alone. It's hard to get to know all the characters because the movie seems to spend too much time with them. It can be too easy to feel like you know these characters from somewhere. I guess this is why I really loved this movie because it was like being able to know someone you only met for a short time but know a lot about them. I think the director needs to add more to the story or change it up a bit.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting and very well-crafted story about a man who has lost his wife and a young girl to an unknown assailant.

I think it is a very well made and very interesting film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a film that I highly recommend. In fact, I am very sure that a lot of people will really like this film. This film has an intelligent plot, well done performances and, yes, even some really wonderful special effects. There are a lot more of the usual sci-fi tropes used in these type of movies. However, I was pleasantly surprised that this was not just another film about a robot sent to save Earth. I liked that this film was a bit different from the usual science fiction films that we have come to expect. I found that there were a lot less of the sci- fi tropes and a lot, much more thought and care was put into this film than most of them. This is a very good movie, so please, if you haven't seen this one yet, go watch it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie with my girlfriend last night and we were both quite blown away by it. We had just finished the movie and it is still a good film, with some good dialogue and it did well at keeping it's mystery/suspense theme going for the majority of the movie, but towards the end, as it did to us, it started to go into a more predictable style of action film, as the movie ran its course. I thought the movie was done really well, though I must admit that it has a slightly dated feel to it. I think the movie is great to watch for the story and the acting and it really is a good action film.

They had a lot of fun doing all this. But after that, you really didn't know who did what. It wasn't hard to follow along with the story. The actors were great. It has a bit of a cheesy feel about it but it still worked. This was definitely a good family friendly movie to watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this film quite a bit.   First of all, it's the first time I've seen a film based on a novel.  It's good.  In the beginning of the film, we find out that the main character, Bill Wannabeski, is a "human dynamo" (read as a character who does his own thing) who has worked all of his life to be as comfortable and successful as possible in his chosen profession.  However, he has recently come out of a long illness and is now able to resume his old habits of playing the accordion.  Unfortunately, he finds out that his partner, Dr. St. Clair St. Claire, also suffers from some sort of illness and can only take care of herself.  Then, a "brave, mysterious stranger" arrives and introduces himself as "The Stranger."  He explains that he has a "dream" that he wants to tell the world about.  But the problem is that he doesn't want people to know about the "dream."  The "dream," of course, is actually a dream-within-a-dream where a man in a clown outfit, a woman in a black dress, and a baby (it's a "baby," by the way) are trapped.  Eventually, the group manages to escape and get to Dr. Claire's home, where they find that he's had a "trouble" in his life lately.  While the main characters are talking, a very unusual sound is heard, and then something begins to change...       In order to make this movie more enjoyable, they have to throw a few jokes in at the end.  This isn't a joke per se, but a little joke.  We know that the woman in black is "Polly."  This is a character that Bill had played in a previous movie (a movie which, unfortunately, had a different title... it was called, "Caught in the Act" in the original release.  )   What is interesting, though, is that, in the previous movie, she is a man.  The woman is also described as "the man."  At this point, Bill doesn't care much about his job... or any of his current relationships.  As a result, he decides that he'd rather go for a short time, just to have a chance to talk to the "stranger"
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (   ) I just watched the first half of this, and it's wonderful. It starts out slow with a nice little mystery and a good bit of comedy and then a pretty cool thriller, with very little to dislike. I'm glad the actors were really nice too!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit, I did not love this movie. I think the script is okay, and I like how the director and actors are portrayed. The story takes a while to get going, and it's a bit slow going. The acting, however, is really good. There is a guy named George Wagg, played by George Burns, who is very quiet and nice. He doesn't have much in the way of personality, but the movie is good. This is the first of two movies that I have seen where the director was not well respected by the people who worked with him. This film is not as good as "My Mother, the Car" or "The Man in the High Castle" but it's not bad either.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen a few movies with similar themes and themes of love, loss, and love of nature. It was refreshing to see this kind of film with more originality than your average movie. The cast was great. I thought it was a good idea for a movie about a couple. They were not the typical romantic couple like we have seen in all movies about this. The movie did make me feel a bit sad and confused about some of my past relationships. The only thing that was predictable was the ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The cast is great.   They have good chemistry and their characters are developed nicely.  This movie has great effects.           The story is very good.  They start with a bad guy who wants to kill the main character so he can keep his treasure.  He has a few problems.  But then he meets a woman and they get together.    She is very beautiful.   They become a couple and the bad guy tries to kill her.  Unfortunately they make love and he is a real bad guy.  The bad guy wants to steal the treasure of the treasure woman.  You have to watch this movie!  It was the beginning of the movie and we are now in the second part.  We are seeing the bad guys again and we get to see how he came to be a bad man.  In the meantime the bad man has made a lot of money and he has two sons.  One of the sons is a very bad boy.  I watched this movie on the plane from Newark to San Diego.  So I have seen the movie in a hotel and the room is very nice.  At one point you have a couple who have just left the house and are sitting on a bench.  Then the woman gives the guy some money and the guy starts to run and get away.  When he is running to the city he runs into a very nice looking woman.   She invites him into her house and they start to make love.  It was so wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    We all loved this movie and can see this movie as good as the good of the films of the 70s, 80s and 90s! It was a film you watched without any worries about the length of the movie and with your heart in your throat you can not stop watching the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The one thing you need to know about the movie is that, when they say "brought to you by" and then "a movie about", it's really not that bad.   This movie is like the old 70s cop show movies where a cop would try to catch a crime he couldn't because he couldn' t hear it, so he'd do it like the cop shows you did in those old TV's from the 70s.  I guess I was hoping for more of a story about what goes on in this movie, but, it was a good little thriller, with a good lead actor (in the wrong place at the wrong time), and a good supporting actor, with his "gadgets".   And to be fair, there were some moments where it seemed a bit rushed (I'm talking like the ending of a movie with a lot of commercials on).   There are a couple of parts in this that are kind of cheesy, but it's not that big of a deal, you can ignore it if you want to, but other than that it is a very fun movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie a couple times now, and it's pretty decent. The whole thing is pretty stupid, but there's a funny moment here and there. It doesn't really stand out much on it's own. The acting is pretty terrible, but not that bad. You could look at this movie as a satire on the whole stupid TV show business. But the movie does have its moments, and a few of the jokes aren't all that bad to be honest. If you're looking for a stupid movie with an original story, you won't find a better one here.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is my favorite movie. This was my first viewing of the movie and I enjoyed it a lot. It had a great cast of characters and a good story line. The cast of the film was well balanced with a good balance of humor, action, drama, romance, mystery and more. The film wasn't a huge hit but if you like a good mystery with a love story, a good action flick that has a good ending, action that's real, lots of action, and lots of comedy then I recommend this movie to you. This is a great movie to watch with a group of friends and I recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pretty bad. And it's a pretty good movie to boot.   The first act is great.  A man is shot, but miraculously, he's back a few days later.  He meets another man and they fall in love. But in order to get him back, they must kill a beautiful young woman who is in love with him.  The only thing that makes this movie even worse is the dialogue, which is mostly incomprehensible and stupid.  I just couldn't figure out how they were going to get the young woman to kill herself and the other man.  Why was the guy wearing a trenchcoat and what was he supposed to do if she didn't go along with this plan?  This is the best one I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought I was going to be in trouble for having this film on so I could be at home and watch it with my son.   It was a good showing and I loved every minute of it.  This is an amazing story about a man who is obsessed with a woman,  but he can't see her, but she knows he is after her.  I would highly recommend this film if you love a story about love and romance, mystery and suspense, and if you are a fan of thrillers and mystery stories, I think you will love this film too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm an American living in a foreign country. I'm a student and not much of a film buff. But, when I watched the film, I found myself enthralled and excited. I love all types of westerns. They are unique, well acted, well written, well directed, well performed, and I have enjoyed them all. I loved this one a lot.   It was a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found myself really impressed with the movie.   The movie does a lot to really help make the concept of 'human zoos' seem plausible, and the movie is definitely worth the time to watch.  In the movie, a small group of people who have been abducted by a UFO, have to do a number of trials to figure out what they have been involved in (i.e. the alien's spaceship), to find out if there are any other humans alive out there.  Although the movie doesn't start out that great, by the end of it it is pretty exciting and the plot is intriguing.  The acting in the movie from the human performers is pretty good.  There are a few good sci-fi movies out there, so this one might not be the best, but it is definitely a must see movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little different than your average family movie, because it does not have a lot of family jokes.   The first hour is about a big battle of wits between the parents who want to take over the world and the kids who are all fighting each other.  The final battle is the father and son battle of who will take over.  I think there is an even bigger battle in the middle, because the father is very clever and knows how to use everyone's weaknesses against him.  There is a lot more going on in the end than in the beginning.

I had no idea what to expect when I watched this, because this movie is not for the faint of heart.  After watching the first five minutes, I was in hysterics.  There is a very creepy feeling to the film, but that's what makes it so cool.  If you're thinking about watching this, you should be prepared for a great time.  "The Day The Earth Stained".   This is an awesome movie!  I didn't realize that the movie was filmed in Canada.  This movie is an action/sci-fi hybrid.  The sci-fic in this movie definitely takes the cake.  It's amazing how many cool ideas are thrown around in this film.  I also love how the whole story is told through a couple of different perspectives. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first attempt at reading a book in a theatre:  I had come across some reviews online about 'Buffy' but never finished the book.  I remember the moment of disappointment well.  I was intrigued, a bit bored, and somewhat irritated with a plot that was fairly predictable and predictable.  At the end, I realised that I was never really in the mood to sit and read a novel.   This is a film about friendship: the bond between Buffy, a teenaged girl from a middle-class family, and Willow, a shy student who's an admirer of Buffy's.  As the film progresses, the bond grows and they form a close friendship.  Buffy's family live in a posh suburban home and Willow and her mother struggle to cope with Willow's newfound independence and confidence.  What I liked about 'Dawn of the Dead' was the way that it captured the energy of the horror genre.  It is a horror film in the traditional sense, but the effects are very effective and the story is quite a nice one.  'Dawntide of the dead' is a very enjoyable film and one that I hope to see again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Starring: Jack Nicholson, Jeff Goldblum, Kate Capshaw, Ed Begley, Jr., Peter Boyle, Richard Lewis, Daphne Zuniga."   Director: George Roy Hill (1944)   This movie stars: Jeff Gold Blum, Ed Beahley Jr, Kate, Peter Boyle and Richard Lewis.   Well this film is very unique as it is a film about a little boy who is called "The Great Pumpkin" by the children in a rural town because he has come out with a giant pumpkin.  The town folk have a hard time accepting this and eventually a big fight breaks out between the town folk and the children who think the Pumpkin is really a man.  A real life story if I did say so myself.  This is a fun little film.  "I would like to thank George Roy Hall (1948- ) for the inspiration for this film."  "My mother's pumpkin, but a giant"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, I was so happy that I went to see this movie. I have seen all the original 'Gremlins' movies, so I knew what to expect. I had seen a clip from this movie online and I was ready to see it. I was glad I went!   I have never seen this movie before so this is the first time I see it, so we will see how well it did. I liked it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen several other reviews about this movie, but this one is by far the best I have ever seen!   If there was one bad thing about this one it is that the ending was very rushed... but, hey, who's gonna complain about a happy ending?   This movie is definitely one of the funniest I have watched, especially the ending, and it is definitely a lot of fun to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't really remember the movie that much but I will never forget it. I saw it again about 30 years ago and it was a great movie.    When I saw the film again I saw a change in the look of the characters. The movie was a bit more serious and dark. The characters looked more mature and the story was not quite as funny as the first time I saw this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most brilliant, exciting, and beautifully designed film I've seen in a long time.   As mentioned in the review above, it has an almost cinematic look to it, with a visual style that looks like a mix of both old-fashioned and modern.  The movie opens with an extended shot of an empty room with a window in the background.  A man is walking around with a big suitcase on his back.  As the man approaches a dark wooden door (like a small door), the suitcase swings open, revealing a beautiful girl.  She's wearing a blue dress, and she's holding a flower in her hand.  It's obvious from the beginning that this girl is special.  Her looks are like a perfect mixture of her appearance in the opening sequence, as well as from her character in the film.  (Also, she makes a great narrator. )  There are many similarities between the girl in the house and Mary Poppins, as she also has the same "good looks".  She goes to school, too, and makes friends with a boy at the school.  While this boy, named Paul, is not as smart as the girl, he is clever enough to take advantage of the girl's weakness.  Eventually, the girl falls in love with Paul and they marry.  One day, Paul disappears, and the girl is left to fend for herself.  But at least she is surrounded by friends, whom she keeps.  The ending is the most beautiful I've ever seen.  After the movie has finished, I walked out into the streets of Manhattan and took in the view.  If you like a movie like this, it's not hard to see why it's been making waves in the recent years.  I know it has a long title, but I think you'll agree after watching it.  - Michael J. Anderson
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You have to be there, I can't stress how huge the movie was, you were there, or you know it was there. I was in shock for weeks. I have been a huge fan of the show for years and I can say without a doubt that it exceeded every expectation I had. I loved the characters. My only issue was with the end, but it was so worth it. I would love to see this on tv and I want to see the next season of the series. The finale was amazing, and it was good to see a different show than the "Hip Hop Family Reunion" on TV.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love watching a movie. The only reason this was so hard for me to review is because I am still recovering from my second bout of the flu. This is the fourth movie I have seen in a row that has made me want to vomit. This movie is so, so bad. If you have not seen this movie yet, there are no words to describe how horrible it is. If a man raped and murdered a mother and her little boy, and if his sister got her leg cut off, and she was then raped by the man for a second time, why the hell would anyone want to watch that movie?   The plot is a mess. It is a man rapes a little girl, who then gets killed and her mother goes after the man. There is absolutely no reason to make a movie with such poor writing in my opinion.   A man who is in prison (in the movie) tells the girl to tell the murderer he is sorry about what happened, and he said he was sorry for having to kill her, and then the murderer, who is a woman, tells her to do it.  The murderer is not given any reason to be in prison and she is never shown being in fear for her life.  I am not going to sit here and tell you how bad this movie is, because I do not think anyone else can come up with something that is worse than this. I was just watching it today and thought to myself, "It is just a little kid that is raped, killed and then her mother tells him to do something horrible."   You cannot make me laugh at something like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Man With One Red Shoe" is one of the few films I've seen that really makes an impact in terms of emotion.   It's a very personal story about an ex-marine whose family was killed in the Vietnam War and how he copes with the loss and continues his path to become a private detective.  This is a film that I've been looking for for years and I think that it will be my favorite of the year.  I'm just so glad that it's finally coming to DVD in this collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most recent installment of the franchise is a remake of the 1976 cult film,  The Fly.   This time around the story is somewhat different and much funnier than its predecessor. The flying insects are no longer the focus but the new characters are fun.   I always loved the original The Fly with Gene Wilder as the lead.  I have watched it many times and am always entertained.  But when I read the script for this remake I found that it has a whole new twist on the story.  "No, I'm not crazy."   Now, when I first heard of the movie adaptation I didn't like it at all.  I thought it was a ripoff of The Fly.  At first I figured that it was just the same story as the original except with less science and a whole lot of comedy.  However, I think that it could have been better.  The original The fly was written by the great Stan Winston.  He was a writer for the "Duck Dynasty" series as well as the popular sitcom "The Drew Carey Show"  So I figured the movie would be written by a guy who knew how to write a great script.  Unfortunately, there are many parts that don't work.  For one, they don't explain what has changed.  And there are also a lot of jokes that just fall flat.  Now to be fair the plot has a lot going for it.  There are three main characters and two new ones.  Their plot is really intriguing and the plot is never boring.  In the end the film is more about the comedy and not the science.  This movie is certainly worth watching.  Even if you don't like sci-fi or comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would definitely go to see it again.   It wasn't the funniest film I have seen or a good horror film either, but it was just good.  If you enjoy some horror films, it was fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There was a lot more to this movie than you can see on a first run.   This movie is a mix of the best of the original and new.  For a while this movie was out of print in bookstores and used to be available at the local independent bookstores.  They were out of stock for a while.  I bought it from a bookseller a few years back.  This is not an easy movie to find and when it came back on the shelf, I had to buy it.  It was the first film I saw in 35 years that gave me a flashback.  We get to see a different side of Jim Carrey and his comedy antics.  Carrey was the only star in this movie and that's really saying a lot.  There are not many films where you feel a part of it. This is a film of pure fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is the story about an alien, the Mule.   What makes the movie really awesome is that the Mules have the ability to communicate with animals through a special helmet.  This means that they can talk to cows, pigs, cats, dogs and horses.  And that is just the beginning.  The Mule then has the ability also to talk to the other animals of the earth.  Mules also have the power to fly by using a special wing-like device, they can also fly in their own special ships.  All of this is amazing!  What is even more amazing is that there are Mules all over the world, all trying to help mankind.  Unfortunately one of the Mullets gets killed and then the film starts to take a dark turn.  When we finally see the human side of things we are in some trouble, the human race is in decline and we only see a small group of humans.  But what can the humans do? They start to turn to the Mulsers for help, but when the Mulu's are not there they are now being blamed and all sorts of evil is done to the people of earth.     If you liked the first part, you will enjoy the movie even more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm always interested in seeing how people deal with adversity.   In this case, the actor who played the role of Dr. Larkin is played by Joely Richardson, whose screen credit is listed as Joely R. Richardson.  The role of the doctor was given to Robert Duvall, who was the lead in a little movie called "The Devil's Advocate."   The film featured a young Dr. John Larkin and Dr. Andrew M. Ranser as they were on the run from the law.  Dr. Renscher is played very well.  While Dr. Richardson is a good actor, I found Ranster to be a tad bit off.  What can I say?   As a person who is still young and naive and unaware of the world around him, I was shocked when Ransmer got arrested for his involvement with the occult.  I think Dr. M. Lagan (Richardson) would be a good choice to play a part of the film.  He has some experience with the supernatural and would make a good Dr. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best movie about how the war in Iraq turned out so far.   First off, this movie is not about the invasion of Iraq.  It is not a movie about why the US invaded.  There is a little bit of that, but it is really about the aftermath of the invasion.  This movie does not take place in Baghdad or Basra, it takes place in Basra.  The movie opens with a truck that just plows into a group of US Marines standing around drinking beer.  These Marines look so dumb as to be really bad guys.  Then the movie moves to the scenes of soldiers fighting an Iraqi army, fighting in Iraq.   This movie is really good at depicting that fighting.  Even though there is not much happening during the movie, the movie is still good enough.   I was a little worried about the ending of this movie.  First, it is a lot more action oriented, more than the last film.  Second, the ending takes a little longer than the previous film, but when it does get there it is pretty good.   When I watched this movie, I thought about it a lot.  When I saw the end credits, I was pretty sure that I would like to watch the movie again.  I think this movie will end up as a good sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of people, I didn't know much about the original The Last Starfighter, and as I watched it the more I watched the less I liked it. What I liked about it was the fact that it didn't really try to push forward a story or a story telling concept. The main character, Jake, is a pretty good guy who gets a bad situation and ends up finding his new ship, which turns out to be a big old dung-heap. In fact, the whole episode is pretty much a collection of dung. It has some very good special effects and a very good soundtrack, but it doesn't really do much else, which is just about okay. It's a lot like a bad low-budget movie made with a bunch of friends. The Last Jedi, in contrast, is the best thing I've seen in a long time. I mean, I really really really loved this movie. It was a little bit like Star Trek: Into Darkness with a bit less of a Star Trek theme and a whole lot more Star Wars.   I liked the way they treated the prequels, the original trilogy as a whole, but The Last Man on Earth was so incredibly fun. The way the film was shot was just fun to watch. In terms of writing, it was very good. The dialogue was very witty and amusing. The directorial style is very well done. All of the actors are wonderful and their performances are great. The performances of the guest stars are really quite outstanding as well. I don't think the story is as good as The Last Stand, but I'm just saying that because this is an original story that was made by a bunch different people who don't necessarily have a very great track record when it comes to making original movies. I didn�t really like the original Star Wars movies, so it was nice to see a story that didn't go the same way.  I don�t know what it is about this movie, but every time I watch it I'm like, �Yeah, that�s just like The Last Run,� which is not at all a bad thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I went to see this movie with the kids last night after a long day of work. It is great to watch a movie with kids, even the youngest ones. It was great to see the kids do something they enjoy doing.   I'm sure they will be getting a lot of movie time in their lives and this movie will serve to make their memories a little longer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. It is not a story about how an alcoholic kills a woman but a film about alcoholism and its consequences.   This movie is about how two very different men, one the ex-convict and the other an alcoholic, end up killing each other after a brief affair. Both men go through the same emotional ups and downs but the differences are more than just the characters' actions.  First off, you get the feeling that the story is about a man with a heart of gold. He is a good person but his heart isn't. I feel that the real story is one of a good man being punished for what he has done and what he will do in the future. It's not about drinking but a man who cannot accept the fact that he is an alcoholic and who cannot let go of his addiction. The way he thinks is how a drug addict thinks. I felt that this is the most realistic story I've ever seen on film and it is the film's strength.  Second, the acting is good.  I've seen some good acting but this was really good. The leading man and the woman were believable.  In all, I like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best science fiction movie to ever be released. From the opening shot the movie is a masterpiece and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that it's the best science-fiction movie I've ever seen in my life.   "The world is a very small place," a voiceover says. "That's why we go."   And in the world of the movie, Earth, a world of people of different ages, different professions, different beliefs and beliefs that are not very different at all. It's a world that has been in existence for billions of years and yet it's never been touched by the light of day. That's the reality of it.  In the movie the human race has been on Earth for a very long time. The first people that ever lived, who ever lived on Earth and died on Earth. There were a lot of different cultures. It all ended in a massive explosion in a place called Chernobyl. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, as you can see, I'm not a very big fan of movies, let's say I'm an average fan. I'm usually not a fan of action movies, though I like the Expendables. Anyway, when I saw this movie, I was like "I wish I were in it." I was also impressed by this movie. I was just like "this is so funny, and so different!" My wife thought it was just a regular horror movie. My son, however, was all like "oh no" and "this movie is gross!" As you probably have noticed, this review is a bit of a rant. I wish it were more like a rant! However, I have to say, I will be watching this movie again. This is a fun movie that I like. I will see it again!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was at the cinema with my wife (we are huge fans of the series) and she and I both loved the movie. I think it was well done and it is very funny. It was the first time I heard of the name of this actor and when I heard the title of the movie I was a little surprised. I was expecting something like "Citizen Kane". The film was well made with the usual British style and that is a good thing. The movie itself is not bad at all. It has good acting from a few British people that do their best. The plot is simple and yet complex. It also did not use a lot of CGI. There is a lot more sex in this film than in "Cuckoo's Nest". As a whole it is a comedy with a lot about how we love, what we love and how our love will never last.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "All About Eve" is a classic.   The scene at the top of the movie where George is reading to Eve and she's laughing like a baby is a beautiful moment.  The movie is so well made.  It's a slow-motion nightmare in which there's no good and no bad.  As the movie goes on, George is trying to make the situation better, but he's trapped in a nightmare.  He sees a movie that reminds him of him being a baby.  I remember a scene in the movie I saw when I was a kid where George comes in a house and finds a toy dog, and I remember thinking that the dog looked like me.  So when I think of a man in a movie screaming and cursing, it's the image of me. I have a very short memory, but it was still there when I saw this movie.  This movie had a very interesting story line.  There were some interesting, but not very original, ideas about incest.  But it was all in a good way.  If you like a good, long movie, I would recommend you check this out.  - July 16, 2006What a movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot, as told by its creators is that the earth is about to be destroyed by a comet. The only hope that mankind has in this event is a man by the name of James Kirk. In a last ditch effort, Kirk travels back to Earth and convinces a group of people that a comet will not hurt Earth, but instead would be a great benefit for mankind. He shows them a video and explains the history and technology of a man named Abraham Lincoln, that saved the planet from destruction by saving a boy from a burning building with his own bare hands. However, a small boy named Abraham, who would later become a future president of the United States, is the one who saved Abraham's life.   Abraham is a young boy and he is a genius, because he knows how to make small items to save a building with very little materials.  He was also able to save Abraham's father from being burned alive by the fire.  The whole plot was told with a great sense of humor and was very easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie.   I like the humor, and the story line.  The only thing I thought I could of used more of was the villain (it is a good villain), and I felt he was a little over the top, but he made his point, and there wasn't any way to make a good point without making a bad guy.  Overall, a great movie that I wish more people would see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an excellent movie!   I think the script is really good.   The acting is excellent as is the writing.  There is a love-hate relationship going on between the two characters.    It seems to be a love story with a lot of heart.  It has everything in it.  As a matter of fact, it is a comedy.  The plot is very interesting and the characters are very realistic.     I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story and good acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like this movie. It is just like a good old-fashioned western.   There are lots of characters in this movie that I really don't know, but I think it will be really interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not a movie where the story is very interesting and deep or it is a beautiful story with a lot of drama and very strong acting performances by all the cast. This is a movie which is a simple love story with no big twists and plot twists. The story is pretty simple to understand but it is quite good.   The movie is a little bit dated but that shouldn't prevent you from watching this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie's not great by any means (the acting is bad and the plot is a train wreck) but the movie is entertaining.  It is interesting that the director didn't want the movie to be about the girl and it is more about her friends.   I think the story could have been better, but the ending makes up for it.  And in the end, it was a lot more entertaining than I expected. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (6/10)   The film is based on a book, but there is little to no storyline; a "movie". In the book, there is a scene where a man is trying to shoot his wife; he is going to his wife's apartment, and she is not there. As he is preparing to kill her, he sees her naked, as she is on the couch. He sees her in the shower, and they have sex. Then he sees a man on the street, holding a gun. He goes to the man, tells him to go away, but the man shoots at him. The next morning, the man is in the hospital with a broken leg. I didn't like this movie; there is no plot; it just had a little bit of a story; which was boring to me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I may be in love with this movie! It has a very unique setting and there is a unique kind of atmosphere here. The cinematography is excellent. The music, the cinematography and the characters were very well done and I enjoyed every scene. The way they used the slow scenes was very interesting. There were a few things that I didn't like, but I think they do a better job than I thought they would. If you like movies with a little bit of a twist to them this may be for you! If you don't like this type of movie then you may as well look elsewhere.

This movie has not many moments of bad writing or bad acting. The best scenes of this movie are the action scenes. The other scenes are quite good. It is not hard to understand the story of this "Indiana" Jones film. The characters are good. The story is very exciting and the movies are not only fun but they are very impressive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good thriller. The movie takes place in a small small town in the middle of America. The plot is simple: A man and a woman visit a house, a house that is abandoned. After walking in, they find out that there are people inside. The two women enter the house and the man follows. Eventually he finds out that the house belongs to a woman who is missing. The woman, Annie, is found dead in the bedroom. The murderer is a man who is living in the house, but is not afraid to show himself. The killer tries to seduce the women. After a while he goes missing. One by one they go to the police. The police tells them about the murderer, and they go in search of him. They meet some characters who help them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the fact that this movie has a little of everything. The movie itself was quite good. I was amazed at how detailed the movie was in detail of the building and the movie looked like an old movie, not like a new one.   The movie was a little bit slow for me because of the slow build of the movie. The story itself was very good, and there was a very good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited to see this one and for the first half it really was. The film was mostly entertaining, but didn't really do much with the gimmick of having the entire city running out of food and then everyone turns into rats. The story was a bit weird with a lot of random characters from different walks of life coming together to get what they need. It was a fun movie to watch, but it seemed to be somewhat forced to me, so I didn't find much enjoyment out of it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen all of the Saw films and this one is by far the best. I enjoyed the fact that this film was about two children who just wanted to run away from the house when their father was killed. I really enjoyed the ending of this film because I thought that the whole house was going to go up. I liked the fact when the girls left, they had a nice dress. I thought this was an excellent movie and should be in your collection.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved The Mummy (1999) in a very good way, and even though I did not like The Mummies as a whole, the acting was amazing and the special effects were excellent.   But this movie has a few weaknesses: 1. The characters are all the same. 2. I found that it took forever for the ending to actually hit home, and that was after I watched the opening act (and I watched it very quickly to get to the film) 3. There was not really a good reason for why the Mummy needed to use a human to do his bidding. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a solid movie that does not waste a moment in showing us something fun that makes you want to laugh or to cry or to get angry.   While the movie tries to keep you interested, it does so by not making you too interested. The movie has a lot of things going on that are fun.  At one point I was trying to figure out what was going on. At other times it was just fun to watch. The acting was good as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I was about 10 minutes into this movie when I heard a woman scream "My God, I'm going to kill you!"  In the next scene a woman is hanging from a tree and a man tries to save her. When the man falls to his death she grabs a tree branch and cuts it off, then stabs him with the sharp branch to end his life.  I don't think I've ever seen such a horrible, horrible, movie.  The movie takes a lot of time to give us the backstory of the evil mastermind behind this whole thing and what makes me so frustrated with the movie is the fact that it takes that long to set this up. It's like the evil guy had to work really hard to find a girl who was just like the one he saw in the bar. Then they got the girl. She's nice, nice girl with nice personality and she tells them where to find her brother who is in danger. When she finds him, she tells the girls that they can't go to his house because he has a wife who is afraid that his evil son will come over and kill her. She doesn't want to go, but the others are convinced that they will have to go to get the book that is said to kill the boy. So the others decide that they are going to wait outside for the evil boy to come. The evil son of the husband is standing by a tree with a gun on it. He's ready to come over for dinner and the girls go outside to wait for him. So all the guys are standing outside waiting, waiting for him to come and kill them, when suddenly a little girl comes out of the house. She says, "Daddy is coming. Daddy is coming." And a little boy, the son of that evil brother, comes out to meet her. And the mother, I believe her name is Lola, comes running out to protect her little boy. At the end of the movie, when she sees the little girl being killed, she screams "Oh, my God, he's killing a little baby!"   She does have an odd way of speaking, but I like her anyway.   The best part of this movie was the ending. The two evil people are lying on the ground, dead. The little girl walks up to them and says "Daddy, daddy, I love you." The mother is sobbing and the daughter looks up at her and says, (or rather says
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm so happy I made the commitment to watch this movie when I heard it was coming out (I can't even remember the last time I got a movie on demand). The way the characters react to each other and the way the story is told...it's just so much better than a lot of other movies. It's a really great mix of comedy and suspense and it was funny as hell the whole way through.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's really really good!   The film is about a bunch of friends who are going to a concert with their moms and when they leave, they don't get what they expect.   I really think this is a film to watch with a nice big group of friends for the day.  I would love to watch it with a big group as well.  I have watched a lot of funny movies.  This one is funny and a lot different than the other funny movies I have seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie like this one will get you in a good mood, even if you have never read the books before. It's a short story but the story is quite good and you will like it. You have the two characters from the book, which you like well, but then you get a bit to know who is the bad guy. I can say it is not my favourite of the books but it was a good story to read. I would recommend this movie to you to watch it to know more about the book.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "I've been looking forward to the return of a favourite franchise since I saw it for the first time. The new film is a great follow-up to the first film. The movie starts with a classic line that will have you remembering it. I think the character of a mysterious man called Professor Simeon, played by Liam Neeson, fits in with the other characters perfectly. The actor is brilliant and this movie is filled with great acting. There's an awful lot of action in this film but it's very well choreographed and shot. There are a few parts that are a bit boring but that's no bad thing. It's just that the movie is too big to be satisfying for just the action. The main character's quest is very well written and the movie keeps the pace very well and the story develops in a good way. It also has some clever dialogue."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an ex-Marine and I'm an old dog at heart, so I'm usually a bit cynical when it comes to movies about military life.   But I watched this movie, and it did not let me down.  At a time when we have so few good movies about the Marines in general (i.e. Saving Private Ryan and The Hurt Locker ), this is a great movie.  The characters are well developed, and the plot is good.  Not every Marine is going to die in this movie. I liked the humor and the way the movie was shot, it was very nice.  And the ending was brilliant.  I wish the movie had been made a few years ago when the war was over.  Now that the war is over, they should make a sequel! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the closest I've come to a religious experience and I have had a few but this was the closest to having a religious event I've ever had. From the moment the movie opens you are thrown into the world of the movie and its story. You know this movie is going to be some religious or mystical stuff and it is very well done.       The movie follows a priest named Brother Kevin, he is a young man that has been brought up as a Catholic by his mother. He is now at the age of 28 years old and his life has been full of problems. He has a woman he loves in the church and is in love with her. Her name is Mary. She comes from a poor family and in his own words the family are a bunch of sinners. There is no doubt about this, all the characters are flawed in some way and the movie is a good description of the evil in this world. I'm sure most of the characters in this movie have no idea what they are doing or how to go about it.  The story is told from Kevin's point of view and his story is about his spiritual journey and his search for God. Kevin has a dream in which he is in a world of black clouds and fire and demons. He wakes up to find himself in the woods and the only thing he has is his knife. He comes across a group of people and is taken to a cave. He sees a woman and a man who are in the presence of a man called God. He talks to him and he asks if he has ever felt anything like this. He tells him the story of his life in his home town, his father being killed, his mother leaving him, his brother leaving him and the whole family being torn apart. He believes that he is on a mission to find a place called Heaven and if he does, it will be the place of Jesus Christ. Kevin starts wandering around a town called New Jerusalem and meets a woman called Mary who also has visions of God. She is the daughter of a priest and is searching for a man named Joseph who she believes is the one who found her father. All of this is very interesting to watch as Kevin tries to find his way to God and find his place in the world. He does find some information about what God wants from the world but is unable to find the information himself. There are some interesting things about Kevin that make him a sympathetic character. He seems to
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has everything that an action movie should have: it's funny, it's action, and it's a great adventure. It's all of those things and more. I really liked that it didn't just focus on the two brothers, but also a young girl who is the reason why they are trying to rescue the others. I thought it was also great how they were both playing by different rules and it was great to see them do things that weren't usual for them, but they did anyway. The movie also had a great ending.   I highly recommend this movie to action movie fans who want a little something different from the normal movies that are out there, and I think that it will also be an action hit with people who haven't seen many movies before.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen many movies made by the people who make them: Hollywood, the US, Europe, Korea.   They all have their pros and cons and the Korean version had its pros and the cons.  Like a lot of movies, it had a lot to say.  The first scene was a bit cliche: a man wakes up in a cell.  He says he has woken up in the wrong cell. A little later he asks if it is the cell from the first one.  Then the other prisoners come in.  This is about all that is in a few minutes.  I don't like prison movies.  It is a place where people don't know what is right and wrong and the other people are mean.  You are forced to do what the others ask.  There was only one prisoner and one guard.  My wife went to see it with me and we saw it together and I thought about this scene and I remembered that when we went to the hospital with my father.  They were so rude and the hospital people had to come into the room and check all the beds to see if they were empty.  But the funny thing was that the hospital man would never say his name.  And the other guys in the prison had an accent and the nurses had funny voices.  When I think about it, I think the best way to describe prison is a hospital where everybody wants to be treated like a madman.  All the nurses are mean and all the prisoners are mean to everybody.  We saw how the inmates were punished for their mistakes.  Of course there were prisoners who did things they shouldn't have done, but the rules were stupid and the prisoners didn't know when they were going to be released.  At one point a prisoner was telling his wife how to treat him, because he needed her more than he needed anything else.  As usual, the movie took a long time to tell us what it is about, because it had to be described.  Because the movie had no conclusion, I donít know what it was about.  So I will give a positive rating to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a word: perfect.   It's about two police officers who have a very strange experience when they are out on the road.  I've seen many a police thriller, but I can't say I've ever seen one quite like this one.  If I was to put it simply, it was a movie that reminded me of my favorite movies: Goodfellas, Dirty Harry, etc.  When it comes to police stories, it seems like every year there's a new film coming out that's good, but not really that good.  This one is definitely different from those.  The story and acting is outstanding.  It has great dialog, great camera work, great editing and it really has something for everyone.  All the characters are great.  There's a cop who is a bit of a psychopath, a couple of very nice ladies, and a really good guy.  In fact, everyone is very interesting and interesting characters.  At one point, the cops are out driving in a patrol car.  One of the ladies turns out to be a little girl.  She asks one of the cops if he could borrow his gun.  He says yes.  Then she tries to rob the cop.  For some reason, the cop just kind of allows it to happen.  That's when the bad guy shows up.  Once again, the camera work is great. We see everything through the officers' eyes.  Some of the stuff they see is just amazing.  Unfortunately, most of it is not as good. I wouldn't have minded that much if it weren't for the fact that some of the scenes that the movie takes place in are a little silly.  And for a movie about a cop's worst nightmare, that's saying something.  A few of the episodes are also a little unbelievable.  But, to be fair, they're all well told and really give you a good idea of what a cop is like.  Now, I've already shown you some of my thoughts about the movie, but if you haven't yet watched it, I highly recommend you do that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a little bit confused as to why this is rated PG-13. It's not an action movie. It has little to do with violence. What this movie does is take the idea of an action film, and puts it on ice. Instead of being filled with gunfire, it's filled with slow motion and long takes.   If you enjoyed "The Last Samurai" and "The Hunt for Red October" then you will love this movie.  It's really an interesting take on the action genre.    The acting is just about perfect. I don't know if that's from the script or if there was a great performance from every actor involved.  If I were to compare this movie to a real action movie, I would say that it's a more "action-packed" take on a classic action movie (as opposed to a "bad-ass action movie").

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise of the movie is simple: Two people who want to save a friend from an accident get pulled into an elaborate scam that involves a young girl who becomes a member of a mysterious cult. The plot is not as good as it could have been, but the characters are great and the director has a real eye for detail. The acting is very good and the movie has a lot of heart.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I like the way this movie looks, and I like the sound, and if the plot works, it's one of the better films I've seen."   The best way I can describe the plot is that it's like a good piece of fiction told to a kid in his second grade class about some kids who are hiding in a cave.   Like all great stories there is a beginning, a middle, and an end to it and I guess, you could call it a sequel to some of my favorite stories.  The story itself, as is usually the case in these stories, is quite simple.  After a boy named Sam disappears mysteriously in the middle of the woods, his best friend Mike (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to find the boy and bring him back home to his little sister.  There is nothing new about this story. It's just a simple story told to children about a missing little boy.  In addition to the story, there is nothing really new to find either.  At a certain point, a group of kids are talking and the boys are trying to get the girls to do certain things that they do when they are on the bus.    This is basically the same routine every two to three minutes.  While this is not a bad thing, it does make me wonder if the story was really made for children and not adults, because what's wrong with adults doing this stuff?   This story, however, really took a turn in the third act when they were taking a road trip to a place that was described as "really hot" where Mike and the girls could wear their skirts up and the guys would play basketball.  Now I know there are some people that hate road trips.  I hate road tripping because there is not much to it.  A road trip is the story of two boys, one of them wearing a skirt, trying to find his lost friend.  Once they find him they decide to take a ride in a convertible (I know you are thinking of the old Chevy convertible from Back to the Future).  And that's pretty much it. The only other new thing in the movie is the "hot" part where they all take off their skirts and try to go swimming, but to no avail.  This movie was a hit with the kids at my school and they all told stories about it after it. I also watched this movie with my parents on a rainy night.  My

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story line of this movie is a good one.   This is a story about a woman that has been taken in by her sister.  She is a widow who is being treated for a serious illness.  Her sister gives her a house, but she soon falls in love with a man.  A love for a man that she hates and is angry about.  So it is no surprise that the woman and her sister end up getting into a fight.  This film is not just about this woman, it is about her sister who is the main character.  And it is great that the sister is portrayed as a kind and caring person that does everything she can to help her sister in the face of adversity.  I am just sad that this movie doesn't have any nudity.

It's not a big budget Hollywood blockbuster, but the kids are cute and are well acted. I also liked that it was a film with some good story lines and not just a bunch of kids running around.

I was amazed how much was in this movie. It's the perfect movie for kids. I don't understand the big problems in the world. I understand the problem for the little girl, but my mother is too worried about me being a princess.   The movie was fun, but the story could have been made a little better. But I think it could have worked better if they added some more people to the party and the people who go back to their hometown.

In the beginning we see a normal, quiet and shy boy named Rolf who is looking forward to go to school. He soon learns that it is his chance to get a chance at becoming a hero.  In his school, Rolf meets a girl, the girl who will become his first love and the first person who will help him become a man.

With the help of a wise teacher, he is able to overcome the boy's feelings and realize he is ready to fight the evil that has taken over his country.  He soon joins the army and finds himself with new enemies and a new mission.  The movie was well directed and did a great job of telling the story of Rolf's life and it was full of a lot action.

He loves his family but is a spoiled brat.  It seems to be a typical family movie but there are some twists and turns.  The acting is top-notch all the way around.  This was a very enjoyable family movie.  There is no crying or moaning in this movie, just great acting.  I especially enjoyed the scene where the woman went shopping and came home with a man.  "She is so small, I want to hug her."    I enjoyed this movie as a whole but one little twist here and there could have easily destroyed the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie last night, and I am sorry to say I enjoyed it very much. It is a really nice film, though a little slow. As usual, we have a lot of people in an alien spaceship, but they seem to have been brought in from a different world (in this case the desert planet). It is not an earthlike planet (though it has an arid and windy landscape) but rather a far off world, but a very fascinating place to visit. The characters were great, and the story was really interesting, with a lot to think about and think about about. It did not have a happy ending (as many movies do, though this one had a happier ending than most) but there was no sense of betrayal, or disappointment, or any feeling of guilt at all. It was all quite peaceful and peaceful, with only a few small things (like the alien being very much human-like) that I found a little off, but these minor things didn't have any great influence on the film. This one is a nice, relaxing film to look at (even though you are not really getting out into the desert, at least not like I did) but it is a little more cerebral than some of the other films I have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "If you are a fan of "Fantastic Four," then it's a no brainer that you will love "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" as well. The story has a lot of comedy to it, the special effects are great, and the acting is solid, but it still has that Marvel feel. The plot is about Spider-man (Eddie Brock) and his gang of criminals in a city called New York. They are trying to make a little money. There's a crime syndicate called the Kingpin. But they're all crooks, so it's only a matter of time before the kingpin catches on to that and sends his men after Spider-mann. He gets the help of a bunch of other bad guys including some cops and some of the good guys. But, before long, the Kingpinching, the Spidey Powers, and his friends have to come to the aid of a very angry mayor named Dr. Curt Connors. There are some other interesting aspects to this movie as well, but the most interesting is how Connors and his police force treat the spiderman. This is a good example of the new Spider-Men of New York and New York, New York as a city and it makes the story more enjoyable. And, when Connors' men do try to catch the spider-man, they succeed and it really is great.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been wanting to see this movie for years. It is about a man who is diagnosed with cancer and his family goes to the hospital in his home town to see a surgeon who can cure his cancer. He is a great man and he is trying to make a difference in the world. He thinks that his cancer is going to come back and that there must be a miracle and there is. So, he makes a big deal about a new drug that he has been given that will help him and it does work and he feels better and the family goes back to the doctor. But, when he goes to see the surgeon again he doesn't seem to like him very much and he tells his family to call the doctor, get him out of the house, and not even see him again. But the family decides that this new drug will make them forget about his cancer so they bring him back to see him and he looks like a ghost. They do all kinds of things to get him to go away and he gets angry and tries to hit his wife and then his son and he tries to kill his son. All of these actions make him seem mad. His wife is frightened and she tries to escape the house. But she is unable to escape because she has a gun in her purse. He has a knife and he takes his wife's gun and kills himself with it. Then the family tries to figure out what to do and they decide to go on the road and get rid of the gun so he can't come back. But their car breaks down and they have to walk the entire way back. When they get to his home they find all of his personal belongings in a bag that has a note that says, "I'm sorry I can't stay."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little worried about the plot as it had a lot of science fiction elements to it, but it was actually a very exciting film.   The movie is set in an underground tunnel system in the future.  You're told that there are three main characters.  First is the hero, the head engineer of this project, he has a little sister and a friend who are all under his command.  Second is a girl named Zoe who works as a lab tech for the lab in the lab.  Third is a little boy named Peter who's the "bad guy" who is supposed to be able to open the door to the tunnel.  And then you have the two other characters who are named Sam and Sam's friend, the two of them are the computer experts who use the "computer" to "control" Peter.  There are two main things that are important about this movie.  The first is the fact that this tunnel system was created by scientists and it has a very rich history that is explored, the scientists are trying to bring back certain items or even machines from the past.  It's a really cool and exciting film and it's really great to see a movie based on a movie that I have seen before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a little bit different. I am not a big fan of horror, I never watched a movie like this but it was ok. I think it was a bit cheap but the girl was ok (even though she looked like she is not from this world). So anyway, the movie is called "Necro" and it is a story about a girl named Sarah and a mummy. The mummy was killed by a killer who comes from another dimension and was in a box with her. When she wakes up she realizes she is in the body of a girl. So, of course the other girl (Sarah) becomes her friend and the two get into a kind of love-hate relationship, not much is shown at first and it seems like they are just in love. But of course she needs a body because she is sick and not really like what she sees (and of course there is a curse on the mummy). This is just the first part and they are never able to find a body and eventually they are forced to live together as a couple. There are some pretty cool shots in the first half of the movie but they are not too good. The whole movie is just kind of "meh" like I said but it is not a bad movie at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I had been in love for many years, had four beautiful daughters (two of which were born in the year of our wedding) and lived in a small but very picturesque home with the original three generations of our family.   We had a very busy family life with two wonderful and fun daughters and a big house to fill with furniture, music, toys and memories.  At about the age of 15 we moved to the city.  In the city we were happy with our lives until we discovered a world of music.  Our oldest daughter had a taste for rock music and wanted to go to a concert.  To make a long story short, she traveled to a small country town where the concert was being held.  She had a great time and a great memory.  When she returned home we decided to have a concert for all her friends.  I bought my guitar, the first time in my life.  The band consisted of two teenagers from a nearby town, a couple of young rockers and two other young musicians who were going to play for me.  With my daughters and my mother, we drove up to our friend's house to watch the concert. I knew that I was playing with my daughter.  After the concert the rocker decided he wanted to stay and play for his friends and he was the only musician left in the band.  It was my turn.  They put us on a stage and the music stopped.  We didn't have a chance to think about the fact that we were all alone and that I had no instruments.  Some people don't know that we all had guitar lessons.  This is a great movie.  A young man and a young woman who have been together for quite a long time get a concert together.  Unfortunately it's a night of drunken debauchery but when they go home they fall in love.  Great music, great characters and a very well made film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie.    The story is quite interesting.    I like how there is a story in this movie and it goes on a bit.  It is kind of a different approach in movies.  This movie seems to be more of a social satire about the people that are so obsessed with how to live their lives.  I'm not sure what they are seeing but that does not mean I like it.  They're obsessed with sex.  There is a sexual scene in the middle of the movie. There are a couple of scenes where you think they were making a documentary or something but I don't think so.  The sex scenes are quite erotic and pretty weird.  After I watched this movie I don' t think I will ever watch anything like this again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.  It's very funny, and the scenes with the cat's eyes and the watermelon make me laugh out loud! I love how they put a happy ending at the end so we get to see them eat watermelons and cat's eye smiles for years to come!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a little too dark, and the film is made to be a good mystery, but it's definitely not the best.   For what it is, it's a good little crime movie that could really be made into a television show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's very hard to choose one good thing about this film. First of all the cinematography is spectacular, especially the scenes where the girl and her dad have sex in the forest.    As a viewer, it is hard not to have some sympathy for this girl, who has had so much sexual violence and abuse inflicted on her, and yet is so resilient, and strong. I didn't find it particularly easy to relate to her because she is so different from the typical damsel in distress, but this is a woman who is able to fight her way out of a situation, and survive.  One of the many reasons for this is the performance by Jennifer Aniston, who played a part of a young woman who doesn't seem to be able to change.  This film is very well made, with well written dialogue and a great cast.  I really like this movie, and I have seen it in the theater a few times, but my first viewing was long after it was released, and the film is worth a revisit.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's about time somebody gave a new generation of kids a good laugh with a movie so funny that not only did I find it funny, but also so beautiful to watch. The story is about a group of kids who make a huge mess on the school yard, so they decide to take off all the other kids' clothes to get the teacher's attention. The teachers go back to the girls' locker room and there's a big thud and a little girl comes running out and she says "Look what I've made!" I'm sure you'd love this movie if you are a kid and are really into dressing up.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie that I found very entertaining. This is the type of comedy that you'll want to watch again and again. The dialogue is very funny. And the humor works great. The action scenes are great. And we get to know the characters very well. The only down side is the lack of action in later parts of the movie. Overall  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent movie. The film, like the original, focuses on a father and a daughter that are on a mission to find the mystical Golden Lotus, which contains the secrets of immortality. But, the film has been made a bit better than its first (1972), as its story and characters are more well developed. This is a film with a bit of a darker side, but its overall impact is much greater than the original.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did not expect to like the film that much. After reading the synopsis I was expecting a simple comedy with a little romance thrown in.  I can honestly say it wasn't a good comedy, or even a good romantic film.  This is just a really bad film.   I found it hard to keep a straight face most of the time.   In fact the first half was just a series of bad jokes that just kept repeating.  There was nothing funny in the film. Nothing of any substance.  It is just dull.  The music was terrible too, especially when the two women kiss.  They were really bad at kissing.    I just felt like the writer was trying to be all cute and funny but I could not get into it at all.  A couple of times I wished they would have let the two guys kiss but I guess if you are going to go to Hollywood they should hire some good actors.  When I first saw the film, I was ready to laugh but I couldn't do it.  As I am writing this review I'm not sure why I liked this film. I don't think I would recommend this film to a friend.  I was not expecting much from this film, but I was still intrigued enough to go in.   It was an ok film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good, fun, but also a sad movie about a boy who finds himself in a strange world with his mother and father, with a new baby sister.   I thought this was a nice story about a family, a girl and a little boy.      The boy, Noah (Hugh Dancy) is a baby and is a bit of a clumsy and clumsy boy. His parents are very strict and do not want anything done to him.  I liked Noah's mom (Juliette Lewis) and father (Richard Jenkins).   They are both nice, they are both very good, and they are all very likeable.   Juliete Lewis' (l) and Richard Jenkins' (r) new baby, Noah.  I liked how this movie had a dark twist and a very happy ending.  You don't want to read this as a fairy tale.  But then you watch it, and it becomes about a girl (the heroine) who falls in love with a boy (Humphrey Bogart), and I thought it was very nice to see a movie like this.  It is very hard to make a movie that is like this because it is so difficult to do.  Noah has many problems, and he is sad.  As far as I know, the movie takes place in the early 20th century and Noah is an orphan who lives in a little cabin with his sister. He is very lonely and he cannot be happy because he has no family.  He is a sweet little boy and I felt he was very happy to see his mother.  When Noah was a baby, he fell into a river and was pulled out and found by his sister, Eve (Katherine Langford).  The mother did not want Noah to have a sister and Eve took him in.  Eve and Noah play together, and Noah makes lots of friends with them.  This brings me to the sadness, or, the lack of sadness.  If there were more scenes that made you sad, I would be really mad at myself.  For example, when Noah was in bed and a friend of the mother, the girl played his piano for him. The next day, Noah was at the piano and he did not know what to do with his new piano.   Noah did not play very well, so his sister played and the mother and some of the family went to see her play. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would definitely go see this movie again.   This was a well made movie and well acted.  There were some great character development and I really liked some of the dialogue.  I loved the story and the characters and what I was seeing is the future of our world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As you can see, I don't have much of a love for the film   and yet, I find it a decent movie.   The plot isn't really all that interesting and yet it's still a good watch.  For what it's worth, I like the idea of a boy/girl being locked in a house in the woods, and then suddenly, a huge, beautiful, magical, evil tree pops out of the ground, killing the boy and giving the girl the power to control it.  The tree is the product of a man's imagination (he created it with a bottle of gasoline he found, I believe), and it was created as a punishment for a girl who committed a murder.  Well, that girl was a girl with a gift (like a power-up) that allowed her to control the tree, but that's where the similarities end.  After she is trapped inside the tree and the powers that she gained become useless, she has no choice but to fight her way back out.  Now, if I'm being completely honest with you, this is a very generic movie. It has no personality.  I think it's very obvious that these two characters are going to end up together after a little while (for reasons that seem like they are purely out of character), and yet I find the film very unconvincing.  Sure, you get a little bit of story-stuff, but the story does nothing to help the movie along.  But, if you love a movie that involves a very creepy tree, then by all means, watch this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It doesn't do much for me, it does a good job of getting to know a lot about the characters and the world. It gives a good idea about where you're at in your life in terms of what it means to be a soldier and the rest of the movie just continues to show that point. It doesn´t hold your hand at all and it doesn't make you love any of the characters in the story. It also doesn´T give the story much depth or any real emotion or something that makes you want to care about anything. It´s mostly about soldiers who are in a war that they don´t understand and are a little bit frustrated with the fact that they just don´T understand a lot of things and it´s really hard to feel anything for the main characters. But it´S one of those movies that has a certain charm to it and a great story to tell and the best part of the story is when you learn a little about the world and the people of that place and you feel a little sadness at how little the people there know about each other and it makes you wonder if they could even stand up to the same things and the same threats that the Germans are capable of.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie, although a little too long.   The characters were all likable, and I like the little comical touches of this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to give props to this film.   It really is the best I have seen in a long time.  The plot is quite simple but the characters are quite amazing and the ending is amazing.  And I have never seen a movie that is so dark at the same time as this one.  It is really hard for me to find a good place to say this movie is a masterpiece, I'm not even sure if this movie belongs on this site but I love it and I don't mind to admit it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The way the movie unfolds is a pretty good one. There's a reason why I think it is a classic. I loved the story, the way the music was used to set the mood (which was awesome, by the way), the acting, the direction (which I thought was pretty good for a film by a non-professional), the photography. It all added to the mood of the movie. I think most people would find it interesting, with enough laughs to keep the whole thing going. If you are a movie person (or like to watch movies) you really should check this out. You're in for a treat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie of all time. I can't imagine how much it had to do with the success of the TV series and of course the other shows in the series. It's a very good show with some good special effects. This one is the best I have seen. I love the fact that the characters are such good people and I love all the scenes between Jim Carey, Julie Newmar, Michael Rooker and Jeff Corey. I also love the way they all get their own special effects and when a couple of characters have to be killed off, it's done with a real sense of urgency.   A must have for all fans of the tv series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is fun, a good little laugh and a nice break from all the gloom and gloom. The characters and plot are interesting. Some will probably find this movie to be a little boring but I think that's a good thing, it means we don't have to hear about "Molly" a woman who has a really bad attitude towards life who is basically always running up and down stairs yelling about "it's not a choice" and the like. It would be good if this movie were more funny, more interesting but I found the characters and story to be enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like any film it's always good. I mean, I've seen a lot of movies... and I've found that one of the better comedies out there.   It does have a lot going for it. You've got an older guy who's always getting his butt handed to him by girls.  You've also got a group of young kids that are always getting into a lot trouble, but they eventually do get themselves into the middle of some bigger problems.    That's really the only negative of this film.  The other kids and the teacher never really get into the story.  That's a good thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see the new Batman movie, Man of Steel. It's good, and it's good by my standards. The character is the best part of it. I don't think it's that much of a departure from the past two Batman movies, but it's still interesting. The characters are well written, and the effects are great. The action is more or less what I expected from the last two Batman films. It's a nice change of pace from the usual. The ending was pretty good, too.   Overall, it's a good Batman movie with some good comic-book style. I wish it were longer, but at least it's fun.

I was surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat, a little bit scared but the movie was a good one. It's one of the first horror films I saw. The atmosphere was very eerie and creepy. The movie was directed by the great Robert Wise and the film was a very good one and the movie didn't hold my interest in the end. It is just a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first time seeing a movie about a boy and his dog was a pleasant surprise. This movie is based on a true story from the 19th century, which was well researched and told. My only criticism is that it does get a bit too long and it can get tedious at times. There are lots of things that happened in the story but it gets repetitive. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a dog who wants a good yarn!

In my opinion, I'm a big fan of all films by James Cameron, especially the ones that have a futuristic theme, which are "Avatar" and "The Terminator". I didn't like the "Avatara" movie. I'm glad to find that this one has been released on DVD.  This film is very well-done. The plot is good. I really don't know what happened in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Dark Knight" (2012) was a terrific film about a man who becomes a vigilante to fight crime in Gotham City, a city run by an evil corporation, which holds the residents hostage. It was an exciting watch, a very good action-packed thriller, one that kept you on the edge of your seat even when the movie slowed down a bit, and was full of action scenes and fantastic visuals.   The movie opens with a scene that was a little too over-the-top for my tastes (the movie was set in the year 2114, so I guess we're looking at the future, but I wasn't really sure what it was), but otherwise, the movie was a blast.  "Dark Knight" is the story of Bruce Wayne (Michael Caine), a young man from a broken home in Gotham, where he is a bit of a loner. His father, Thomas Wayne (the late Heath Ledger) died when he was just a baby. Bruce was taken in by his mother Martha (Rosario Dawson), a wealthy woman who lives in Gotham. Bruce decides that he needs to find a way to change the way things are in Gotham from the way they have been since the murder of his father by the mobster (Tommy Lee Jones). In order to do this, Bruce begins training under the mentor of his hero, James Gordon (Gary Oldman) of Gotham police department, who is Bruce's new mentor. Bruce wants to be able to protect the citizens of Gotham from mob violence and illegal activities of people who hold a great deal of power. He is a very smart guy, but is a little naïve and naive.  The best of the gang:  Caine played Bruce Wayne really well, and Dawson was fantastic as his mother.  Oldman was also terrific in the role of Gordon. It's tough to say who was the best in this movie, since it was all so enjoyable.  As far as performances go, I think I have to go with Caine. He was great in this role.  I will also go with Dawson. She did a terrific job, although her character got a bit too old for me to care about her.  However, Oldman's performance and Dawson's performance were probably the best of their respective careers.  Cate Blanchett was also great as the mob's henchwoman, the mysterious Selina Kyle (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Jon Favreau was
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a very enjoyable movie, and is very funny at times.   The movie is about a man (Mike) who is going to a new city to live for a while, but soon gets stuck in his car for an extended period of time, and as the night progresses, a strange woman shows up and he learns that she is very interested in a young guy (John).   We don't know much about John (he is a very weird guy), and he gets a lot of bad press for the way he behaves at work.  He is an odd and quite eccentric person in a bad mood. But this does not last long and we start to get to know him as the film progresses.  We are soon getting a better picture of John, and a very funny and sad story unfolds.  I found this to be a very positive movie, with a good plot and a funny story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very well-made movie about an American soldier and his family. The movie portrays a typical American soldier family - from a father, to a mother, to their son. The father (Frank Conniff) is an alcoholic and is a loser, while his son (Christopher Plummer) is in love with the local girl (Eugene Levy). The movie's main message is to help you overcome your addiction to alcohol, to see the real value of a person by giving them a second chance, and for the soldier to realize how much the Army could really change his life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first time watching this movie   It was amazing. I was really excited to see this film when I read the synopsis. I have never seen this movie and I was so disappointed.   This movie does not have any of the excitement that I am used to from sci-fi.  It starts off with a really bad alien and then he goes from bad to worse. The alien is not even scary in the beginning and then when he gets angry and tries to kill the human he has no interest in his person.  He just wants to kill people. Then we come to a spaceship. And we get a good explanation of what the ship is. The ship is supposed to go somewhere. A place where the humans live. But when we first see the ship there are no humans there. The humans are on their death beds and so the ship wants to go home but they have a problem. The human beings on the ship have something that the aliens have not. The only thing they have to do to get home is they have have to take a sample of human sperm.  That is all the movie needed. It was so lame to see these people going through life. And it took up so much time. It had a very lame ending.  So my favorite part of the movie is the ending. The aliens do everything to get human sperm and they succeed in their quest.  I would watch this movie again just to see how the aliens get human semen. But this is not a very good movie  And the ending was terrible

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is no denying the fact that this film has a lot to offer, so much so that you would have a hard time finding a negative aspect to discuss. The performances are a hit or miss, with the exception of Peter O'Toole and his superb performances, but they hardly feel out of place as they are just about on par with what you could expect from the greats like James Stewart and Richard Burton. It does not try to be anything more, or less, than a fun and well-done fantasy adventure, and if you are looking for a good popcorn movie to watch with your friends, this is your movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of the series, I was thrilled to see this movie at Cineplex, an upscale theatre in the heart of downtown Vancouver.   With a beautiful soundtrack by Danny Elfman, this was the perfect ending to the first film.  I'm sure many will agree. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the second installment in the Alien franchise after the first movie. The second movie had a better story and an even better action.    The plot is about a spaceship, the Nostromo, crash landing on a moon. The crew of this ship, led by Dr. Malcolm (Michael Biehn) and his wife Elizabeth (Frances Farmer), discover a living space race, the crew of the Xenomorphs (or Xenomorph-like aliens).   I like the way they handle the Alien, it isn't so gory in the movie, it's not scary, it has a lot more to say.  Alien is a character study. He isn't just a monster with a head. He is a person and a human in his own right, he has a past, he's afraid of his own shadow.  He's a human being who is made into a monster to get a job, a job that he does not want.  His wife does all he can to protect him.  Even though there are many scenes in this movie that are not that good, this movie has a better ending than the previous movie and it really made me want to see what happened to Dr. Marcus (Sam Neill) after that accident in the first Alien movie.  The Nostromos get some help from a couple of human survivors.  This helps the alien, but he is still a monster and he still does a lot of damage to the Nostramo.  While there are some great scenes in the film, there are others that are a bit boring.  After watching this movie, I can't wait to see the second movie, so that we can see Dr. Malcom (Biehn) again and find out what happens to him. There are some scenes with Elizabeth that I enjoyed, but we don't get much insight into what she is thinking about at any time.  I hope the movie will give me a good reason to get the second one.  5/5

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A story about a young man who lives a fairly normal life in the small town of Mardini in Southern Italy, except that one day, he learns that his childhood friend was killed in a plane crash just before Christmas. What a terrible thing to find out! He then decides that the only way to pay his respects to his friend is to create a new life for the spirit of his dead friend in a remote village. With little to no help from his family, he goes to live at the Mardim house. There he must work the farm to provide for himself and his little sister.   The movie had very good acting from the lead actor, Robert Wagner (a role that his father had previously played), and good production values.  The film has some problems, such as the lack of direction, and some of the scenes were repetitive.

I saw it at a midnight show, and at the end I went up to ask the show manager where the next movie was, thinking he was kidding. I was surprised to find out that the next show was a long one. I didn't understand why the film was running so long, but I think it was a real pity that the ending was so long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The biggest problem with the movie was that the characters were extremely stereotypical. The female lead, who is about a year older than the guy, is quite boring, which makes it hard to relate to her character. Her husband is very nice to her and he treats her like a young daughter. Her younger sister, who looks and acts like a younger girl, is an annoying little brat who wants to be famous and act like a man. The man who owns the mansion, who can't get it up, and who constantly has sex in the house with the girl is a bit of a bully and an embarrassment to the family. The guy with the nice wife is the perfect guy, who has no ambition, but is actually quite happy with himself. The main girl is sweet, and a bit vain, but has a heart of gold.    As for the plot, it's pretty bland and very predictable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like any movie I really enjoyed it.   I think it's a very good movie but I can't say it's the best.  I thought it was a very interesting story.  It's like a mix between the old ghost stories, the old sci-fi and even some ghost stories.  There are plenty of supernatural elements that I really liked.  They seem to play a part in every story in this movie.  All these things seem to be happening around a little girl that has to deal with her parents' disappearance and how the little girl will go on with her life after this.  The movie is pretty good and not just a typical ghost story.

The ending scene in the theater after the movie was over was so good that I almost cried with the tears that filled my eyes. This movie is a classic that should be watched again and again by everyone in order to get a good laugh out of the comedy, but also the tragedy and sadness.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of the movie is really good, but the second half is totally bad.   This movie's second half sucks, no pun intended.  While the first half is awesome, the second is awful.  I don't really care what other reviewers say about the movie's plot, but this is a bad movie at heart.  The story is boring, and it has no real plot.  If there was an episode of an animated TV show, it'd have to be called  Bizarro World    - the movie was like a "How I Met Your Mother" episode.  When the movie gets into the final half, it starts to get good, and I thought it was a pretty good movie.  And it has a lot of good ideas about how a video game can be used as a way to interact with a person.  It might be hard to understand, but that is what this movie is about.  This isn't a movie for people who want to see something they've never seen before.  For me, I was completely sucked into the movie, but I couldn't care less about the final result.  After the credits rolled, I felt like I was watching a shitty reality show.  Now I'm going to go to bed.  Recommended: I have no idea what to say about this movie. This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see a few of these movies at a theater not far from my home. This movie is good. Very good, in fact, in my opinion. The dialogue was not very clever, but it was good enough. Very well done. I am glad to see that a movie like this is still available in the United States.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie has an interesting story to tell. There is plenty of violence, but I think it is just enough to set up the theme of the film.   I think I had more fun than I was able to at the movies that I have seen so far this year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the most realistic story of a guy who lives alone, who lives in a small village and who works at a small local shop. And he gets very excited when he discovers a giant turtle. Then the turtle gets killed by some dogs and he goes looking for the turtle in a nearby pond. When he finds it, he says that it is not a turtle but a human being. And the human is very friendly and the turtles personality is very kind and sensitive.   But, the real magic happens when the human says a really nice thing to the turtle.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I'm going to go on record as saying that I loved the film "Titanic."   After watching the movie it was pretty clear that the director did a great job.   The film did a fantastic job of portraying the tragedy of the day, the heartbreak of the death of Elizabeth, and the devastation of the loss of the life of Jack.  The characters were well defined and you could relate to them in a way that made the movie as great as it was.  This is not an easy movie to watch.  It takes you in a lot of different directions.  One of the most important aspects of this movie is the soundtrack, which was very good.  There were only three songs in the whole movie, but they were all pretty good. I had never really listened to the soundtrack before, but it really did not hinder my enjoyment of the movie in any way.  I really liked the "Rockets" song that played in the film, and it had a nice little rock song feel to it.  A nice song and a nice scene.  Overall, this movie really had a very good time and I would highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen a movie like this in a long time, in fact it is a bit frightening how well this movie can capture our fears and imagination.   It is a scary and wonderful movie.  The plot involves a group of five students who have gone missing during a night of fun in the woods and the hunt begins.  It has a supernatural quality with some great acting, a nice twist in the plot, and a lot of good scary movie fun.  I watched the original on blu ray and the 3D enhanced edition and had to buy a new set of ear buds to get the 3d effect.  This is a must see for anyone who likes scary movie entertainment, I give this movie a 10/10 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An odd comedy about a group of misfits who take a job in a small town to be an extra in a comedy movie. The director tries hard to get a laugh out of them but it isn't worth it. They don't seem to get what they're doing but you won't believe what happens to them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a good adventure movie with a good story. The story has great plot, but it is not the greatest of the movies in the whole movie. It is a story about a girl who has a strange habit. Her name is Aaliyah and she lives a lonely life. She is a girl with no friends and never really goes out. Her friends are a girl named Zayde and her neighbor Elaina. They all help Aali. However she has a problem of the girls always finding a way to tease and annoy her. It turns out that Aali does not have a real good friends because her friends are always messing with her. Her dad died a few years ago and now her parents live with her mom. She does not like her mom because her mom always takes away her toys. She likes her dad, but she doesn't like him like that at all. So when Aali and her dad go on a trip to a mysterious castle, they are met with a few funny characters. These characters give fun little adventures and Aali is the best girl. It gets a little crazy and funny when it gets really weird and weird when these guys get involved with one of the other girls. It all kind of turns out pretty good. It doesn't get too crazy like some of the more crazier movies I have seen and it is pretty funny at times. I am glad I watched it and I hope it gets more love and attention and it will get a sequel.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised by the movie.   One of the reasons I like the series so much is the fact that they really do a good job of setting up a believable and engaging narrative.  For me it was a very easy story to follow.  The plot is pretty straight forward.  What I really liked about this story was the fact they were able to show the characters of the past and present.  It was nice to see their struggles, their fears, their aspirations.  While I do not remember the exact details, I remember a scene when one of them was in a hospital and the other was in the back seat of a car.  They both wanted to help and be a part of something.  If you like historical fiction, I think this movie is a good choice for a time period you are interested in.  I enjoyed it so much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie "The Last Samurai" is a little movie that I liked a lot.  It's a good little movie.   It has a good ending.  The story is good, not too long and not too good.  When I was a kid I always wanted to become a Samurai.  Now that I am over 50 I don't get to see a lot of good Samurai movies but I can see why they are so popular.  I was very surprised to find out that "The last Samurai" isn't actually a historical movie. I was surprised by that.  No historical accuracy.  For me I really like historical accuracy in movies.  To me history is the greatest teacher and I enjoy watching movies that make you understand something about history.  "The final Samurai" doesn't do much to show off the history of Japan or the Samurai. It does a good job of showing that samurai were not all about killing and stealing.  If you are looking for a good historical movie "the last Samurai's" a good place to start is "Avengeance" or "Kampaku" (I like the English dub, it's a little different than the Japanese one).  I'll give a little bonus for this movie. In the beginning of the movie you will see a picture of a famous statue, the one on the left.  In the picture there is a sword lying next to a woman who has fallen down, but it's not the real Samurai sword.  At the beginning, the Samurai's are supposed to be sitting around talking and laughing.  Later in the movie they start to fight.  And it doesn't end well for them.  A good movie for all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are only a few things I like about this movie. First, a beautiful film. I found the cinematography to be absolutely stunning, and I am always blown away by beautiful cinematography in films. The story was also pretty good, and the cinemas were beautiful.   "My name is Harry. I am in love. And you. You were in love with me when we first met. You are in love now, aren't you?" The whole movie was very cute, and it was quite charming. I do like it when cute movies come out.  The romance was also cute, so I was a happy camper.  The best part about the movie was the lovey dovey relationship between Harry and the girls.  I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more if the romance was a bit more obvious in the beginning of the movie.  It is really a pity, because the two main characters were so cute!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dueling Banjos is a film that I would recommend to anybody, from children to grownups who love the cowboy spirit.   The story is based on the life of an American rodeo rider, John Wayne.  But the film does not have a hero. Instead, a man tries to be a good man.  He is forced to put aside his love of riding for the sake of his young children.  After all, a good cowboy is a hard man to kill."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie. I am glad I saw this. I don't watch a lot of movies these days because they don't have the same heart or passion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good:  You can never go wrong with a fun time at a amusement park.   A bunch of fun times are had, including some fun songs.  The characters are not so much likable as they are just a little too funny.  I wouldn't mind taking my little boy there again, and if my little girl wanted to, I wouldn?t mind the ride as long as the ride was fun.  It really doesn?t seem that it was a bad movie by any means.  Would I watch this again? Sure, maybe, just to see the same thing from different eyes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm gonna be honest: this movie was not the easiest movie to watch. I was expecting the whole movie to be a straight-to-video horror movie, because of the trailer, but it wasn't the case. There was a little gore, which I did enjoy, but most of the movie I was watching a really good horror film. I also loved the ending. I'm a sucker for these kind of movies, so to say I didn't like this movie is a huge understatement. I would suggest that you to watch the trailer first and if it doesn't catch your eye then you're probably not interested.   Recommended for fans of good horror films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't really care about this movie until the end...but, I guess it's more a question of how much I liked the film.   At a minimum, the film is a good time.  It is a silly movie that, while very silly, has a fun and enjoyable plot, though the ending is a little unsatisfying.  One last thing, I found it amusing that the kids and the dog were wearing the same clothes every day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first saw the movie back in 1997, and at that time I had a great admiration for the director and cast. The movie has some really good performances and some really silly scenes, and is fun to watch at times. The main character is played by the excellent David Arquette. He seems to be a very interesting character, and some of his lines are absolutely hilarious. The other lead roles are played by two other good actors in a pretty decent movie. But the real stars of the movie are the two lead actresses, and you have to remember that they were the original stars of their television series. The two actresses are very talented, and their characters have a lot of fun.   It is a good time for comedy, but you have no idea how much of a funny movie this is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to say that this is the second "real" science fiction film, the first being  . I like the way they did the aliens.   They have little mouths that stick out of their head, and if you want to see it they are pretty small.  They are a little like little balls of rubber.  It is not clear how this was even made. It is a bit odd, and some of the alien's costumes are a bit silly. I can see a lot of film-making in it.  There are some very nice effects on the ship, and the aliens are not to be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is good and the humor is a bit old school with a modern twist.

I enjoyed this a lot!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the second movie I have watched in a row that has reminded me a lot of  Dances with Wolves,  the first being the movie "Ain't No Mountain High Enough",  which I never liked, but at least had some kind of a good story to it,  Dancers with Wolves  was a pretty bad movie, but it's one that I have seen a lot lately, so I have more reason to like it.   My wife and I watched this one on a Saturday morning.  I watched the first one about ten years ago on a flight to Orlando.  The second one is set in California about a week before a snowstorm, and while the movie is pretty good at times,  it really feels like an excuse to see the bad guys, and the bad guy in this movie is the sheriff.  If you like a good bad guy, this is the movie for you.  It's very hard to find a good villain in any movie,  I'm not saying the movie isn't good.  But I'm telling you a bad guy is hard to pull off, they don't come across well in most movies,  it was especially hard to get the bad cop  into this one, so he comes across as a little pathetic.  This movie has an interesting twist at the end,   The guy who is trying to kill the sheriff is a man who has been trying to get rid of his wife  for a long time, so that's why she would leave him and take her husband's name,  he doesn't have a reason to hate the sheriff, he just wants her out of his life.  He was supposed to be the one who would take revenge on the sheriff for his treatment of his first wife and child, but  the sheriff, and his family were also on his hit list.    He was an ex-con and had spent a lot  of time in prison.  The sheriff had been trying for a while to kill him and finally did it in this bad movie.  And then he did it because he didn't want the wife to take her last name.  There is a small subplot where the sheriff  is trying  to get his daughter out of trouble,  But it's not very interesting,  and it's hard to see why he would want to get her out,  she's pretty much the only thing he has left. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I have seen "My Dinner with Andre" twice now in the theaters we attended together and both times we have been amazed by this film. When we saw this movie at our first showing, I was immediately struck by how different this was than some of the other films of its kind. This film has a very authentic atmosphere that does not take you out of the real world. The film is actually a combination of both the American and Russian modes of film making. In these modes the director can create a very interesting and sometimes amusing film but he must not take himself too seriously in this manner as if it were all a joke. There is also a lot of drama and an almost comic tone to the film which made it somewhat entertaining. This was, of course, a big hit at the time of its release and the film is still quite good in the eyes of some people and more than adequate for an older crowd. There have been many other movies of this kind since and most are pretty terrible but at least "My Lunch" is still a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise of this film is simple: a girl's boyfriend has been in jail since he attacked a police officer. During the sentencing, she has a dream that he will get out and she's going to give him a present: a beautiful diamond that will make him happy forever. Now, how will this happen?   This film is all about love and beauty, love and happiness, love for your friends and love for the world. The best way to describe it would be a fairy tale with a dark ending.   A very charming film, this film has many great scenes, it has a happy ending and a very dark one too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It has a solid story, well played with excellent acting by the lead, and excellent production value.  It's also a little campy at times, but it's in a good way.  The story is about the death of a friend of a father who died in a plane crash, and how it affects the friend's son.  This is one of those movies that you want to see, but you just can't bring yourself to watch it for the sake of entertainment.  I don't mean to come off as being a huge snob or snobbery here, I just think I can say with a great amount of confidence that this movie is absolutely fantastic, and I'm sure many many of you feel the same way.

If you like to watch action and like to see how men and women fight in a war, then you will enjoy it!   There is a story line that has you in awe as to how they fight in the battlefield. It is a good thing they were allowed to use some guns and they make a lot of noise! It's a real story and it is very entertaining.   The main character of the movie is very likable and a good character to have in a movie. I was really surprised at how well he was written. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you're a little boy and you're told that a big-breasted woman is coming for your mother, you're going to let her have it. The whole film is about how you're gonna fight for your life. And by you and your family. It's the story of a boy who's a loner with a little bit of magic, and who's not afraid of a big, bad wolf. It all happens to his mom, and by that he means his dad. The girl is very much a product of the early 1950's (I'm sorry for the bad pun) movie-star era, and is definitely an actress with a big chest who likes to have her way with him. But he is not afraid to use the good sword of justice when he needs to. The film's climax is just awesome.

Yes, the guy who is constantly humiliated by his brother? You know he's the smart one, but has no idea of the tricks that are coming, and then has to suffer? That's right, it's that same guy.   He starts the movie with a bad attitude, and is rude to the police captain, but he does it with the utmost confidence, and tells them that he will help them solve the case. And he does! Not only does he help, but doesn't know the first thing about the case, which leads to a disaster.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not expect anything better from a movie from this year that was all about a couple of young girls who are from poor backgrounds who get caught up in a life that is not so easy.   The movie tells of a story about the adventures of two girls, one a typical delinquent girl who likes to fight, one of a typical "normal" girl who does not care about any of that.  They meet when one is at a party on the weekend with her friends, one is a pretty girl, but a bit of trouble with the police leads her to the police station, where her friends take her in.  The second girl is a typical, everyday girl who cares about her friends and tries to make their life better than her own.  When she hears about a boy who can "see" things (which is what people mean by "power") she is intrigued and so the story goes.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but that can happen in movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .. .  I love this film!   The cast is so diverse, and they are all amazing.   When the movie was released in 2002, I was so excited for it because it was one of the first things I saw, and the film has stuck with me for years.  The film is really beautiful, and a great example of the way the world has moved on.  It has a fantastic plot line, but it is not perfect.  If it weren't for the wonderful score, I could not recommend this movie.  I do recommend this film, it has it all: a really good romance, a great plot line (that is constantly getting better), and one of my favorite performances (from a great actor).   I would love to see this film in 3D!  I really recommend this! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, I can not remember where I saw it or who the actor was but it was one of the better comedies of the 80's. It had a unique premise about a couple who move to a small village and soon run afoul of the townies. This movie was not quite what I thought it was about. It was a bit cheesy and the actors did a good job in the movie. I hope someone like this movie a little more when it is on DVD.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This movie reminded me of those good old '70s-80s films where you're always watching a film in one location and then the film suddenly changes locations. The action was excellent, the acting was superb, and the movie is funny. I liked this movie because it was really fast paced and I really like the dialogue.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an old school man.   That is to say, I'm a fan of everything about the 80's.  It was when my childhood hero, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was still alive and kicking.  I had no interest in what was going on in Hollywood, so when I got into a cheap independent movie called "The Last Dragon" (yes, it had dragons in it), I was like a kid at a candy store.  In a very short period of time, Schwarzenegger's body was transformed from a 6'4" 275 pound man into an imposing 6'6" 220 pound man. In the first 20 minutes of the film, the entire cast and crew was reduced to an unrecognizable, sweaty, and exhausted mess.  While it may have had its flaws, this is still a must see if you want to see Arnold in action.  For a man who is such a huge fan of comic books, it's rather ironic that one of the worst comic book movies ever made has managed to capture Arnold's acting ability in a completely realistic way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching this movie in my junior year of college. It was a comedy with lots of laughs and funny lines that I could understand without a lot of effort. The only reason it's on this list is because I don't really care for the movie (not much). It's about two guys who run a convenience store called "Smokey Joe's". When they go to visit the family of one of their customers, a little boy named "Joey" they get a nasty surprise. Joey doesn't have a tooth and needs to go to the dentist. Smokes Joe knows of the child and offers to take him to the boy's house to help him. Smokers Joe is a bit of a bully and makes Joey work really hard and is the only one who comes to the party to be mean to Joey. Smiles Joe is good at his job. After Joey gets a cavity filled, Smokes decides he has to leave and comes up with a way to get Joey to do his chores for him. He offers Joey money if he will give him a few weeks of work. Joey goes along with it but in the process comes up against a group of friends who are upset that Smokes has left them hanging. Joey and his friends get into a lot trouble because of this but eventually, he is able to make peace with his friends and it doesn't look like Smokes is coming back. The best thing about this movie is that it's hilarious. The movie makes you laugh out loud and that's a good sign that it was a good idea. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a classic Hollywood film. The movie follows the life of Jack Nicholson in the 1960s. Nicholson portrays a bad man who has lost his sense of direction. He is also a great romanticist and gets a girlfriend who has a crush on him. Nicholson keeps flirting and talking about how beautiful his girlfriend is, while she seems to be a complete idiot.   The film is not too great, but it is still fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so thrilled to see this one, it's about a woman named Mrs. Aloysius who has had a terrible accident and is in a vegetative state, but tries to come out of her coma one day by being a super hero and saving a kitten. It's a good film and a funny one, I didn't laugh once and was sad when they brought her home, but then she had the best voice performance I've ever heard from a man (a very good performance). I didn't like this movie at all, but I liked it better than the original Aloysi and still liked the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie, although not a bad movie by any means, does have a few bad things about it. First of all, I don't understand how people would like a movie with the "dumb blonde" (as they say in the movie) and the "black woman". These people are just plain stupid and annoying. And not to mention, the movie does have an unprofessional, amateurish quality to it.    But to say that the movie is bad is an understatement. I guess the reason why people would think this movie is good is because the director is so nice and seems like a great guy. But this movie makes absolutely no sense to anyone who has never seen it or read the book before. And it isn't even funny.  This is the most unprofessional movie I have ever seen.  But if you want a "mature" movie that has a lot of "funny moments", I recommend this movie for you. But I don' t think it is worth your time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see this movie at the Cinema City in Hollywood and I must say, I was impressed with the movie.     I think the movie takes a realistic approach to the human condition.  As a matter of fact, it does not have any supernatural aspect but I think that it is very interesting.  The movie is very funny and good.      The story is very realistic and the characters are real.  They do not act like they are trying to escape but they really are.  It is really a good look into the human world and I will definitely watch it again.  I also found the music to be very beautiful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a way I'm sorry that this movie is not a real movie. I love a good drama. If I wanted a good story I would have taken a train to see this movie. The best part is the ending and I loved the whole movie with out a single second missing. It's a good film with a good plot. The ending to the movie is a perfect scene. It was so good to see the film ending. But I'm sure it would have been better if the ending was a bit more. I know that this is a drama with many characters and they all have to die in one way or another but I think the characters should have died together and then the movie could have ended. I feel sorry that the film ended on a good note because I would of loved to see it continue. The only bad thing about this movie are some people talking about it being a good thriller but the best part of this movie was not the thriller but how the characters felt in the last scene and how they were all together and I'm glad that this film ends with a perfect ending. This movie had a really good storyline and a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Good :   - The film is great.   I really liked the movie because it was a story about an assassin in the 1920's, and the main character had a very well written character.  This is the first time I watch a movie like this and it was fun.  Also the music in the movie was very good.  It was very well acted and the acting was very great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent little thriller. I love that the film is about a man who loses his father in a car accident and a young female hitchhiker who becomes his partner. They travel around on a motorbike until the crash when they arrive at a village where the inhabitants have some very strange ideas about how their new found friends should behave. The story moves from there and the young lady has an interest in the older man, they seem to fall in love very quickly but soon they discover that they are both victims of a murderous scheme. A must see for those who love a good mystery and who are fascinated by the odd people and strange ways of life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was introduced to The Exorcist when it was a new release on home video in the early 90's. The opening credits were quite funny, but when the film started I was left shocked. My brother and I loved it then. It was really an exciting movie, a real classic.   It was filmed in the United States, on location, and was an excellent production.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A pretty good horror film, with decent gore and a decent sense of atmosphere. There's a lot going on here but it all makes sense in the end. If you're not afraid of seeing an old lady get hit with a shovel and then get hit again by a shovel then this might be the right movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Mockingbird" movie that we are all familiar with, but also a film that is more about the character of Mockingbird and how her pasts and lives and how they have shaped her into who she is today.   You should have seen the trailers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Carnival" was an interesting idea to try to make a movie about an amusement park and it failed miserably at all three levels: 1) A carnival ride is just boring.   2) I was expecting a much better movie than this.  3) The script wasn't good either.  The whole movie felt like a TV version of "Grave of the Fireflies"    There is a carnival in town, the rides are good but they are nothing special and the scenery is pretty ugly. The movie starts out in a fairly interesting way but it slowly devolves into a slow-paced, boring ride with bad acting, bad direction and lousy writing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed "Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace."   It is a well put together and well acted story that has a lot of emotional impact.   This movie was based on a story by George Lucas.    This movie had a lot to say and a lot left unsaid about the past, the present, and what is in store for the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new take on a classic.   I just finished watching the whole of the film and found a whole lot to like about it.  The story has lots of action and mystery and is well paced and there are a lot of great characters.  It's very entertaining to watch.  There's a real sense of danger in this film and while I wasn't the biggest fan of the villain, he still manages to be menacing and scary.  A lot of people will probably find the ending a little disappointing but I think it's for the best.  This is a movie you'll want to take along to your friend's house on a hot summer's evening and then afterwards you can sit in your lawn chair and read a book under a warm blanket. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a huge fan of the Twilight series, so it was great to come to this adaptation with a lot of the original cast and to see such a different take on the franchise, and to think that the film was well-received by critics, so I'm sure I'll be seeing it again very soon.

I'm sure this is a good film but the acting is a bit lacking and some of the scenes are ridiculous. My one criticism would be that the ending wasn't the best. - September 2, 2007What is up  Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. - August 22, 2007How can we go wrong with a good old fashioned old west movie? - August 18, 2007Gosh...This movie was really good. Good performances, great acting, great music. It's not often that I find myself agreeing with other reviewers but this movie was fun, funny, and just a blast to watch. I liked how the story was told in short scenes and not in long long scenes. My only complaint is that the movie is a little too long. You don't need to sit through a film this long and you get tired just watching the movie. I thought it was a little short, but it was still really good and a good time. - July 8, 2007what is up?  Review: This is a great old school western. Very good acting by both the star and the leading lady. The storyline was a bit predictable but I didn't mind it.

It was a great ride and I will be going back to this film whenever I get the urge. - May 26, 2007Good old western. - April 27, 2007It is really good, but don't go to the movie too early in the day. - February 2, 2006This is a pretty good movie. - January 21, 2007Great
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very good movie, and a very funny one at that. It's the story of a young girl who is trying to break into the modeling business, and ends up getting all the men in her life involved with her for no good reason. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts by establishing the fact that a couple of people are fighting over some girl and the girl starts making out with one guy. Now to be fair, that's not the most interesting part of this movie but this is where it starts to get interesting. The dude who is the guy's boss wants the guy and his wife to break up and his boss is the villain.   What I love about this movie is the way that it can be serious without being cheesy or mean or dark. It's just a story about people who have different things in their lives and sometimes they don't get along with one another and then there are the villains who want to hurt someone and do something bad and do it to someone they don the favor of. This movie has a great balance of the action with the comedy and the horror with the romance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing that was disappointing about the movie was that I was very disappointed that they didn't really bring up what happened to the woman's daughter at the end. I found it to be a bit boring, since it took so long to get there that the viewer wouldn't really care to learn the whole story.   As for the movie, it's not the best movie to come out of the past decade, but it is a great tribute to a great writer and director. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-told, well-acted, well put together movie about a great writer and a great actress: I've seen a lot of "film about writing" films (think of this as a sort of cinematic version of "The Graduate"), but this one is very different: not only does it tell the story of two writers, but it's also a film about women.   The story, which was told well and with a little bit of comedy, is told from the female perspective, which I think gives it a bit of extra power (I'm sure there is an interesting female perspective for every genre, but I was very surprised by the way the film was told).   I thought the film did a very good job with portraying the two writers as different personalities, but the real strength of the film is in the way it uses the two women as characters, which is not something that is done very often.  The two women are portrayed as flawed characters, but they have a lot to say about each other, which makes for a very interesting read.  When I finished this film, I wanted to talk about it with my friends: what a great movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was surprised with this film, I'm not a huge fan of horror movies so I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched the trailer. I was really surprised when the movie opened up. It started off with some good scary stuff, then it really got scary. There is a scene where a guy and his wife get killed and then when they wake up the husband seems to be okay, he has a bit of a wound on his arm. Then the guy gets up and walks to the bathroom where his wife is in the shower. He takes a couple of steps back before he turns and goes into the shower himself and then his wife turns around and screams and screams. It was really freaky. And I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen it a lot over the years since it first came out in 1990 and I remember when I saw it in '91 I was 14 years old and it was the first time I saw a true superhero movie that was just a real fun movie to watch. The story, action, and humor were great. I loved the villains and I thought the cast were great too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie.   The movie takes place in a small town in upstate New York.  The story starts when a local man is accused of a murder and is brought in for trial.  He's a good guy.  When I first watched this I thought that it was too obvious that there was a secret behind all of this.  But this movie was well worth watching.  It doesn't really get going until about halfway through.  That said it's never dull.  There is a great ending, and a great cliffhanger.  A movie that I will always recommend to those that have not seen it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen two other great movies made from a very poor source material, both of which are worth seeing. I'm sure this movie will get the same kind of attention. I haven't seen a movie this good and this funny since the days of Billy Wilder, and I can't think of a better movie than this one. It is the perfect mix of the good and bad; the bad not being so bad, the good being so good that it will make you laugh at yourself. What a movie! I can understand why it has been described by one critic as "a maudlin, sad film with a terrible plot and an even more terrible story to match".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fantastic sequel to the original. You may not want to have this sequel too close to your heart or you may be thinking about this film for many years to come. It is very important to remember that this is a comedy. This sequel has more serious moments but the jokes are still funny. A wonderful job by everyone involved with this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I watched the first scene of this film, I immediately became fascinated with the movie's setting and all the various situations it creates. This is no typical movie but instead a clever, witty, yet dark, movie in its own way. I found the movie interesting and very well-paced, but I was also a bit disappointed with some parts of the movie. As it says, this is a film about a man who has an urge to kill himself. He tries to deal with it by reading books about suicide and doing things to help him become better at killing himself. But, he is always unable to find the right way to kill himself. At the same time, he does not want to commit suicide. His wife is unhappy with the way he is being, and his daughter, who is a little more intelligent than him, is worried about him. So, they try to convince him to commit suicde...and so, he tries again and again to kill his self. He is forced to face the real problems he has to face in life, and he tries to find a solution. In a way, I enjoyed the movie and I think it was good to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie does its job well, even if the characterizations of the cast are weak.   I was surprised that the plot did not seem to be centered around a particular city or area.  However, the setting of the film is not that great and the ending is not surprising.  One thing I do like about the movie is that it does not try to cover a vast expanse of territory with a few characters.  For a "non-action" picture, it is actually a little slow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is awesome, and you cant go wrong with the premise! The script is solid, but the acting is not spectacular, i love how the two men talk and act as friends. I think a few scenes of dialogue could have been a bit more engaging, but they aren't the worst in the world.    And this review will be short, because we must see the movie in its entirety.  I loved this movie, and I will be looking forward to the next one.

As a boy my best memories were of watching The Three Stooges with my parents, and also of watching Charlie Brown in a bathtub, or at least the tub my mother used to make.  This was a very good movie, and I enjoyed it very much. I can't wait to see the whole film again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is just about as enjoyable as it could be, so if you are looking for a funny romp with a really cool, badass woman, then this one might be just what the doctor ordered.   The film is about a woman named Sarah, who is the daughter of a wealthy industrialist named Jack who is out of the picture because his wife is getting too old to work in his factories. Sarah is a genius, as you can see from her name. She is also a lesbian, so there are several scenes that involve her seducing men.  Sarah is forced to leave her home town, and she ends up living in a small trailer park, where she is adopted by the owner's daughter, who lives with her boyfriend, who happens to be her childhood friend.  Once Sarah begins to understand the difficulties of living alone, she decides to leave Jack and become a social worker in the small town she is working in. She becomes a social work teacher and meets two wonderful young women, and they all become the friends she never knew she had.  The movie is about all the different people in the movie, and it is also about the problems of the people who live in the town. It is also quite funny and exciting at times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a comedy this film is really clever, and it works!   The movie follows a pair of twins, Charlie and John, who have very different personalities and are forced to live together after John is sent to live with his aunt.   When John is finally allowed to go to the beach with the twins, things don't go too well, and the twins are forced into some kind of competition for John.  They are also sent to a strange island and are made to work in a circus, and do odd jobs.  It is all quite funny, but the movie does get really silly at one point.  And it all ends in a rather unpleasant way.  I didn't know I was going to like this movie as much as I did, but it is good enough that it deserves a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The thing about the future is that nothing is certain but what is certain is that we won't be here long. We'll all be working in the fields, like we used to, and our little shops will be as common as the shops that they are now."   This movie is about a small shop in the future. I found myself fascinated by the movie and even though it didn't deliver on what it promised, it made me want to go to the movie to see if that future really does exist.   I am not sure if this movie is for everyone and the movie does have a little bit of a "sci-fi" feel to it. But I think the story and characters are very relatable and are believable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An American comedy-drama about a young man from the Midwest who, on the verge of quitting college to become a rock star, becomes infatuated with a beautiful woman from New York who also wants to go to college, and a great love story is born.   I have only seen this film about two times, the second time being a night at a house party, and I was impressed.  The film has a pretty good mix of comedy and drama.  It has the elements to be a pretty great movie if only you like a good romantic comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that has a really funny and well written screenplay, and a movie about a man who has to decide what to do about his father. As one of the actors in the movie says "it's a great day for the world! It's a good day to be a dad!" The story is about a great-great-grandfather named "Jim" (the one in the shirt) who's life ends after trying to find his missing son. When his son (named "Duke" or "Duff" depending on what you read) gets his first car, he is given a ride by a kid named "Caleb", who is a great big fat guy (a true actor in every sense of the word) played by an actor named Robert Duvall (he has a great little role). Jim has his own car, but can't seem to get it working because "it won't turn!". Caleb has a little brother named "Sam" and a "wife" named "Laura". Laura is a little old lady who takes care of them all. Caleb does all the cooking, and has to take the car to the garage so they can do repairs. Sam is the big kid and takes care a little of Laura. Duke is the youngest. I enjoyed watching this movie and it has a good plot, but it's the actors that made it a great movie. The plot wasn't great, but the actors were really good and played their parts well.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a good little thriller it is quite entertaining. But at the same time the film does have a slight problem. It is very short. There are 2 films (or rather three) in one. Each movie is a slightly different tale. The story takes place in the 1930s. The main protagonist is a British Army officer. A German soldier goes on a killing spree in London. This is a good action film but it suffers a little from the lack of a plot. There is nothing that has any real meaning. It was a good story to start off the evening. It could be a great film but at the end it is a bit too short.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went in with high expectations. I had already seen a lot of good movies before this and they always did great, but this one had a little more kick than most of them. The acting was great. There was a whole lot of laughs. If I ever get the chance to watch a comedy like this again I will be sure to pick this movie up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie I saw in 2013, a really good movie. Good character and plot. The movie is about a group of friends who decide to go on a camping trip in a remote place and the adventure starts from there. The first half of the movie is really slow and boring and the second half is really interesting. I have to say that it is a very good movie with good acting and good script. This movie will stay with me for a long time and I highly recommend it to all those who like good stories.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I want to say I love this movie! I was shocked by the special effects. They were absolutely outstanding and very well done.

The movie has some good laughs and good scenes as well. I felt that it was really fun to watch this movie. My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all this film is a great little gem, with a great story and a great ending. I liked it a lot, but it could have been better!

However, it was good to see that someone did not give up, she is strong and funny at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director is a very good actor who could have been a real pro in Hollywood.   I am not saying all that he did was brilliant but it was well done. The writing of the story was good enough to give a feel of the movie as a whole, I think, and there were enough jokes in the story to keep the movie lively.  I would not have done the movie, as I said I had read many good reviews, but I would have done it more than once if it was given the chance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An incredible, heartfelt movie and a must watch for all who care about nature and its beautiful inhabitants.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't even know where to begin with this one. It started with an odd, yet strangely satisfying scene of the couple going for a walk in a forest with a group of people, and being followed by a man in a car. I think that's a pretty big statement to make about a movie, but it's also pretty silly. But that doesn't stop them from enjoying it. After a few minutes of that, we're taken into a very well-done parody of old British horror flicks, with a good amount of slapstick. There's a great deal of humour, a bit of heart, and a nice mix of the two. But what really made it unique was the performance from Stephen Fry, who had a wonderful time doing a number of his classic impressions. In one particularly funny scene, he had the two old women go up to a door on their porch, where they were to see "the next fright film" from the late 70s. Fry takes them into the house, where all the furniture is made of green cheese, and the TV is on a continuous loop. He gets a lot of laughs out of it, and I've never seen a more enjoyable movie. The second half of the film has it pretty much intact, except the story seems to have been dropped after the original director was fired. But it's still a funny and entertaining movie. This isn't one to miss, especially for a date night with a stranger.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all of our friends we were disappointed that the movie was actually better than expected and that its sequel was even worse, but the movie's originality and original plot is quite funny!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I have a bit of a problem with this movie. First off, it was written by a man with a very poor grasp of english grammar.  The dialogue is very cheesy and I felt like I was in a high school movie at times.  And the movie had some very odd things about it like some characters are inanimate, etc.  But, what the movie is about is pretty good and I liked the movie because there was a lot of mystery to the plot.  This movie was pretty fast paced and I think it would be a great movie for a quick watch,  but the ending did not really satisfy me as the movie started with a strange ending that I couldn't understand at all.  So this is one of those movies you don't really enjoy when watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story starts with a rather cliche romance story about a man and a woman who are in love and trying to raise their child in an isolated, rural, isolated little town.  This is something I really liked about the movie.   There was something about this story that I just felt was a lot more realistic than other movie's about couples with kids and stuff like that.  In the middle of the movie we see a little girl who is about 5 years old.  We see her go on a journey with her father.  They go to an abandoned house and see a bunch of skeletons.  She sees a giant skeleton that says, "Here's a little surprise for you"  She goes to her daddy who is holding her.  He goes and tells her to go into the water.  The little girl goes in and drowns.  As the father tries to save her and the other skeletons with the help of a girl named Molly, the other little girls get sick and one of them gets killed.  When the little girl gets back to her dad he tells her that the town has been poisoned and now there's nothing they can do to save themselves.  This movie was actually very realistic about how the little girls lived.  I did not understand it as a child but I think that I understand it now.  It's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone looking to watch a simple movie about a couple and their children. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing I hate about this movie is that it doesn't have any romance in it!   I really like the movie because it has the action and there's nothing wrong with the plot, however, there is no romance in this movie.   For a romance movie it has very little drama.    This movie isn't bad, in fact it is a good romantic comedy!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is about a young boy named Max (Mackenzie Foy) who dreams of becoming a millionaire. He learns a little bit about the world and what it has to offer, especially the beautiful and colorful town of New York. But when he moves to New York he discovers that his life isn't all roses and rainbows. There is a group of kids who hate him and his new found wealth. He has to find out why they hate him.   It has a great story line with interesting characters, including a character named Max the young guy who seems like a nice guy. It was so strange to see a film set in the mid 80's and to have a character who was young and a rich kid at the time.  There were times when I felt the same kind of hatred towards Max as I was feeling towards my own parents. I felt that they had taken my money and done nothing with it. The movie starts out great and it really feels like a good fun ride. Then there was this little scene where there is a girl who has just gotten off a train. We do not see her face, but we do hear a female voice. And that voice is the female voice of my mother. I found it very disturbing. I do not know why she does this but when she does it I do feel a little sick to my stomach.  Another scene in this movie where a guy who is named George (Richard Dreyfuss) is having a discussion with a lady and this guy does not like him at all. The guy does what I feel all men do. He makes some stupid remarks about girls and how they should not be so promiscuous and he says that George should be ashamed of himself and get a job.  Finally there is an interesting scene about a girl named Rosemary who has been working as a secretary and she is being offered a job as a stripper in the brothel in New York because the owner has recently hired a new girl.  I would say that the movie is about the first and second quarter of the 1970's and it is very true to life.  This movie is fun and the special effects are very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a nice little movie with a simple premise: there's a small town with a small army of superpowered warriors, who go on a battle of wits against the army of evil that dwells in a large city. As with most super heroes movies, the actors are fantastic and the action is great. Unfortunately, I feel the story didn't go as well as it could have, and that is with the hero of the film, and not the villain. The big problem is that the movie doesn't go beyond what the writer initially planned, which is a little dull. The rest of the cast and the plot are pretty good, with a good ending at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good, but not spectacular movie. It's more of a low-budget Hollywood action movie, than a real good, original movie.   While the movie plays out as a typical Hollywood action film, I never saw this movie really take off, as a real action movie. That's just it.    This movie is just another Hollywood action flick, you know what I mean.  In fact, it's more a low budget action flick than anything else.  The acting is the worst of the movie and I hated it all.  This movie was written and directed by David Gordon Green, who also wrote and directed the "Superman Returns" and the "Sleeper." I have a feeling he would have done well in "Supermarket".   I think "Shane" is a terrible, terrible movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never watched a movie so much like a science-fiction film as I did in this one. The fact that this film is made by a very good director is quite the achievement. He knows what he is doing in a very imaginative way. For this he must be credited to the wonderful actress. And the story itself is very entertaining and will make you say WOW. This is a perfect example of how to make a good sci-fi movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've had the great fortune of seeing The Wolfman, the sequel to The Wolf Man, two years ago and I found myself in awe and in love with the new film. The Wolf is an interesting character and I don't know how many times I will see this man, but I hope he never stops playing the fool! This was a fun movie for the young and old, and I hope we see the last of the Wolfman.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was on a mission to see the movie of The Amazing Spider-Man.  I am not sure if this is a movie I should have seen.    I can't say for sure as there is a whole bunch of different parts.  For a film this size, I expected a lot from this picture.  The sets are great, but it is lacking in detail and details.  Peter and the webslinger get separated during the chase.  It is a good thing that they are separated in the middle of the chase because then the action is really good.  These are both good guys and they have a pretty good chase going.  There are some nice set pieces and action in this film.  This movie was a little strange for me.  When a villain, the Green Goblin gets his hands on a new costume (like the one we've all seen in a spiderman comic), he changes into this new one.  No one looks like they have had this costume on their entire lives.  After the first act, I was like, "whoa."  As if the costumes were not enough, the Goblin then changes his name to Norman Osborn (or so he thinks).  The Green Goblin's evil ways become more and more evident as this film continues.  In this film, we see the Green Goblin in a little girl's clothing.  A great set.  One thing I really liked was the way it was edited.  Everything moves from left to right.  As you watch this movie, your heart will be in your throat.  It was a good ride.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second movie is quite good. It's a story about a guy who finds a large animal and decides to take it home and care for it. It was very well made. I liked how the characters were more like in real life rather than cartoon characters. You can tell that the guy takes this giant thing home in the car and it's a great car. I like the ending, which I'm not sure if anyone could get past.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a movie! I did not see this movie at a theater because of the cost of it (although, it should be in the theaters anyway). It is available on DVD in my neighborhood, and I am very pleased with it. It is a great movie for the whole family to see together. I recommend this movie to all who are willing to take the time to watch it and learn a little about the people and their stories. It was wonderful to watch and I enjoyed it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A simple story of a girl and a boy who get lost, they start walking along a highway and end up in a desert, the girl gets killed by a car, and after dying she is found a day later by a boy named Willard who is driving a truck full of supplies, and the girl is now walking towards him.   This is a movie that you could probably watch once and forget about it and then watch it again and again and maybe you will remember it someday, if you have never seen it you have got to watch it, and you have GOT to see it again!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In terms of humor, the movie is very, very good, and one of the best comedy movies I've seen all year.   The movie is a parody of an "average family movie", but really gets more funny the more you think about it, until the movie's ending.  The only thing I would have done differently is if it would have been possible to see the movie again after watching it a few times in the theater.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The thing about these movies are that they always seemed to be a lot funnier and smarter when I was a kid.   And I liked this movie because of the fact that it was about a little boy and his dog!    So, I was very glad to hear they were going to be making a film of this movie.  I was also happy to hear there will be a sequel.

I think that all those people in this movie should feel good about themselves. That's what I think, the movie was funny. It would definitely make you laugh and I recommend it for all ages.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a pretty good movie.   And to be fair, it was really cool to see a movie that didn't have a female lead, even though that was a big part of the appeal.  There was an all-male cast, but the all-boys' antics were very funny.  When the guys decided to make a movie, they were all in costume, just so we could see the guys, but when they started their movie, the entire cast had to sit in blackface.  I don't know what the movie was about, but it was fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie I watched with the movie theater being in a new building. I walked in with an anticipation that made me excited to see this movie, and boy, did it live up to my expectations. The movie had an action packed plot, which I love to see. It didn't take me too long to figure out what was going on in this movie. I was very happy to see it.   I don't really want to spoil anything that happened in the movie, but I will tell you how I felt towards the end of the movie.  I liked the action, but didn't really like the story at the same time. I liked how they made me feel as if the characters could have had a family, but they didn't want one. It's like they had to go back to the good ol' days and put on a show to make the kids think that they could still live with their father.  A big issue that I have with this movie is the way they cut out scenes. I have to say, even though I liked some of the scenes that they had me enjoy, I didn't like seeing all of the characters that were in the theater.  It would have made the movie go a lot smoother if they would have cut out all of these scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, the movie starts with a great prologue - in which you can see the character's family and all the interesting places they lived. Then, we have a pretty typical movie set-up: a guy meets a girl at a concert, they get along well and the scene ends with him asking her to marry him (she refuses - it's a stupid movie). The story is really predictable and nothing surprising happens. In the end, the girl's brother is killed by a gang of teenagers who are jealous of the fact that he's a real nice guy and didn't marry a pretty girl. They break his heart and take his girl to their home, where the family lives: there's a great deal of alcohol, a big kitchen with a refrigerator (not exactly a fridge) and lots of things to eat, and a good time is had by all.   In short, I enjoyed this movie because it was entertaining, and not boring, although I didn't get very far in the plot. The character of the brother was very simple but interesting and made the movie enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love a movie about people who can do things they shouldn't be able to do.   The story is pretty simple: a young girl tries to go out on a date by herself, and when the guys try to take advantage of her, things get a little too crazy.  It's really fun, especially if you like a good chase scene.

A few good special effects and a funny ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this movie was pretty cool. It was a movie about a guy who has a "super power" called "The Power", a sort of supernatural energy that allows him to make anything look normal. He's a little eccentric, has a little thing about having to do things the right way, and even though he's a complete jerk he's good at what he does. He uses his super power to solve all his problems. He also makes the city a beautiful place to live and his girlfriend (the hot one) is always there to remind him to "live life". His friends are mostly weird people and he has an odd sense of humor. The movie was very "out there" and interesting, and it had a lot of action scenes. I'm really not a huge fan of "superpowers" like this, I just didn't like this movie. It didn't have a huge punch to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little worried about this movie when I saw the trailer, but I'm glad that I went in with open mind.   The movie opens up with the story of a man named Bill who has a strange connection with his deceased son. After a short movie about their adventures in the park, the movie then shifts into a flashback of Bill's son.  The boy and his friends are looking for his father and are chased down by Bill who thinks they stole some items from the park.  As the boys run through the woods one of them ends up falling through a tree.  He gets up and runs but finds his feet stuck.  It is then that a mysterious woman named Mrs. Bowers appears and tells Bill to put the boy down.  When Bill gets down, he finds that the boy is no longer alive.  So, Bill decides to try and help the boys find their father again.  There are a few funny moments in this movie, which was a nice change from the rest of the horror movies we see nowadays.  I really enjoyed this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie opens with a black and white picture of a young woman, sitting in a car on the side of the road, looking distressed and frightened. The black and whites are the words of a lady who has been taken from her family, and who is waiting for her boyfriend to get back. She has a message to give him, but is unable to talk to him for fear of his being taken away with them. She is given food and drink by her boyfriend.  The next morning, the same man returns, asking to talk more about her. The next day he comes back, not in a good mood and asking to see her again. She tells him about the message she gave him, and how it was a message that would never be answered, and when he leaves she sees a man, looking like a priest, with the words "S.S.H.A.D." (St. James Hospital and Asylum for the Insane) on a wall. After they are gone the film continues.      The following scenes have the usual "one-up" and "one down" situation. A young man arrives at St. James, and meets his old lady friend. She gets in a strange car with an Irishman, but they stop and she asks what is he doing out here. They get into the car, and she gets out and goes to her car, but he is gone. He shows up again a few days later, but she doesn't remember him. When she is taken to the hospital she goes through several more doctors, before a priest arrives. He seems friendly, and tries to convince her that her husband is just a sick old man and she shouldn't be upset. However, she gets even more depressed and refuses to go back to him. The priest tries to help her, and takes her out into a field, and has a conversation with a very old man. The old man is really a priest and seems to know more about the young woman's life than anyone. But, then the old man reveals that the young man is an alien from a star system called Cervantes, and that the alien had taken over the world and made her the woman she is now. He tells her that there was a little girl who had been brought to Cervante from the planet Pallas, and he would take her back. The alien wanted to make his people believe that he was the messiah and they would serve him in

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said, I went in expecting this movie to be a straight up action movie. The plot was alright, but nothing to get really excited about. I liked the action and some of the characters.   It did have some good action and I was not disappointed.  The movie was a big hit in Germany for several weeks when it came out and the American release was not as successful.  So, this movie had a good run in Europe but is not the success it was supposed to be in America.  A must see for fans of action and the James Bond franchise, but not for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You're in an elevator. The elevator is filled with white people who don't speak. But at least they're not all dead. The door opens and a bald, fat, elderly man steps out. He turns to you, nods and walks away. You walk out of that elevator and go to a different elevator, which you find empty. Then the other elevator opens. But this is empty too. You go to another elevator but there are no people. Then you take a call and it goes to voicemail. You listen to the voicemail but it goes no further. Finally you walk out into a snow storm and end up walking through a field of dead people. You have an odd feeling about it and you go back to the other empty elevator, but you're not sure if it's empty. You find a woman there, but she doesn't know you. Maybe she's dead."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a group of people (men and women) who have been caught robbing a bank, but are now released. There is a robbery at the police station and one of the men (Culkin's character) is arrested. He has been found with a gun in his hand and the woman who found him also is taken into the police cell. When the woman's husband (Buchanan's character), a detective, arrives and starts questioning the other man, the robbers escape. The next morning the husband and his wife find that they have lost both their husbands and a son in the robbery. They decide to look for a new place to live and they go looking for a home. The home is a two story house that was made by a man who is a "hippie" and that he lived in a shack until a house fire destroyed the shack and he moved into a small cottage. The family lives in the house and there is a young child who goes to a nearby school. There are two children: the boy is only eight years old and is not as bright as his father. The young man is not quite as clever as his mother and is also not as good as his brother. The boys go to school and one day one of them (the boy) brings a piece of candy to a classmate who asks the boy to buy something for him (because the kid is hungry). The boy gives the boy a piece and the boy goes to the teacher and says, "Why don't you buy me a little something to eat?" The teacher asks, "What for?" and the young man responds, "I don't know. You have a little and I have nothing." The teacher laughs and says "I'll give you something to taste, you have a piece." The young boy brings the piece of food to the classmate and asks, and he tells the boy that he wants something to drink. The boy takes the piece and gives it to the boy, but when he gets up to get the chocolate that has been offered to him by the classmate he realizes that there is nothing but the candy and his own candy and the classmate has a bottle of water. He picks up the bottle and looks to see what it is and when he does he realizes it is water. The classmate says, the "water" is water but it is not the water he had been drinking and the water is only water and his friend (the boys) will never find him again.

And with a cast that includes such a wide range of talents, from the well known and well-respected (like the late, great Jerry Orbach) to the unknown, it's always interesting to see what they do with the material and give you a bit of an idea of what's really going on in the lives of these characters.

The movie was about two men who work in a restaurant called "Lucky Man's", they get caught in the middle of a battle between a gang of young men and a corrupt police chief. The two policemen are playing out a fantasy scenario that involves a man and a horse and a woman riding a dragon and a boy fighting a bear.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie's plot:    The hero is a boy named Johnny Smith, who is the son of a famous scientist (played by James Brolin) and a pretty beautiful girl (played with a good sense of humor by Susan Sarandon).    When Johnny is 8 years old, he accidentally shoots himself in the eye with a pellet gun, resulting in a total loss of vision and hearing in both eyes.   Once he is blind, Johnny can only see by hearing and can only hear by thinking.  Johnny is a poor student and is forced to work a part time job to pay his bills.  He is a bit of a loner who likes to think of himself as a detective in an imaginary world.  Unfortunately, he is the target of the local bully (played very well by Will Ferrell), who is a bully for the entire school.  When his parents discover his blindness, they both go out and buy Johnny a new pair of glasses, with the help of the school teacher (played beautifully by Michelle Williams) and the school doctor (played brilliantly by Bill Murray).  Johnny's sight and hearing returns, but not for long.  The rest of the film follows Johnny's life with his new friends, a girl named Alice (played superbly by Gwyneth Paltrow) and her husband Charlie (Robert Redford).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, if you don't like horror films, you might not like this one. You're supposed to be scared of clowns, and yet somehow, you end up with a good amount of them in your belly.   The story is quite good in the first half.  It takes a while for us to find out who we are, where we are and what the hell happened to our old man. It's funny how many of the scenes were cut out of the original movie, but the good bits of it make up for it.  After we meet the new guy, we are introduced to the new neighbor.  He's an old clown who has a lot of trouble with the law, and he's a bit... off... as the story progresses.  But it's all very well done.  A lot of people were concerned that this was going to be a campy horror film.  I think the cast did an awesome job at giving a clown character a bit more depth.  The ending was kind of disappointing.  Yes, the new kid is great, and it does have a sort of happy ending, but I'm a little sad about how the story ends.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "If I had my way, I would love to be an astronaut" is what the characters say in their final scene.     It's a little bit "The Exorcist" with a spaceship, but in an old Star Trek setting.  The movie is set in the 24th century, with a lot of space battles, strange experiments with life-forms (some of which will be familiar to Star Trek fans), and a lot to say about a whole bunch of issues (alien race, racism, sexism, etc.)   There are many elements in this movie that are pretty typical.  Some of the elements are well thought out (like the whole alien race being different from humanoids, and the crew being very different from each other)   The acting is good.  If you like Star Trek, you might like this movie.  This was my second choice for the best sci-fi movie of all time.  It's one of the best action movies ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A big, bold and brilliant film.   Directed by the great Stephen Frears - with a wonderful script by Jonathan Lynn.  The entire film is one huge set piece.  I love big set pieces.  There are a lot of things going on in this film - which are of course just a part of the film's bigger story - but they all add up to a very impressive and brilliant set piece!  I have said this before about Stephen Frear's films - that they're one of the great mysteries of modern film making.  Here it is in one big cinematic package - it's a great big big movie - full of action, sex, nudity, adventure and good ol' fashioned adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went in for a screening of this movie with a friend (I'm so glad he showed up because he knew the entire plot line and gave a stellar performance). The whole plot is very reminiscent of the movie, especially the ending. This is a must see movie. The movie itself is like a little story told with the film. The story is set in a future where the world is ruined by environmental pollution caused by mankind's lust for wealth, and one lone man (Boyd) who is a mechanic, takes charge of a small but growing group of survivors. There is no other people, so he and his friends must do their best to survive (this isn't the only time the world will be like this) but as is the way of these things the world seems to be falling apart. I thought the movie was interesting enough to see for myself but I think it would be better if you go out to see the movie with others as this will help you follow along more easily. There are some laughs here and there, but they are brief and not very funny. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good tale.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a classic horror movie that you will see again and again.   As a horror movie it is good for kids to watch with scary sounds in a dark house.  I loved it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot is a bit cliche, but it was never bad.   This is the only movie that I saw this year that didn't try to tell a tale of a lost princess, but instead focused on a father and son's friendship. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 10 minutes were so bad, they even had to add music. But when they got it right, it was brilliant! When this movie is over, I think that I am going to have a whole new respect for this film.   - March 5, 2012Great
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is quite enjoyable. I think it's a bit unfair when they say it's not a "franchise" because it's really about the team of players, and the coach and his family, and their journey in a new country.   This is the first time a Canadian hockey player has been in the Olympic finals since the 1972 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Thing", directed by Joe Dante and co-starring a truly outstanding ensemble cast of young actors, is a wonderful example of a movie that is made by people who want to do a good job and not get too obsessed with the effects.   In fact, it's a good enough movie to make you feel like a kid again, because there's nothing quite like it.  A group of young boys, who can only survive because of the Thing's ability to control the weather, meet up in a deserted town, where they find a beautiful woman with an unfortunate name (the woman's name is not mentioned in the film).   When the Thing shows up, he has a problem, which is that he doesn't understand how the weather works.  His solution is to eat a whole car full of watermelons, then shoot it up, making the car sink into the ground and then shoot up a second car, destroying the car and its occupants.  The Thing then escapes into the woods, where he is attacked by a large bear.  He uses a shotgun to shoot at the bear, who bites him and then eats him.  With the help of some friends, the boys try to escape, but there are lots of obstacles in their way, from falling logs to the Thing itself.  It's very hard to make this movie look good, because the effects are so amazingly good.  "The Thing" is very enjoyable, and the performances are all quite wonderful, especially Joe Dante, who seems to be having the time of his life as he tries to get the film's message across.  One of the best movies of the year.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "real" reason for a new director's name appearing on a big budget film.  .   As for the script, there's a very strange plot that features a gang of homeless kids living in a car.  A strange thing about it is, there are no people in the film, nor is there any dialogue that's a "dialogue".   A young girl goes to the "wonderful" town, but the only thing that can make her happy is to go to a "great" restaurant where there is a "very nice" waiter.  In the film there is no sign of the characters, and there are hardly any words spoken!  The kids seem to have a very "realistic" outlook, and are really trying to make a living by stealing cars.  But there's something about this story that really does get to the viewer.  There's something "terrifying" about watching people being treated very "humanely", while those in authority make all sorts of mistakes in their management.  This may be an anti-social film, but it definitely gets under your skin.  The cast really brings it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed The Wolf of Wall Street   a lot. It's an entertaining film that tells the story of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who loses everything in a major scandal in the late 1970's. He has to deal with the people who did this, and who he did this to, in the hopes of being able to get it back on track. It was a very well made film with lots of good jokes, which really made it a lot of fun.   There were some interesting characters that came across well, especially Nick Nolte. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll always remember this movie as a big laugh-out-loud-couch-comedy of sorts that's full of laughs and good times, and if you can get your mitts on it at any price, then you can't really go wrong.   When you first see this film it is a simple story of two buddies on the eve of a major payday they're going to get for their company by working for a small business owner named Mr. Black (William Powell).   But as the film progresses you soon realize that the guys are not quite like the rest of Mr.Black's employees.  As the film ends the three guys are now working for the old man himself, and after a long day of working hard, they end up getting paid quite a big sum of money.  Once again it's the comedy we are given that really keeps the film from being a boring affair, and of course there is plenty of slapstick as we witness all the shenanigans this guy Black has going on.  There isn't much dialogue in the film, as most of the humor is in the slapstick and off-color jokes and it's all presented fairly nicely.  When it all comes down to it, though, I think it was the chemistry of these two characters and the chemistry between them that really brought the film to life for me.  It was a pretty funny film and for those who enjoy a little bit of slap-stick and a lot of humor, this is a film you should check out at the very least.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched "The Matrix" about a dozen times. It was like the original film, but it had a better plot and better acting by Keanu Reaves.   The plot is set in a future of war, but also of peace. In a future that is being destroyed, it is a struggle to preserve human consciousness. A woman named Trinity has a machine which allows her to see into the future and she can tell the future when she has sex with a man named Johnny. Johnny decides to have a sex with her when he finds a woman he likes in her house, which is not too far away from hers. But Trinity is not quite what she seems. Her body changes into that of a young girl, so she can have sex with Johnny. He tries to keep his emotions in check and Trinity decides that he is her new body. They get together and Trinity becomes a very sexy woman who goes about in a hot little bikini. It's a pretty bad movie, but a little better than many other films in the "Matrix" franchise. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film about a group of men who, for various reasons, live together in a house on a quiet suburban street. This is a movie about friendship and love, life and the way the world works. For my money, it's a good film about good guys that don't get too screwed over by the world, which is always looking for someone to destroy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title, The New World, is what makes this one.   It is a future where technology has taken over so much of human affairs. The "new world" is divided into six spheres.  One, called, The Core, is home to most of the population.  There, they live together in a kind of urban, "new" way, and there are many government-sponsored activities.  The people of the Core live in a fairly close-knit community.  They do whatever they have to, and their lives are as predictable as they are dull.  On the other six spheres, there are people who live in cities, and other people who go to their rural villages.  In the rural villages, there is a mixture of agriculture, fishing, and cattle raising.  Here, the people who are called, "the Other" live a lot more naturally.  At first glance, these people seem to be, in a sense, superior to the people living in the Core.  This superiority is not the result of any superior nature.  All of the Other people have a common language, a common way of life, a similar culture, and a similar relationship with nature. The only difference between the Two is that the Other lives in a very, very small area (1-4 acres, usually) of the city and, therefore, doesn't need a large number of people to live in peace.  These Other people seem, to a certain degree, to understand humans. They are very peaceful and, at first glance at least, have a way of living which we have not yet been able to fully understand.  And they are a part of our human society, yet they have almost no contact with humans.  I think that if we were to put a group of our best students together in the city where they live, and let them have free run of the place for a while, we would probably be able to understand the people and learn to respect their way of thinking.  But that isn't the kind of place we are looking at today.  Now, let's move on to a brief discussion of the plot.  (Note: The plot and characters of the film are very much based upon the book, The Day the Earth Stood Still by Carl Sagan.)  In a way, The Future is a "what-if".  We haven't been able yet to fully appreciate what it is like to live on other planets
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Good:  * Good acting, some good acting   * Some good humor and action.   This film has a lot of humor.  One of the best scenes  is with one of the characters.  * Interesting plot with some surprises in store for the audience.  The Bad:  - The director of this film, a friend of mine, is a real hick.  So why would a film like this be released on video?  I have to wonder, is this a joke?  * The "Cockfight" scene  is the most boring and pointless part of the movie.  It should have been filmed on a horse farm!  * There are several unnecessary scenes.  And the actors do not appear to be enjoying themselves.  Overall, if you like action and action scenes...this movie will do the trick for you.  I will give this a 2 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most memorable scene in the film is the scene in which Tom Cruise has the opportunity to kill a bunch of enemies who try to kill him.   I have seen Tom Cruise in various action films and this movie is an improvement.  It does have a similar story to Die Hard.  This movie would be better with a female lead as they did not do much with her.  This has a good ending but it was not enough for a movie of this type.  I would not recommend this film to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie a lot! This is probably the most serious and dark story I have ever seen in a movie. The characters are all extremely well done. I felt that everything in this movie was completely realistic, from the characters, the scenery, even the blood that was shown, I felt all of it was done in a very realistic and accurate way, as if it were happening in the real world.   The movie is told from the point of view of Mr. Hester. Mr.Hester was a man with a bad reputation, he was a car thief, who was only wanted by the police for stealing a car.  The car is a very rare and unique car that was a gift from his girlfriend. Mr Hester steals it. He goes to a local restaurant where the owner gives him a free meal. He asks the manager where he can steal the car. The manager goes to the garage where his car is parked. He gets the keys and runs back into the restaurant where he gives the car to a man who has also been asked to steal the cars. When the car is stolen, Mr Hesters life is ruined.  Mr Hers life is not over, he has a young son who he has never met, and a wife.  When the husband goes to Mr Hess and his young son, he finds out his wife has a secret that she refuses to reveal, which is about the car and her being in a relationship with Mr. Caravaggio. She wants Mr.Caravaggi to make a painting of her, which was a present from Mr. caravaggianie.  What Mr Henners son does not know is his mom was killed and his dad buried her in a remote part of the cemetery. He is angry and is determined to find out the truth.  After the death of his mother, his son is afraid of his father. His father does not want his son to have any more problems with his father and wants him to stay away from him.  The movie takes place from 1792 to the present day and is a real mystery.  You see the car stolen from the restaurant, the car being driven by a very evil character that will not hesitate to kill if anyone gets in his way.  One of the main characters that makes this movie so special is Mr. Gacy.  This man was a serial killer who murdered many young and old, young kids and adults.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a classic movie about a boy and a girl, about their lives and the people that are living in the neighborhood. You can see the differences in their styles: the girl is pretty, smart and knows how to get in with the boys, the boy doesn't seem to care much for women or anything (I'm pretty sure the movie never made him really like a girl), and in the end he takes her away from the guy that makes her cry. The movie is about the kids growing up. The parents are there to keep a straight face and the kids keep trying to figure out their lives. This movie is a great love story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen all the movies in this series and I have to say that this is by far the best.   The story is well thought out and the action is good and real.  But there are some problems like the actors have a big lead roles in the action.  They don't make the audience feel like they are part of the action but rather just look good.  This movie also has a lot of blood, but you do not see the body parts all over the place.  I guess I will see the second movie with the characters that look more like me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is one of those movies that I cannot stop watching and I am not sure how I will ever get it all in one go (I watched it twice this weekend). It is a very good movie from the perspective of a young woman who just got a job as a secretary at a small newspaper. She is hired as the new girl, and the first job she has is to do the same thing her brother used to do: clean the rooms. She's rather good at it but ends up in trouble.   In a nice twist of fate, she ends up being hired as a reporter in a major newspaper. At this newspaper her job consists of coming to all the local news stations and recording stories (usually of crimes).   She doesn't like reporting at all and feels as though she is wasting her time.  A young man comes to her office one day to talk about some things he's been up to. He brings along a girl who is in his class. He is a student at a local university.  This is how my friends and I first found out about this movie!  It was in our public library.  It had been on TV the night before.  We just couldn't get enough of it. We stayed up the entire night, and we watched it all over again the next day. It really is a great movie. The plot is very simple, but it is a well done one.  I can't help but be reminded of an old story I saw on the PBS show, "Greenside."   I am looking forward to the movie coming out on DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am enjoying this movie. It has a very strong plot, and it's a very good plot with great acting and great scenes. It is a comedy, but it isn't a bad comedy. It's a good comedy, and the laughs are good, though not great. The movie is a good film, and I think it was made for TV, but I think the best version of it is in a theater.   This movie made a big impression on me when I saw it.  The best thing about this movie is the music.  It's like nothing you've seen before, but at the same time it's like an old movie you remember from the 50s.  I like it. The cast is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So far as good movies go, I'm loving this one. The writing is very good, the cast is really talented and the plot is really interesting. The best part is the "fate of the film is decided with an old woman." She knows all the things which are going to happen in this film and what the consequences are, and I really enjoyed this part because it really made me question if she really knew what she was talking about.   The acting is really good and so is the direction. The characters are also really well acted. The film has a good amount of sex scenes which makes up for its lack of story and plot. It's also good that the film doesn't feel like it's just going through the motions.   Rated:

I'm in a body bag with a bullet hole in my chest. What's more is that my wife is gone, but a little girl from our farm is alive and well. I ask my doctor about my family. She tells me my wife and I are still there. We are in a new town called Fort Knox. It is full of people who don't have a home. And it seems like everyone is out to get me. I've made my bed and now I must lie in it. I have only one thing left to do, and that is to find a good wife who can protect me."   "The first thing we do, it's like a train wreck. We have to have a couple of girls come to see me. We go to see this woman who is going to be my wife. And then, the next thing, I have this weird dream. This is like a nightmare, I'm like a puppet walking through the woods, or something. And this weird white guy is chasing me and I don't know what to do."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a fun romp about a group of friends getting into the water at the beach, a little more water than a summer's day. They all swim a little too close to the shore and it is just a little difficult to keep the two boys from coming up with a prank that is funny enough.   It's not too bad but it's just a good fun flick to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Road Warrior" is one of the greatest Westerns ever made. I've watched it several times and I still like it better than most of the other films on this list. For some reason, it is one that never seems to lose its grip on me. I like it because of the characters. The three main characters are all terrific. The other two are very good but not as good as the main trio. The story follows a very strong plot which is interesting and well done. There is an interesting twist at the end that is also well done, although I like to think that the twist was planned well in advance.   For a Western, this film is excellent. I'm not sure what makes this film so good. Maybe I just like the sound of it. It is definitely a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's like a dream! It's not perfect, but it's great!    The story is a mix of some good ideas (and the plot, which is a nightmare), some bad ideas (but that's a good thing), some good acting, and some bad acting.   As I said, it's not as good as The Sixth Sense.  A very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This film is very similar to "Black Swan" and both are fantastic movies. This movie is a good film and very enjoyable to watch. The plot is like a cross between "Black Mirror" and "American Hustle" in that the world is in a constant state of chaos. The movie is very good and funny with a good script, great acting and the most excellent special effects ever. I will definitely watch this movie over and over again and I recommend it highly to any person who loves a good thriller.  Helpful great and very funny with great actors and an excellent script.

His family is all together and he has made the best friends there ever were. Then the guy comes back to life. The town is a mess and a complete mess. A group of teens decides to set up a game show for the dead guy's parents. They don't get very far and the town falls apart. The movie has a really good ending. The main guy's story is one to tell.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie   "A good thriller from director Kevin R. McMurtry, which is based on the true story of an escaped convicted murderer whose life was ruined in prison." I was so impressed with how this movie was handled.   First I'm not sure what I was expecting, but when I first watched this film, I thought I was watching a different type of movie.  The story was well done, but it was set up a bit cliche for me.  But I did enjoy it!   It's an easy watch and has a bit of a twisted story, but I was laughing a lot.  My only complaint is that there were a few times I was really confused about the events in the movie. Also, I liked the movie a lot, but didn't love it.  I can see why this is a cult movie, because it has it all, from good acting to a well done story.

I would say that a good watch for everyone who likes a good comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really happy I went to this film festival. Not only did I enjoy the film, I learned so much and was happy to see so many new artists.   I think this film should be considered a milestone in film history, because it was one of the very few that managed to get into mainstream Hollywood without being a mainstream film: in the late 1950s it was common for independent films to make a lot of money, but there were also a number of films made with a very small budget that managed get into the mainstream, and even the most successful were often only modest successes, so a very high level of skill was required to make such a film and the technical side of filmmaking was highly specialized. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Mannix" is a fine little drama with a lot of emotion and a lot to give a great lead actor such as Kevin Spacey to play a character such as this. The performances are really good all around, especially Spacey's. I really liked the characters in the film and I liked the way the film was shot. The film is a little short so don't get all caught up in the ending, it does not feel very well made or acted.    I'm a fan of space movies but not of this type so I didn't find this to be an interesting space film, however it certainly made me think.

It's one of my favorite films in the 1980's, and I think it is well worth seeing. I found it hard to give it a 10, but it is so well done that it is impossible to really rate it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was little my dad gave me a copy of the novel  of the same name by Harlan Ellison. I loved it. I still do.   The film is directed by Brian De Palma and stars Anthony Perkins as Howard, the most respected man in a town of eccentric men and women. The people of his town have no respect for him, they treat him like dirt, but it's an old town. Howard is a nice guy with a secret, he's been with a woman for years and she's been faithful to him, but she's also a little crazy. She loves his money and her own life, but her life is full of violence. It's a story of a man's attempt to maintain a semblance of normalcy in a world full of madness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't find this movie to be bad at all, but I found it to be extremely overrated. This is an 80s era "horror" movie that is mostly about a girl, and her dog. The dog is portrayed as a very cool and mysterious character. This movie is not scary at all and is not a very funny movie at all. The movie is filled with "weird" effects that happen in this movie that are rather silly. The girl gets abducted in a swamp and is raped by a man in a purple robe. The guy is very "creepy" and the girl is "worried".   The movie itself is a bit hard to get into. There are a few "cliffhangers" that really don't make much sense, but nothing is really bad about this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to think that a good film can have any number of good things about it.   A few years ago I read the novel by Thomas Harris, and it changed my life.  This is what a good horror film looks like.  It is dark and scary and bloody and well done.  The writing is good and the characters are realistic.  I would like to see more movies like this because I am interested in seeing what a person like Jack Torrance goes through in a place like Hell.  If you want a movie to make you scream like a pig and want to go for a drive with your friends and just scream then get a copy and watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was initially hesitant to watch this film because of its controversial title.  It seems to make more sense to me now, especially when I realize that it was released before the "Tinseltown" films of the '60s.  There are a lot of similarities in this film to the works of director Paul Thomas Anderson.  Even if you haven't seen this movie, there are similarities with his "Boogie Nights."  A lot of great actors in this movie.  If you like a great cast playing great roles, this is a good pick for you.  Overall, it is a pretty good flick.   Recommended!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie   A couple of things I really like about this movie: 1: The script is a little silly, but the movie is funny. 2: It's about a family that travels through time, so the comedy can't be anything but funny. 3: There's a good amount of violence, and the movie gives us plenty of great car chases.   It's a bit overrated, but it's also fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did a movie watching binge this summer, and I'm glad I did.   This movie has got everything.  It's a movie about a guy who gets hit in the head by a car and now he has to learn to walk again.  His story is very interesting.  I wish I could find a copy of this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The film is funny and entertaining and shows off some very talented actors such as Tom Hanks and John Cusack. It's a good film and should be seen by everyone who has an interest in history, film or otherwise.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The action is well paced and very fast paced, even when they go to a high class penthouse apartment where they go hunting for the thief.   And at one point there's a gunfight in the penthouse that looks like a real gunfight.  A very well acted movie that has a very nice ending, and even though there's no cliffhanger and no need to see who lives and who dies, it's not a bad movie and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about a man who has spent his whole life in a place where everyone is afraid of a large group of strange, giant spiders. One day, while walking along a road, the man comes across an old woman. The man is terrified and goes to stay with her for the night. The woman, however, is not a monster. It's an old man who doesn't seem to want to leave.   What I liked:  A great monster movie with some good effects, which is hard to find in a movie these days.  I think a lot of the scares come from the character's reactions to a spider. There are a few other good scares too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen a comedy in such a ridiculous style until I watched this movie.   It had an absolutely absurd ending.  It's a complete rip off of a comedy movie. The whole movie is a comedy.  There was no reason for that.  But the plot was interesting enough to make you laugh.  The ending was ridiculous.  I am sure this is a parody because the whole movie seems like a joke.  They could not have made this better.  This was a perfect film to watch with a friend who just started seeing a film every day.   The ending made me smile every time.  A must see for those who are into these kinds of films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie.   The movie is about a father and his young daughter who decide to go on a road trip to visit a new friend. The mother has the job of taking care of the daughter while the father is the main character.  The father is a good guy with a good family, but his love for the daughter has its limits.  It is a little too long but it is well worth the wait. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie     is an animated adventure about a strange bird in a strange world.   It   feels more like a live action   movie with some animated scenes.  It's funny and silly at first, but very dark at the end.  There is not much dialogue in this movie, but it   definitely   captures the feel of a   strange   place. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this one a lot, and I am a huge fan of movies like this one. A fun movie with a great cast, who was all great in their own right, the story is what made it so good, even though I don't think the film is that good in the end.   The acting was so much better than I expected, even when they are talking to someone for a long time, they were all good and funny.  They had fun in a movie they would have been able to laugh about for a lifetime. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Thing" (1979) is a science fiction/horror film that is certainly a masterpiece of what can be done in this field of cinema, and one that will surely be remembered by future generations as a landmark film of science fiction cinema.   The film was filmed in 1979 and is about a group of people in a nuclear bunker at a nuclear power plant who have a very strange experience after a freak accident in the bunker.  It has everything that would be expected from the film, including a great cast of characters, a story about a little boy who is lost in a world of wonder and wonders and a few very good scenes that really make the film a little more interesting than most films.  A very good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   " I think that there are a lot of movies in which someone in the early 1960's takes a young girl to a movie with the intention of seducing her. A few things that make this movie so interesting are the dialogue, the actors, the music. The first time you meet the boy, you just know you are going to have a great time with him. He does not try to seduce, or even be funny. You know what is really good about the dialogue? It's as good as the first time, except that there is no real story. But what a nice idea for a movie.    It's one of those movies that will leave you thinking about things that happened many years ago, and you are never the same. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an adaptation of the novel by the same title. The book is really not a good book in the first place, the action was really silly and a lot of it was really contrived. As I said in my first review, I'm a big fan of the movie, it's a great action movie. I like how it was all a bit more subtle than many action movies of this type.   It's an enjoyable movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   You can tell right away that this is a movie about the end of the world, and that it is very likely the world that ends on March 23, 2003.  There are other movies out there about that day, but none of them were quite as good as this one.  It is like the end times. It is a little hard to believe that this film has only been released in Japan.  But it is a film that many people, myself included, will like.  I think it is really funny.  The ending of the movie is a bit strange. It kind of comes out of left field.  This movie has the potential to be a big hit if it gets any mainstream distribution. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very enjoyable movie which is a story about a kid named Johnnie who wants to see the world.   When his parents (one a teacher, the other a professor) decide to take him out on a trip for the summer to the Caribbean and he misses the plane they take him to a resort.  The only thing missing is some fun, and that's what this movie is about, some fun.  It all starts with some kids who have a bunch of friends.  Then some girls who like to party come over and are a bit of a nuisance to them but then Johnnie notices they've been drinking a lot and decides to stop them.  Soon it's time for the boys to have fun and the kids do, some girls are in the group of them and one boy, who is a little more reserved than Johnnie, is not having any fun, but Johnnie isn't about to let his friends pass up the chance to take a break with him.  When all the friends start to have a good time the girls start to get jealous and Johnnie decides to have his fun with the girls, but then he notices that the boys are having fun and then all hell breaks loose.  You can't really go wrong with a boy and a girl in a resort, Johnnie's dad is a good guy, the teacher seems like a nice lady, the professor seems like he's not too bad either, and then of course the beautiful and sexy beach girls.  There is some pretty great acting in this one, but it is very entertaining as well.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but adults, it's a little bit too wild for their tastes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cast in this is so good it's almost unbelievable. I love a good villain so much that I actually thought that this was a spoof on the original X-Men cartoon. I am in love with the villain, played by Bruce Campbell who has that deep, dark voice and the acting is so well done. It's the best villain that I've seen. The cast is all over the place, but each one is a solid star and make the cast very complete.   This is the one of the best X-films I've watched and I am so looking forward to what's to come. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was directed by Robert Altman (which gives the film an old school feel, while still being modern.   This film is about two lovers who go from being close friends to lovers.  Robert Altmans direction and writing is so good, there are several scenes I could not stop thinking about (even up to the scene where the couple is on a walk and they find an old car with no driver and start to ride).   A wonderful love story with many of the scenes so realistic, it's just as if you were actually there with them, like the couple on a romantic walk, just looking at a beautiful sky. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never seen such an intense and complex film in my life.   This is a real "meltdown" movie and it has more depth than any Hollywood movie.  A very interesting character who is only shown at the beginning but at the same time a very mysterious guy and the most important character is the lead of this film and this movie and his whole life and relationships is totally understandable and real.  I think that this is the most accurate and true portrayal of life ever created.  This movie is a must see for any film fan or film critic who is a movie addict  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie more than once over the years and have always found it to be a fun comedy. It is like a version of 'Goodfellas' for the 80s.   It is set in a bar where everyone knows each other, but doesn't speak a word to each other. So you can just go with your gut feeling and watch what happens.  It was my first time watching this kind of movie and I was not disappointed at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has a bit of an unusual premise: a woman's husband, a physicist, is murdered in a garage in an apparently botched home invasion by an intruder with a knife. The main character, a young woman in a wheelchair named Laura, is given a chance to solve the case before anyone else can. What the movie lacks in plot twists, it makes up for in pacing and atmosphere, so the story is fairly well executed and I found it quite enjoyable to watch. The pacing was somewhat slow throughout the movie, but when Laura solves the case it is so satisfying that it does not really matter.   This movie is about as good as they come, I could see myself watching it over and over.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was about the character of David "The Fixer" Miller, a guy who is the fixer of the old people who lived in a house with other old people. This is the first story about the life of this character and the other characters. There was a nice comedy about a woman who had a new baby and a bad old woman who has a bad baby.   This movie is good and it has a good humor, great scenes, good action and it's a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, there is a reason this movie gets a lot of attention. You'll be watching this movie in the bathtub.   "Dinner party"   That's it. Dinner party.  The most beautiful dinner party. If the movies of my youth were like this one, the only difference would be the clothes and the music.  What's not to like about this movie?  First of all, this film was created to celebrate the 60th birthday of its director, Mr. Yevgeny Zamyatin. In the 50s, a young man, Yev geny, was hired by a rich man to develop a new type of electric car. He did his best to keep his job and he created the YC-40 model, which was a car that was supposed to be light, fast and quiet (it never got that). He built it from scratch in a small workshop in the village of Zhitomir. His work on the car never went completely as planned. It would have been much more successful if he had stayed in the United States and made the cars a little smaller, but Yev Geny was a simple man. He was too proud to leave home, and his wife was too worried about him to let him travel. Finally, in 1964, the model became a success and it became the model for the new type car. This is the story about YevGeny and the YCs-40: The first YC was very similar to the original German prototype. But it was not enough for the Germans. They wanted an even faster car that could take off from the ground and fly with the use of two jets (that's what the German engineers called the electric rocket). This would give them a clear advantage over the Soviets. YC and YC+ were too slow to fly, but they could accelerate so fast that they could go far beyond the capabilities of the German prototype (which was an L-4 or L-5). This is what caused the first big incident at the test site. The Soviets started a fire at the right-hand exhaust pipe. The Germans thought it was an oil leak, but the Soviets didn't find the leak. They thought that the pipe was cracked and had to be replaced. The Russians went to work without their spare parts and replaced the part that was missing. This gave them the advantage to finish the prototype before the Germans did. The prototype was completed in 1965 and it
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time.   It is about a bad neighbor who is always in trouble. He is a neighbor who does not have much sense and always gets in trouble because he does not listen to anyone. When one time he was having a party and he put up a lot of food so everyone had a nice time. Well all of the neighbors were there and they were so happy, especially the girl who came over to pick him up.  He was so drunk, so crazy. He kept asking the girl to get into his car and he just wanted to drive it home. Well the girl was not feeling well and she got very sick. He drove off and he was just going to drive to his house, where he lived. When he got there his wife told him that she was having stomach pains. He then went to get a doctor.  Now when I first watched this movie I was confused, I didn't know what was going on.  It looked like a bad movie but once I got a little more into it it all made sense.  This movie is so good!   My wife loved this movie and I thought it was great.  If you like a good laugh, some good plot lines and the story is a good one that has you on the edge of your seat for the entire time it is in the theaters.  I would recommend this movie to anyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a great movie that was made in a funny way by a great director that is doing his best at the moment and you will laugh out loud a lot because it is a real funny film.   A great story that can not be explained in a movie that is like an old fairy tale in every way.  In the world of fairy tale it is hard to find one that can say something new in the old story but the movie that follows it is just one that just keeps on giving you more and more new things to say.

And yes I saw this in a movie theater (the big one). But I think it would be okay at home.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is like a big, fat, smoky-haired, big-tentacled, hairy, hairy-legged, man-mouthed, hairy ass, dirty-diaper-loving, manly-man, big, beefy, hairy butt, big hairy guy from Hell who loves to suck the ass of women and who can go from a fat, hairy man to a tall, hairy guy with a massive, furry little manhood and big hairy, manky balls.   It is one of those movies that makes you feel like you are watching a cartoon that has been set in a modern city.  The characters are all in black and white, and they seem to speak in monosyllabic sentences or, in a couple of cases, just kind of repeat themselves or make up names for things.  One character who is never seen again in this movie is named Rufus (yes, a good name for a movie about a gay man from Hell).   And if that is not enough, he is played by a guy named Jack Jones, who is also, I guess, played by Michael Nouri.  All these people wear black robes.  I think the character who most resembles the movie's hero, the great Hercules of Athens, is played, not by Hercules, but by a black man, an unnamed man who was apparently killed by the movie hero in the movie.  It seems there was a rumor about the movie, or maybe some sort of rumor that was whispered, that there was supposed to be a sex scene in the film between Hercules and the movie character and the rumor was that Hercules was a gay character who liked to suck men's asses and he didn't want to lose his manhood to the movie actor who was the character's manly lover and boyfriend (I guess this would be the same thing that was talked about about Hercules in some old movie about King Arthur, starring Fred Astaire).  After Hercules was supposed not to lose a manhood (or more specifically, not lose any part of his manly, mangy ass) to the gay character, that rumor was supposedly made up and the scene was never shot, but then the rumor apparently got started again, because a few years after the movie was released, Hercules got gay again and he lost his man-parts in a way that is just awful.  Hercules is supposed to have an evil twin (whose name I have forgotten, but it
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I really thought this was going to be one of those films that the audience will like, however, it went the other way. Not bad. Not great. This film is about a young girl named Lucy who runs a diner that is only for people with money, but that's only because Lucy has all the money in the world. She has the most expensive things in the diner, and her little sister has the worst things. Lucy gets an opportunity to take over her aunt's diner, but she has a bad case of conscience when she discovers her little aunt is trying to kill her by poisoning her with rat poison. With the help of some friends, she gets caught and has to deal with the police and the police chief of a small town, who tries to help her. This is a fun little film that isn't all that scary, but is definitely a good comedy. The characters are all interesting, the jokes are good, and the animation is great. It's a good watch. I really thought I was going mad with laughter!

You have a great cast, a good story, good acting, a really good director... What more could you ask for?" - Anonymous "I was scared. I was in a car, and I was terrified, because you've got this guy who has these superpowers, but he's really a bad guy, and his goal is to do harm to other people, and he has all these little tricks... And he wants to use them on my family and me. He wants to be an evil mastermind, and it's all this horrible stuff." - Anonymous "I'm not the kind of person who looks at the camera and shouts a lot or has a lot of action in his movies, but you can tell that a lot was put into this one." - Steve G. "The characters are likeable and likable characters." - Matt M. The review is written from the perspective of a 15 year old female who did not expect a horror movie to be so good and to have so much gore.  There are several scenes in the film where she is almost killed in one of the worst ways possible. The gore is in an obvious way, especially when you are watching this with someone who is not too familiar with the movies. The scenes of the characters being attacked by the creature are really cool and well done. I loved it, and hope to see more from this great cast in the future.

I am very disappointed the only characters that we get to meet are the main character and his little sister.

This story is told from the point of view of the boy. He gets lost in the forest and is eventually found by the father who is hunting a deer. The movie is set during a snow storm and is very well shot. The acting is excellent. It is not a comedy but a drama with lots of tension. The camera work is very good as well. There are several very good performances. The director did a great job of creating a story about two families and one boy that is lost in this wilderness. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been a fan of the Marvel Universe since I saw Amazing Fantasy #15. When they started on their own line I was immediately intrigued because the concept seemed too cool to be true. The series continued to be very entertaining and even at this stage it still had all the hallmarks of what made the first Avengers so great.   This time the story was in a much more intimate setting where the heroes were more grounded in the real world and it was more relatable to what people in America went through.  The characters were a mix of both old and new. The first one I liked was Steve Rogers. His naivete was so endearing and his desire to not let people down was very admirable.  Avengers 2   Tony Stark's the main character of this film. A nice change of pace from the first one in that he was a much bigger threat.  He was no longer a billionaire playboy who could buy his way into any situation. He was a man with a much larger agenda who was far more self aware than he let on.  His motivation for being a hero was still there but he wasn't the leader he was when the first film began. He had to be.  This was a very solid film.  I liked it.

This movie had a good start, with the detective and a few other characters in the investigation, and the ending was good as well.    I recommend this to anybody.  "I can't believe it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A brilliant science fiction comedy with a fantastic plot and a memorable cast.   I'm not exactly sure how to review a movie with a premise like this, but I'd say it's about a scientist who comes back from outer space to Earth.  I was really surprised that it was so good.  And the dialogue is a lot of fun, especially when they go off in a different direction.  A bit strange.  The plot is pretty simple.  It's about two aliens who are visiting Earth and the scientists they meet.  You could just call it the aliens are too cool, but that isn't quite right.  They are scientists.  But the aliens want to explore, not conquer.  There is a little romance between two of the scientists, and I loved it.  Their costumes are beautiful.  In fact, my only complaint about the movie is that there aren't a lot more aliens.  However, I'm really happy that we got so many aliens in the movie.  This movie is great!  I really liked the aliens. They were so different and funny, and the story was interesting.  Also, one of the things I thought was really clever about the whole movie was that when the two aliens went off in another direction, they just didn't look like they had any clothes on.  I really liked this movie!

Although the show itself was pretty terrible, it was still a fun show and even though there was a whole lot of characters, the main character, Lion and the rest of the cast were pretty entertaining.   After seeing Lion Guard I was pretty disappointed when it was taken off the air.  It was a great cartoon and I'm hoping one day we can see the show back on the air as an animated TV series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very surprised at how well this movie plays out - the first hour or so is a typical horror movie with a small town filled with monsters and a couple of creepy kids.   The movie was really not bad, but this movie seemed to be the weakest of the lot.  The only thing that really stuck with me, in regards to how well it played out was the "ghost" from the town.  There are a couple movies that were released in the 70s which were pretty good, but it was kind of a waste to see a movie that was so bad when the director was in charge.

It is a story about a young man who is in love with his mother, and a young girl who has grown up on the streets in her father's house.

A movie I would suggest to people who like a good story that is set in the American South.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very good film with a great story line. I think this is one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. It is a good way to get to know a side of the US military. The character of Lt. McQueen is a great character. He is a man who is dedicated to the military. He loves the military and wants to do anything and everything to help keep the peace. He has a strong and very well written voice and his character is a strong one. The military, although they do not have the best equipment, they do have a great training program and Lt.McQueen is very knowledgeable about his equipment. He knows the military equipment is excellent and will protect his unit. I really enjoyed this movie.   I give this movie a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I have not had a chance to watch it again since watching it for the first time. This film has a great storyline that makes for great viewing.

The movie is about a little boy who can see spirits in the trees and they are good or bad   When the evil spirits try to stop him he needs help from a boy in the tree who can guide him but the boy isn't really in the movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is the only good thing about this film. I like the way the story is written, it is the little details that make this a good picture.   At first you are wondering what the big deal is, but then it all begins to make sense when we learn of the origin of the demon. The only other thing I like is the music.  A nice little movie with some good characters and a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't remember a movie before I saw this that I liked so much, and that's saying a lot because I was a big fan of the first two installments. This movie is much less of a rip-off and it actually comes close. I don not see why the writers of this movie didn't write a screenplay that would work as a movie, because it's a good one and a great one! You've got an older brother who's been playing the drums since he was about 8 and he's been at it for over 30 years, so he has a good head on his shoulders and knows what he's talking about. I always figured the story of the drums came from the Brothers Grimm and some other tales about a man who's father was a drummer and got himself killed at a drum circle. This is all very strange but it's all true and it all makes sense. The movie has some nice music and a bit of a mystery to it so it's kind of a mix between The Wizard of Oz and The Secret of NIMH.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that you are right in this case, this movie is a great movie that you should have in your movie collection. I was a bit confused when I started this movie and I thought it was going to be a boring movie but all the things that it has is not boring at all.   For the first time in a long time a good alien movie and a good scary movie.  A nice movie with an interesting plot.  I liked the movie very much and I recommend this movie for all the people who like the Alien movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as a movie that tries to create a whole new type of movie, this one doesn't fail to do that.   The story is very unique with a story that has a twist ending and a twist that will most likely leave you scratching your head.  It may not make sense at first, but once you get the story, you will be on the edge of your seat to see how it plays out.  There's a very good villain and a pretty good cast that keeps things fun.  As for the plot,  I liked it enough to give it a 10 for the main character and 9 for the movie.  Overall, it's just good fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie is "The Devil's Advocate" starring Peter Sellers.   It's got some great comedy, some heart breaking stuff, some excellent acting and one of my favorite movies ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say, this movie is a masterpiece of a movie. If the story were not so amazing, it would not have been that good.   It is based off of a book by a woman named Susan, the book is called,  Soma.  Soma, is the love story of two lovers, one of the lovers is a female, one is a male.  In the beginning the story is just a good little story of the two people falling in love and then a very disturbing turn of events.  The story does not last long, and after the first episode, nothing much is said about what is going on in the story, the ending, is still unexplained.  I was not sure if I was supposed to like the girl, or not.  A lot of things were done in this movie that I would not be surprised if the story of Soma was done in a more conventional way.  This is one of those movies where the story doesn't end.  It leaves you hanging on every twist and turns in the movie, and a few things that I found completely impossible to believe that I never saw coming.  When you watch this movie you have to be a very careful person, because this movie will leave you speechless.  If you know anything about Soma, you have been left speechless a few times in this film.  There is nothing but beauty, and it is not easy to find.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the great thrillers of the '60's. When you go to see it, you won't be disappointed.   You can expect a good film at times, but nothing too spectacular.    The only bad thing about the film is that it didn't have a title.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said in the beginning, you know you are in for a bad time when the lead actor is the voice of a crying baby.   This movie is filled with many bad jokes, bad dialogues and terrible acting. The ending is very bad and the movie seems like it's going nowhere at all.  In fact, it's probably better to skip this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film has a nice mix of humor and some serious issues.   This is a film about two teens who live in a poor neighborhood.  Their father is a drug addict who has problems with his health (his body looks like it is about to fall apart).  One night, after he is about done with a session, he gets a message that tells him about a mysterious cult called The Family.  He finds a girl (Tiffany) and two guys (Bobby, a gang leader) who join The Family and lead a life of crime.  After a few days of this, The Family gets into a fight with The Man from the Sun.  The two men (who have been hypnotized) are about to fight and the Man from The Sun saves the day, killing the rest of The Family except for his son, who was with him.  When he gets back to his family, he notices that his son is no longer the same.  His body is different and it seems like his mind is working on a different level.  One day, the mother (Tina Turner) is taking him to the doctor. She is talking about the "new girl" he has.    The father (Timothy Dalton) is angry that he didn't get to talk to the girl and his new friend. He is convinced that they are both working for The Family, the man and the girl.  While waiting for the doctor, the father notices that the girl is getting ready for school and a big fight is about go down.  This gets him thinking about The Family again and the idea of his son joining.  Tina Turner is great in this film, she is not quite as good in her role as she was in the TV series but she does an excellent job of playing the angry, spoiled teen.     It was a great movie to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Last of the Mohicans" is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in a while. It's a little difficult to follow the story because there are many characters and it's difficult to keep track of them all. In one particular scene, a man is walking down the river with his baby in his arms. This particular scene is so moving. You can really feel the emotion of the baby as he's walking down to the sea. That alone made this movie great to watch. I don't know about you but I was able to relax and not feel the tension and dread so common to so many movies today. The colors and film were great too. "The movie is a lot of fun but it's also a bit silly. That's not a bad thing at all."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're looking for a good action movie, look no further.   The plot is predictable, the ending is predictable (they're the same people), but there are some fun bits that will be re-watched.  It's the kind of movie you might see in an R-rated movie with a ton of violence but with more of a PG-13 feel.  Like a lot of films from the 70s, they were able to incorporate a lot more of science fiction than was typical, and this movie has plenty of the former.  A lot of the action happens in the middle of the movie which is not really a big deal, but I think that when the movie was over, they could have had a good laugh.  Overall, a good, quick action movie that's not too long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie. The movie is good enough. The story is good. It is not really a story. There are no big events or anything. What happens is that the good people take a trip on the river in the middle of the day, so that they will not be disturbed by the bad guys. One bad guy is hiding in the woods. He wants to go home. This is the plot of the movie. There is a couple of great special effects in the movie and a couple good special effects shots. This movie looks good. The bad guy can't really do anything against the good guys.

It is one of those movies you can't see the end of, and never have the ending be quite as satisfying.  The Thing has a great cast, and a great idea.  If you have a horror movie on your brain (and you know you do) then you need to watch this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is my favorite movie, even though I haven't seen the original series.   I would say it is a sequel to the original show (though not based on the anime).   It is about a family of monsters that have the human and a human child.  There are several episodes dedicated to this story, though the original episodes are in the sequel.  In the first episodes, they have a problem and have to find a solution to it.  Also, it is worth saying that they seem to be very human, and their family is a mixture of many different races.  It's all very fascinating, and fun to watch.  My only problem with this movie is that the first few episodes were extremely slow and boring.  I think the first couple of episodes were all about explaining why they are being called monsters.  This might be because I was bored and just watching a good horror movie to pass the time.  The ending was a bit weird, but it wasn't too bad.  And the music is good, just like I hoped it would be.  Overall, this is a good sequel to a good show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a great example of "A-B-A-L-E-S-D-E" filmmaking.   It tells a well-developed, interesting story, the best being the one about the lost-and-found dogs, that are later found by a small family.  For those who like good stories, this one is a must-see.  I had a lot of fun watching this movie.  Also, a special mention should go to the music, the opening theme of the movie, is one of the most catchy music pieces ever!    Recommend this movie to everyone, even those who have no interest in dogs! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll start this review with a spoiler.   In all honesty, it doesn't need to be a spoiler because it is a good film!   The story follows the lives of five high school girls who are all in a funk.  One of them, Hannah, gets an invitation to a dance hosted by the school's basketball coach.  It's a very cool party with lots of people, and a few surprises along the way.  Another girl, Zoe, has a big crush on a popular boy.  The main character of this film is Samantha.  Samantha is a very interesting character.  When you first see her, you don't think you are going to fall in love with her, but as the movie progresses you really do.  I won't ruin any of the surprises and mysteries the movie raises, but I will let the movie speak for itself.  Although there is no time travel in this movie, it does have a very mysterious ending!  Overall, I enjoyed this movie very much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An American classic.   A wonderful story about a young girl who is born blind, and as a result is unable to speak.  A loving and devoted mother and brother.  The main character is very different than the typical girl that I knew as a child and what I think is why I loved it so much:  "I'm a blind girl who doesn't have a word to say...my parents are so beautiful...I am the only blind girl in a house full of people who think I'm pretty...they've never called me a sightless girl...they say I'm a beautiful girl and I'm so happy...I have no words for them. They're like angels to me...no one can get me to cry."   The film is about her trying to keep her spirits up as her mother falls more and more in love with her, while her brother is getting into the whole "blind girl in the house" routine, and she is beginning to lose sight of her mother's true love.  However, she does have a sense of humor and she finds some of her own voice.  After seeing this, I have to say: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film that I was talking about earlier. A movie that does not need to be re-made. It was good. I enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen the trailer for this film before watching it, and I thought it was well put together. It seemed to be about a young woman (Lily James), who meets and befriends an elderly blind man (Michael J. Fox) on his bus, he was blind when he left home and lives alone in a shack. He was quite kind and nice, but he seemed to forget about Lily at times and that was a little scary for her. They get along very well. When she gets off the bus, the blind man says she looks like a woman who has just lost her baby and that is a very sad comment. She takes a bus the next day and ends up at a house by the road that is run by a man named Jim (John Lithgow). He is a big burly man, who is married to Lily's Auntie. Jim thinks he is a little slow but gets by ok with his little house. In the house there is a boy named Tommy (John Cusack). The boy seems to be a bit of a rebel and Lily wants to know about him. At first, Tommy seems to like her, but that changes as he sees the things she does with him. The other house-maid, Mrs. T.C. (Ann-Margret) and the dog are not very fond of Lily. Lily and Jim try to help the boy (who they call Billy). This is where it starts to get a little difficult. Lily finds a diary and starts to write about the things that happen to her when she has sex with Jim. She starts to tell all about her life and what she is doing with Jim and Tommy. Then Tommy comes into the picture. Lily, Tommy and Jim have fun together. There is a great little sequence with the boys' dad (Peter Fonda) at home with Billy and Tommy (after Billy has broken his legs). Peter comes over to see if things are all right. Peter gets a lot of things wrong with this movie but he has a great performance and I felt he really gave Tommy a real life and heart. This is a beautiful movie and one that should be seen by everyone who likes to see a good old fashioned romance.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only time when I felt I missed out on a movie was when my partner and I were leaving the theater in the afternoon, but before we went out, we went to visit the local coffee shop for a coffee and some pastries. We talked a bit about our previous visit to The Book of Life, a documentary about the life of a young girl who was killed in a house fire, and how her sister was in jail for her role in the fire. This time, we talked about our upcoming trip to London to see the world. I mentioned that we had to stay in a hotel for the night since the train from London to the airport was delayed a bit and the room we were booked for was only available for guests, which meant that we were going to have to sleep on the floor in a cold hotel, but they gave us a room so we would be able to enjoy it while we went on our journey.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie for the first time about 15 years ago. It was the first movie I ever saw with an African American lead. I loved his performance and all the scenes in the theater that were filmed in black and white. I was about 9 years old. I will never forget seeing a white guy play a black guy. It made me believe that a black man could be just as cool as a white man. And it was true. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When a movie about a movie comes out... I was more than prepared to be disappointed when I watched this. The movie did not disappoint. It was a slow start, but as the movie progresses, the pace increases. The pace is very well executed. The scenes were well written, with a few jokes thrown in. The characters are well drawn. There was little to no special effects, but that is no reason to knock this movie. The music was pretty good. There were a few cheesy moments when the characters got angry, but not so much so that the movie had to change gears. The pacing was good, the story was good. The acting, by itself, would be worth a look. There is nothing much else to say, other than the story should be listened to once the movie is finished.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a must see movie for the fans of the original movie and those who haven't seen it and would like to see it again.   It takes place at the end of World War II, and there is a big battle raging.  There is a great cast of characters, including the German doctor, and the Russians, including a Russian general.  It is a classic of the genre that is full of suspense.  The special effects in this movie are wonderful.  I was always a big fan of Dr. Strangelove and thought this was the best of the Dr.  Strangeloves.  This movie is just as good if not better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The biggest problem with The Longest Yard is that it has no ending. If you want to know the ending of the movie you're going to have to do a lot of reading between the lines as to why this guy, who appears to be so kind and generous in the movie is such a dick in the end. The ending is certainly satisfying in that it puts everything to rest in that horrible scene where the detective is shot in the head and falls in the water. However, I still have no idea why they shot him in the first place.   It's a really enjoyable movie, and while it can't be recommended to everyone it does offer some nice insights into the lives of people caught up in a city of violence. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching it last night for the first time and it's a great movie.   It's a really good story about a young boy who finds a book about a girl that he knows from school.  He follows her and finds out her true story about why she left.  The girl is really good and her brother is the worst person ever.  You should also know that the book is a fictional account of a girl who was raped and murdered.  It does get really bloody but its not that violent.  Also I was a bit disappointed that the girls mom was never in this movie but her role is just there.  Overall a really fun movie.

The movie begins with the cats trying to help the girl with the snake. The movie is filled with fun and exciting sequences which all make it a good watch.  I did not like the cat scene in the first movie but this one I like better.  It is just a short movie and I was able to watch the whole thing but I am still looking forward for the "Golf" and the "Sparrow" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was completely satisfied with this movie: 1: the story line is good, the actors are good, and the actors bring an interesting character (it's a "sister" to the brother I have seen on TV), and she is beautiful, she is a very well written girl, she's young, she wants to change her life and not go back to her old life (that was the reason for the murder) which is what she needs (she has a sister who wanted to change things and get married to a big man, who is in love with a big woman) she had to change the way she was living her life to fit the society, but she did change and I really like the way a good story is handled: like in the movie "The Perfect Crime" when one has to change, one has do it in the middle of the movie when everything goes wrong, so she can go back and live her life.   Her character is very good, but I wouldn't say it's like a girl I can love because it is very different from the girl I'm interested in and would like to know more about: it's better to me to watch a movie about a girl who is very pretty, a great singer, a good writer, a very good person, who goes about her business and makes a living.  The first movie is about a killer and he is really a bad guy, he's a bad boy who has an attitude and a sadistic attitude, he has a sadism which will help him if he's caught because he'll have the death penalty, and his mother who gave him a bad name is a bad person, she gives him an "A" and a bad attitude (she didn't let him have friends, her husband told her that he wanted to have a boy, but he had no one, and she was the best one to take care of him... the father died after giving birth to him, so the mother gave birth to a boy who was in trouble from the very beginning... she was a bad mother, the boy was bad, he was an "un" boy, and he didn't have a mother who was a good person...   The movie "Pagliacci" is about an old man and his friend who go to the "Pagnano del Caravaggio" in Italy (he's a little kid when he was a boy...) and they go to a theater, and they're watching
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you who haven't seen the film, The Day the Earth Stood Still is a classic sci-fi film in the tradition of 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Incredible Hulk, Planet of the Apes, and Star Wars.   Director Stanley Kubrick was the man who made Dr. Strangelove and The Shining.  He is responsible for the likes of 2001,  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the A-Team, and even Dr. Seuss.  At its core The Day The Earth Stank is an allegory about man's desire to explore the universe, explore other worlds, and the need to respect the natural world.  And to a man and woman who are about to set sail for a month on an open boat to Mars, that is what this film is about. The story follows a group of explorers in their spaceship, The Odyssey, who are on a round the world trip to explore an ancient world and try to figure out how it all started.  The film also features a large ensemble cast of actors who are all excellent.  Of particular note is the actor who plays the main character, a man named Ray Charles, a young man with a passion for exploring the world, and a huge ego.  This ego leads him to do some very stupid things that lead him to a very unhappy end, and although it isn't his fault, he has to deal with it in the end.  A very strong performance from Charles.  Ray Charles in The Day Earth Stink:  This is the first time in a long while I have been happy with a movie.  I don't remember the last time I was truly in love with a film, and I am not going to say that this was an exception to the rule.  Even so, The day the earth stood still was an amazing movie. It was a great story that made for a very enjoyable viewing.  It had all the elements of a great sci- fi adventure.  There were action scenes that were very cool, and there were some great music themes.  One of the things that really sold me on this movie was the look of it.  For all the sci- sci- amie elements the film looked like a Hollywood movie. There were plenty of people in spacesuits and the environment looked like it could be real.  After the credits there was a few short clips from the film to see, but the whole movie seemed to

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a wonderful movie and i enjoyed it as much as my other favorite movie   "The Godfather".   The film is very well written and the actors and actresses did their jobs well.   There are several interesting plot points in the film and the last 10 minutes are very good and give you a lot of hope for the future of a great film.  The acting is great and the direction is great. The ending is a little weak but it isn't a major problem.  "Godfather" has all the ingredients of a classic and it is very rewarding to watch it.  There's nothing much to say about this movie. It's just a little story about a family going through a change in the mid 1970s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is quite an interesting idea of a horror movie in which the main character is a psychic who helps his friends by reading their dreams and nightmares. The most interesting element about the movie is that the protagonist has a little sister who doesn't speak. However, the mother is a very interesting character. This movie had a good horror vibe, however, the special effects are not to my liking.

So, a lot of us came for the special effects and a few laughs. It was all of those. And, it was a nice movie with a few good actors. However, it would not be a good place for a woman to go in the movie. Her clothing was really, really short. And she didn't have the "bodice of steel" that the men had.   It was not too long after the movie was over when we were going to leave. I can't even tell you all the nasty things a group of young kids said to the ladies. All of the women I saw were very, very skinny. The movie just wasn't good for women to go to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie you really have to see if you want to feel you are getting to the heart of what made the movie good.   Director Stuart Gordon uses his usual style of low budget to bring in a great character like the one we all remember and love.  We are seeing a very sad story and a character who is trying to figure out how to keep a job and the people he loves from being taken away from him.  This is a movie of the heart and of the people.  I'm sure we can all relate to how hard it can be to make ends meet and keep a roof over your head when you have a job in a very competitive field that is constantly changing.  I think that in a way this movie captures our modern problems that we face as a society. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is not a bad movie and i would definitely recommend this movie to everyone as an entertaining movie that does its job of entertaining, it is not the best of the bunch (you have to go and see the others for that, that's how bad it is) and as such, it did a great job of getting what it was trying to achieve, but unfortunately, it only got half the way there. This movie has a lot of issues, and it is very hard to enjoy this at all, it has to do with the plot and the way that it is presented.   The story begins in a far away city of ancient China, and the main character, Xiao Yu (yes he is that stupid) sets off in an ancient car. After travelling for a few hours, it arrives at an industrialised city where a whole bunch of old people have come out of hiding to look at an object in a factory that has been abandoned for years.  Now, i could talk all day about what this is supposed to be about, but i am afraid that i am going to run out of time and will probably be talking about this movie for ages, and that will probably make it sound a bit like a review for a bad comic book movie.  I guess i can sum up what the story is about by saying that it revolves around an old woman who has been working as a maid in the industrialised area of China for many years and has become completely obsessed with this factory.  What makes this movie so interesting is that it does not need to have a coherent story, it's told in a mixture of different perspectives and styles.  It would be fair to say that this movie is very slow paced and has to spend a lot more time explaining how things work than actually showing you the results of it.  There is a scene where a bunch of men try to open a door, but the doors are locked, and they have to cut a hole through with a torch in order to get in.  A lot of the other characters in the movie are not given as much screen time as the main lady, who does all the talking, but they make their presence felt.  The way that the story was presented is that the old woman is an incredibly powerful being that has spent most of her life in this factory and knows a lot about it. She wants a child, but she is too old to have any. The men that she has to deal with have lost the ability

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was amazing!! Not too long ago my wife and I went out and had a few drinks at a bar. My wife asked her best friend if she knew any good movies, and the friend replied with one that she thought she had seen. I didn't know about that movie but it was good, she wanted to go again. When we got home we went through a couple of the films on the DVD we had, but we didn't have a chance to watch the film because my wife wanted to see it again before she went to bed. I think she liked the film, but it just wasn't enough.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many other reviews, I was very much taken by this movie. I am not really a horror fan, but I am a big fan of horror films, and this one was really cool. I really liked that the guy was only dressed in a mask. There were a lot of really cool shots in this movie: a really cool opening, with the girl talking to a guy, and then he gets a mask and starts killing all the other people. Then a cool scene where the girl gets sucked in a pipe, and we get a very scary, good ending (which I think could have been made better).   I think that if there were a real clown living next to you, you would freak out and try to avoid him.   But this movie is pretty much just a bunch of cool scares, and a lot is done with the lighting, which is pretty cool.  The last 10 minutes were really scary, and I did not enjoy it all.  I gave it a 4 out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is about a woman who was given a gift by the god of life, which in this movie was a big bottle of wine. But after drinking all this wine the woman was a sickly woman. The woman had a huge stomach, and could hardly move. She could barely walk. When she was sick, the god told the man that he should not look for her, she had run off to some mountain, and he would get to her there. But when he goes there, the girl asks him to marry her. But the man, who is an old man, cannot stand her. So he leaves, but when he was on his way home, he sees a woman sitting on a hilltop, and she asks him if she can marry him. He says yes, and as soon as the woman comes down to earth, she tells him that she is very sick. She tells him what has happened. And the man thinks that this has been a cruel prank of the god, and is just a joke, but the girl says, "No it is not, this is not a joke". The girl has died, and the man does not really believe this, so he goes and has a good cry, and goes to a mountain. He goes there and sees her grave. It has been destroyed by a fire. After he has had a good scream, he starts running up and down, and finally he is able to climb up and see her grave, and then he gets to the top of the hill, and has to carry her up. He does not know how to get the girl up. But suddenly he finds her. She is all covered in dirt, but still she is alive. He asks her where she has been, and in the back of her mind, she says, that she had to get back home and find her father. She says, when she gets home, she is going to tell him all about how the god has tricked her. The boy, who has been with her all this time, finally understands, and starts to cry as well. After the girl has been buried, the boy finally gets up and goes back to his home. He tells his father what happened. He is very disappointed at the god. His father is very angry. But his father's anger doesn't really get the boy very angry at all, because he is a good son. He takes care of his father, and loves him. So at the end of the movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film had a fairly short and sweet run time but it did it's job as a science fiction story of an interstellar conflict that would have been interesting if not for the film's lack of any real character development.   This isn't a bad movie by any means but it isn't very good either.  The reason is because while the story can be interesting, the film itself doesn't.  Even though there were some interesting moments that gave this film a little bit of life, it couldn't save it from being a forgettable sci-fi adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a little girl, I went to see a movie called "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" about a princess. One thing I liked about it was how they gave the girl a pet alien.   A nice little pet.  But, the princess got a little cocky, and I mean like, a little evil, and she killed him.  What a mess.  The bad guys got out.  I remember I was in second grade, and we had the movie, so we all got the action figures.  We had a bunch of action figures that were just like the figures from the movie.  So, we all had these little guys, and they had things to throw, and things to do.  And they looked so cool.  Then, in the movie a little guy jumps up out of the swamp in the middle of the movie and looks at us like we were stupid for liking this movie. He was just a little, little guy. He didn't have any super powers.  "Come on guys, we are going to get through this! The whole movie is about how we are stupid for going to see the movie!"   There is a lot of movie like this about, you know, this princess, and then she kills the guy.  You know, you do get a little bit of a feel for it after a while.  There were some cute aliens in it, like a little boy and a little sister, but that was about it.  When "Star Trek" first came out, I liked that about it, that I thought "Oh, maybe I'll be a ship captain."  But then, when "Star Raiders" came out I didn't like it at all.  Well, maybe the movie did get a bit better, but I just don't like "Star Treks."   Like, they don't look cool. They look like two or three guys with a little robot in a space suit.  No, I don't think they look really cool. It is just kind of a boring space ship thing.  Maybe it is better than "Back to the Future" because they did more with that.  It is a nice space movie with some good science fiction elements, but it has some bad parts to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure why I haven't seen this one before now. This is my first attempt at reviewing a movie, so I'm sure I'm doing something wrong. Still, a good first hour and a half in a film with a lot of tension, which has been somewhat lacking in Hollywood lately.   This is a big action film from the early 70s, about a secret government organization (I think) called The Blue Berets that goes from one mission to another, with a group of soldiers who are given a mission, one that may have been assigned to them by a military superior who might or might not be related to the leader of the Blue Bereys, who is an alien.  There are also some good jokes and a few of the acting scenes in this are quite good, especially the one when one of the soldiers goes to kill a snake with a nail file that is supposed to be poison, but it's still deadly.  This has some good action scenes, mostly in the helicopters, with some very scary scenes at night with a helicopter that is flying very slowly around, and then crashes.  A lot of fun in my opinion.  It's very fast paced with good dialogue and a good script, but there's also a little bit of melodrama, so it's not perfect.  I think it's a good action film, so if you're a fan of that kind of thing, or if you have seen a lot from the period, then this one is for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening of the film is a very good opening which shows a beautiful landscape, then a helicopter shows up and we have a short opening sequence of them getting ready to take off. The pilot of the helicopter is a nice and quiet guy, with a friendly voice and a very nice outfit, and we soon learn who he is. The first sequence shows him talking to a woman and she calls him the son of a bitch, and this kind of attitude is typical of the pilot. He also gets in a plane, and it's a good plane but it's too small to take anyone on. After he takes off he has a few scenes with a nice girl, who is a prostitute, she tells him that he is a cockroach and then he flies off and a nice shot shows him at a beautiful location with an Italian woman at the top of a mountain. They get in a car and drive to a small town, but then he has another problem with the car that will probably lead to a bad accident. There's a lot of things going on that I'm not going to discuss here, but it ends with a bad crash. The second scene, which is very good, shows a group of kids playing, and the kids get drunk and start dancing, and they dance well.   But then this happens and it gets a little weird:  The scene with the boy was a real pain in the ass and it was just awful.  I really wish the director would have cut it off here and gone on, but that would have been an enormous loss to the movie.  The scene with a lady who is really into him had to be cut in a hurry.  It seems like one minute she is really attracted to him and the next minute he is completely uninterested and has to pull away.  So the lady decides to try and get him to play with her, and she tries a couple of things which she doesn't like, but nothing really works. Finally she throws a bone to her lover, but he won't touch it. So the scene ends with the lady getting hit by a car, and then the rest of the movie is about the guys trying to recover the car and the lady and her lover try to get into the car.  The music is good, the acting is very decent, and I loved the end where a nice little flashback shows how the guys got the car, because it is a good little touch, but I think it should

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't seen the movie, it's on Youtube: https://youtu.be/3o0nf1z6YnY The movie takes place in a large, empty city with little to no people. It's a city that's about to be taken over by a terrorist group. The terrorist group kidnaps the President of the city, and they take her out of the country to take over the city. The only thing that can save the city is the military, which is about to run out of ammo. So they must be the last line of defense against the terrorists.   The movie is quite good. It starts out in a very slow pace, and it isn't until the second half that you feel like the movie is going to have an impact. But then it does, and you get to see a pretty good amount of action, explosions, and a good amount to know about the characters.

It got me so angry, but I felt sorry for that guy (who turned out to be a psychopath, so I can't sympathise with him).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those who don't know the background of the movie it is a movie about a group of cops who are assigned to break into a car with the help of a friend who has a truckload of stolen cars. But these aren't just any cars, these are the most dangerous cars on the road and this friend is an ex-cop so the car breaking job is done with ease. The cop crew is split up into groups of two with the cop who's friend was a cop, the other cop who was a car thief and the last cop who is a little scared.   This isn't a great movie at all. Not only does it have a poor storyline but the acting isn't that great either. The movie does have it's good points though: the movie is full of interesting characters and you are able to figure out what is going on. The music is a nice change from the average car movies you get all too often. You can't say enough about this movie it really has it's ups and downs but overall this isn't the worst car movie you will ever see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The movie "The Black Stallion" is an excellent fantasy. It is a unique fantasy, that takes place in the middle ages. There is a great adventure that takes us all the way from the North to the South. Our main character is called The Black Stall of the North, and he is a very brave and daring hero. He has to find the way to get his horse back to his owner, that's where we start the journey of the movie. This movie has it all: the fight scenes, the romance, the magic, the characters, and the magic of the story. This is a must see for anyone interested in fantasy movies.

My only problem was that I was so bored. I wish I could see it again. This movie is all over the place. I just wish there were more of the scenes like the one with the "manicure" (my words). I loved the movie because it has so many funny scenes. As a matter of fact, the movie has some great lines in it. I will have to see the movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent science fiction thriller.   It was pretty darn good.  As I mentioned, this film was pretty damn good. The story is about an engineer named Robert (played by the great Charles Coburn) who is looking for his missing wife, and then meets a man who claims to be a man named John and the two of them go off to look for her. Then things start to get interesting as the two men are working together and soon find out that something more sinister than mere murder is afoot.  In fact, things get even better as the film develops as each plot point gets developed. The screenplay was done very well. In fact one reviewer even called it one of the best of all time.  A little bit darker in tone than the first one (and also more like a TV movie), but pretty much as good, if not better, as the first film.  The acting is great and the directing, script, and sound mixing are all done quite well.  This is one of those "best of" science fiction films I've seen.

It looks awful, and the acting is terrible.  When it's over, we know what the plot was about.  I don't care what the writer has to say.  The movie doesn't make any sense!  I hate to say it, but this movie sucks.  So don't watch it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is interesting in that it shows how a small town like Woodstock, Alabama could fall under a big city's control, and in the process, the citizens of Woodstock get their own version of the Hollywood ending: the guy who is trying to take over the town, gets tired of it and moves to a more pleasant town. In the process the townsfolk get a taste of their own medicine as they come to realise that they can't just ignore a whole lot of good things about their town. I give the movie a 3/5 rating, as it is an interesting story about what happens when a small community has the ability to throw out its old leaders, and decides they would rather live in a larger town than continue to live in Woodstock.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 3/4ths of the film are pretty standard fare. The main characters are pretty much typical, the plot doesn't move much and doesn't make much sense, and the ending was a little rushed. I was really hoping to see some more of a different direction, because the plot is pretty uninspired and the characters pretty much all look like they got dragged from a children's party and slapped on a movie set.   And that's pretty much the end of the plot for most of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll begin by saying I really liked this movie. The music is great, the acting is great. But as usual, the plot is a little thin, but it does have some good thrills along the way.   The first thirty minutes or so of this movie are an average action movie.  For the next twenty-five minutes, the action gets really good and you can't help but be engrossed.  And it starts to get good around the half way mark.  At this point in time, I'm really happy with this movie because it's well made, it's fun to watch and it does a good job at getting the audience in the mood for a good old fashioned action movie with some blood and guts.  This movie has a few weak moments, but I think that most of the problems are either down to bad editing or poor acting.  But I think these are more of a problem than anything else.  It's a fun action flick, but the story really doesn't come across as good as I'd like.  There are some really good moments in this movie, and while I like the cast of characters and the action, the pacing of the story is off, and I wish the movie had a little more time in it, but as I said it's all about action and excitement.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie which not only deals with the idea of the afterlife, but also with the questions about life. As such, it is one of the best movies I have seen. The plot is really simple: we follow a woman who loses her husband in a terrible traffic accident. In the hospital, the doctor, a very nice man, is very nice to her, but she has to deal with the reality that her husband is gone, and she is left alone. So she tries to find something to occupy her mind: a woman's diary is found by a friend who, while trying to make a fortune from it, finds out that it is full of the most disturbing sexual fantasies, including rape. When the friend comes back to England, he immediately informs the police and the police soon find out what happened. Written by Steve Harris <smr91@hotmail.com>
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was awesome.   It has all the characters and plots you would want.  The only downside was that the villain seemed to be a little too predictable.  Also I think it's pretty obvious how it ends and if I get the film in 3D, it will be even better.  So if you are a fan of action films or want to see some awesome action in a short time, then this is a must-see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Godfather" is the third part of a trilogy, the second one being "The Untouchables". The series was based on the novel written by Mario Puzo which, however, was never made into a film. "The Italian Job" and "The Long Goodbye" had to make up for this shortcoming in a way, making a film of "The Italians" as it is not a straight on adaptation of the novel. There is a strong plot which has been woven into the story from the beginning, but most of the movie is focused on the interactions of Vito and his son Carlo. The film starts off with Vito's father getting beaten up by a mob and in the next scene Vito is on his way to the United States to kill his son's enemy. He has to go to an Italian restaurant called Il Mercato to meet the other members of the Italian mafia to see who is the boss. Here Carlo is very young and looks like an ordinary child, but he is a man with a very wicked mind. He does not like to have people talking about him, he wants his people to remain in the shadows. One of the many murders that Vito sees is that of a man's son. Vito kills his father and takes his son into the Italian home of a woman named Beatrice (Martha Marcy May Marlene), whom he had to take a vow of silence about. At the same time Vito comes across a young man who is a good friend of his son. He is called Frank and he tells him about the circumstances of his death. V, not knowing what to think about Frank, asks him to accompany him to Italy to get some more information about Frank. V does not seem to be able to get along very well with Frank, to which his son replies by telling Vito that Frank is an evil man. Then it happens that Frank's girlfriend (Gina De Niro) is in the same house as Vito, but she does not appear to care much about him. Vittorio (Tommy Lee Jones), Vito's brother, is a very violent and nasty man, but Vito thinks that he is just a bit over-protective. The three go to Italy for a week and Vito gets a chance to meet his father again, which he does not enjoy at all. The movie also stars Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Vincent Price, Marcello

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie because it's about a guy who is on a journey. He is on the path of life because of a girl, who is his inspiration to become a successful artist. It's a funny movie. It has an old man who gets his name from a "J. L. Matson" type of story line. It does it well. The acting is good, but the story line gets old after the first few scenes. But this is a good comedy. It gives the audience a laugh. It even has a cute little old man. The story line is also about a girl who's a little girl, but in a nice way. She is always happy and nice, but not too little. The comedy is really funny, but it can get boring towards the end of the movie. You have a nice little scene between the two old guys. I like this. The movie has a good pace. It never really gets boring, but there are a few scenes that are repetitive, but you can't really get tired of them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit that I didn't see it on my first visit here. But this one was actually a decent movie. I loved it.   Like most of them, the movie has it's own setting, but the movie's most interesting aspects are the people in it. The movie is very well thought out, very well acted, and has it it's humour. This film is a masterpiece, a movie that will not be forgotten for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A man on a mission in a white coat. A man who wants to save a man who is helpless, yet he knows his mission is to save the boy. He is also a man to whom the girl, the girl's mother, trusts and believes, even when he's hiding and trying to convince himself to help her. He knows she'll love him once he gives her the opportunity to make a choice.   The main male role is a bit of a stereotypical one, but it has a good enough reason: he is a man in a hurry who is not afraid to trust a woman to help him in his search. And that's why he gets the girl.  In an alternative reality, a young girl in the present day, lives with her father, a successful businessman, who is also her grandfather's doctor. But when her father was murdered by the mafia, her mother and brother went into hiding. And now, the mother is pregnant, and the brother has died, while her father is also in hiding.  The first scene was good: the young girl was crying while she was watching her grandfather die, and she did not know what was going to happen to her and her mother when her grandfather died. She also did not believe in herself and in others. But once she sees her father alive, she believes. The second scene was very good: a police officer came and arrested the man, and gave her some information about him. But, he has a very important message for the girl: she must help a stranger with a gun, and he is her grandfather. The girl believes, and does everything that she can to help the stranger, even if it means she must run away from her family, the family that has trusted and believed in her for all her life. This is the whole movie: a good, if stereotypical, action movie with a girl who has a special mission, and a woman who believes in her and does things for the good of her and others.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best part of the movie are the little conversations between the characters and it's great to see how the people are different.   It's a nice change to see what a real person has to say about what they see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is very different from the traditional anime style of the 80s and 90s and that is good.   From this movie it seems they made it to be a comedy that is actually very funny and very exciting and it has one of the best female leads of any anime ever.  Also, it has lots of really good action scenes.  You should try this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new favorite from our film group is " The Good Soldier " about the story of a soldier named David who does not understand how to be a good man.   We are introduced to David's sister, Emily.  When David is asked to come in to visit her, his mother tells him that he is not a good soldier.  David is not to be trusted.  The Good Shepherd is an old fashioned film that tells the story about a man that is a good and good looking man and a good good soldier, but he has a problem, an emotional problem.  He has a very big emotional problem and it affects all he does.  One of his friends is also a good looking and a decent soldier but he is also an emotional pain in his life.  It is easy to watch this film, a true story that is told in a classic movie style. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie I was very pleased with the way that it was handled by the filmmakers. This movie deals with the relationship between a mother and daughter who are separated and can't be in the same room with each other because they live in different states. This is a movie about growing up and the way the kids deal with their new found differences. The movie is about friendship, acceptance and making friends. It has a good feel to it.   It was directed by Scott Cooper and starred Jeff Bridges, Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Carradine. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the "The Golden Compass" yet so I'll just say I'll definitely be watching this one. I'm not too impressed with the film so far. The acting is okay, it's not great but it is passable. The story is somewhat repetitive, a bit boring and I find it a little difficult to get interested in. There are plenty of scenes where people die in a dramatic fashion and that's about it. In regards to the story I wouldn't describe it as "uninteresting". That was my experience. It has enough mystery to keep me interested but it lacks much of anything else. I am looking forward to seeing more of these stories from the kids in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise is good, but the execution is not.   It has some good things going for it: a nice setting, a good story and even a funny and memorable song by a good song writer.  Unfortunately, it is too weak to even reach the first two goals. The characters are good enough to make you believe they could do things right. But they lack the depth and depth needed to really be believable characters.  It takes a little longer to get to know them and even longer to see that they are not that great.  The humor is not that funny either.  They try to use humor to give you a little emotional impact. It works sometimes, but it is never that funny or that good.  There are some very good action scenes with plenty of twists and turns and nice camera work.  But overall, this movie falls far short of expectations.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot of The Fifth Element is simple. Five scientists are sent to a planet called Valtos IV to do research. The planet, which is ruled by a dictator named The Benefactor, is covered in a layer of pure energy that can only be seen by a special telescope. To protect the planet's inhabitants from the planet destroying energy, The Benefactor plans on transferring the energy to Earth. His assistant, Dr. Zorg, has just gotten back from the moon where he discovered the "miracle of life" called the "Pulse." He travels back in time to get a pulse from Earth's energy and bring it back with him to Valtosaurs IV. Zorro (a character who appears later on in the story) is ordered to find and stop Zorg. He gets a message from Zorg which leads him to Zorg's former professor who has become a vampire. He kills Zorg and the scientist's body is dumped in a pit of maggots. The Fifth Man, a scientist who lives on the planet Valto, is now the new leader of Valtosaurus IV. He is assisted by a young woman named Valeria (Valerie Stonem) who is the daughter of an old professor. Together, they must help Zorg stop the Benefactor. The story of The Five Men is very well done and is about the characters that the movie makes you feel sorry for. When you see how a person like Valeria must look at the others in her life and how she must feel when she is separated from her father it all makes you sympathize with the character of Valeria. We all wish that our loved ones would love us in spite of the fact that we do things to hurt them. We feel sorry that they live in such a horrible and painful situation. However, it's not so bad, it is just a bad situation. The film is a combination of action and science fiction. The only thing I would like to see changed is the ending. When The Benefacine tells Zorg that he has made a choice, I thought that it was going to be a good ending, but it seemed to drag on and on. If it is possible I would be willing to watch The Fifth Earth again, I just wish that the final scene was a bit more good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The whole movie is so well done, you really can't put a finger on why you're so captivated by it.   It was like watching a documentary of what is really going on when things go wrong at the atomic plant, with all these very real people who go through the same experiences, who have no hope that things will ever get any better, but who go on, fighting until it's too late, because the cost to them is too great.  It is a very sad and dark story and if it wasn't for the fact that it is so gripping, I might be bored by it even more than I am now, but that is the nature of a good mystery.  This movie really took me away:      I found myself thinking, 'Is there really something wrong with this movie?'   This movie is a mystery, but at the same time, it has so many things going for it that there is really no real answer as to why you should be watching this, but one thing I really noticed was that all the characters were so realistic and there were no obvious stereotypes.  I think that if a film could do that, I think it would be a great one.

It's a little different, it's not the kind of comedy you've seen in a few comedies but this one has a little more emotion. It also has a lot of action and you get a taste of the movie in the first act and the ending. The movie had a few flaws but it was pretty good. It was kind of like "The Hangover" on steroids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've just watched "Ripley's Believe It or Not." The movie is about a little girl with a little sister that has been diagnosed with leukemia. The little sister grows up a little slow, but we see a lot of the life of the little girl. It's great to see a little kid. We get to see her take a nap, run around, etc. We also see how her sister reacts to her illness. There's a lot to like about the movie and we see how Ripley believes Ripley's story even though she doesn't see things the way Ripley does. It is a good little movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good story about a girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was a decent movie, not great, but decent. I enjoyed the characters. They weren't super likable, but not bad. They were likable. I do not know why they never had a TV series and why the characters never met each other on TV. Perhaps because that would have been a waste of time, and it would have made more sense to meet the characters in real life, not in a movie. The bad is that the ending is not what I would have wanted. I didn't like the characters at all, and didn't want them to be together in any way. It seemed that the writers were a little frustrated by how the plot was working. They may have felt that the movie didn't need to have all of the characters together for it to have a good ending. I was glad they left it out of the final movie though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In many ways, it's a really solid horror movie.   It's scary, it has some excellent scares, and it's really well acted.  In fact, it was actually the most enjoyable movie I've seen in a while.  As for the scares: there were many to be found, and some of them really surprised me.  One particular scene was especially unnerving.  It had me so scared that I wanted to run back to my room and lie in bed until the sun came up again.  If you're a horror movie fan, you'll definitely like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a good old Hollywood thriller, that uses a lot of the familiar tropes (the old gaudy costumes, the old actors, the big guns, the good guy gets the girl). It's a little too long for my taste, but it's good enough for a horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very well-made movie.     It is a good example of the kind of movies that are made now.  It is one of those movies where everything seems to be working and the action scenes are awesome.  The movie is about a group of boys that go to a camp to play hockey and all the boys are good-looking guys and all good-hearted and love to play their hockey.  I am pretty sure that the main problem is that the actors are all in the wrong place at the wrong time and it all gets a bit ridiculous, but it doesn't matter because everyone is good looking and the movie gets a good laugh out of it.  This movie makes you feel really good and it makes you think about what would happen in a school with all those boys who are good looking, like good boys in general, and it gives you a really good feeling and makes you want to go to the gym and go play hockey.       There is a lot of action in this movie, a lot.  They play a game of hockey during a snowstorm, it turns out to be a game for real, and the whole movie is a hockey game.  There are hockey uniforms and then the uniforms have to be changed every time there is a goal because there are only so many ways to put together a hockey uniform, and they have to change all of them at the same time.  Then the goal is scored and the team has to play another game. When the team is playing a game at night, the whole gang comes out of their dressing room looking like they are on a hockey team and they are all really nice guys and they don't think about much else except to play the game. After one of the goals, the rest of the guys, who are looking like normal guys, come back in their pajamas and play some hockey games.  When the movie was playing in the theater, I saw an old guy on the other side of the audience who was wearing a hockey sweater.  After one game, when the guys come out again, they are wearing hockey uniforms.  One of the boys says that he is going to get a tattoo of the big blue eagle on his back.  Later that night, they get to the arena and it is playing hockey. When they come out and play another night, there are a lot more guys, even though they don\'t play much more, and some are really good-
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a pretty big fan of horror films, and this movie is great. There are some scenes that have you totally scared, and there are others that are very unsettling and creepy.   It doesn't take long for the movie to get to it's most chilling scene, but it still never gets too confusing.  It's very scary.  I had a hard time watching this movie for many hours because I couldn't get past the scenes where people died.  My mom, dad and sister are a little older than my sisters, and I'm pretty sure they've had a better time than I have (probably not much more fun than I did). I'm not sure how much I'm supposed to take from this movie.  As a fan of all sorts of horror movies, I will most certainly watch this movie again.

The cast is great with a good balance of men and women. I was very impressed with the quality of the acting, particularly by the two leads. It's an unusual story about a cowboy and his wife, but they both are really great and interesting characters. My wife and I would love to sit down and watch it over and over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a fantastic movie.   In fact, it would be a great movie on it's own, even without the sequels.  And while they do use some cliches to get the message across, it really is the truth that is the point and the way it is told is amazing.  I love movies like this.   The story is really not that interesting.  Sure, it is supposed to be about a poor girl who falls in love with a rich boy.  But I found that story interesting only because of the character of the rich boy, the kind of boy who never gives up on a girl no matter what obstacles are in his way.  The poor girl's love story is just as interesting. And, as mentioned above, it's told in the style of a comic strip.  In this comic strip style, there are many different characters.  Sometimes there are just one or two characters. Sometimes there is a whole group.  Most of the time, these characters are just very good characters, who are trying to do good.  At other times, these people are just bad people trying to get away with evil.  It does get old.  There is a lot of back and forth.  People are sometimes bad, other times good. But the more they fight each other and the better they fight, the more real the story becomes.  Eventually, the poor girl starts to fall for the rich kid.  However, there is more to it than that.  She falls in because she can't help herself and her parents won't let her.  They just won't do it.  For a while there is some real romance in this movie. But it soon wanes.  What I would love to see in a movie about love between a poor boy and a rich girl would be some real emotion.  Would there be any real pain in the guy's heart?  I don't know.  Because I didn't find any.  He would act like he is always laughing.  Is he really?  I had a feeling that this movie would have been so much better if it had not been made into a cartoon movie. I was really shocked when I saw that this is an animated movie. In fact the animation in this film is the real star of this movie, in a bad way. As mentioned, this movie was really funny.  Some of the funny moments are just too silly to really
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi or horror, but this movie was surprisingly good, and it has a nice mix of the two genres.   It's set in a post-apocalyptic future, where the world has become a kind of super-dystopian dystopia, and everyone lives in a single, giant dome that was made to protect the people from the "evil" aliens that live below.  The people were divided into different factions; the ones who live in the dome are called "slavers" because of their lifestyle of feeding off the Earth.  Their only hope is the "re-civilization" that is about to happen.  We get the best of both worlds here; the people of the dome live in a utopia and are never troubled by aliens.  However, the evil aliens keep invading the dome, and eventually they make a new colony, that's based in a very familiar place: a world that's almost the same as our own.  There's only one difference.  After a few centuries of their "reconciliation," the evil alien race gives the people a new world to live in.  People are no longer slaves, and the people are free to do what they like in the new world.  All is well, and all is good, until an evil alien starts to build a giant army of "militants" to invade the dome and conquer it for itself.  As always, the bad guys are always the same: their leaders are either mad or crazy, or they're both of the same kind, and they have some kind of brainwashing device.  One of them is a young girl, who's so obsessed with fighting and killing that she's willing to kill just about everyone she meets.  A group of women are also "miliants," and they also have an obsession with fighting.  I don't know what it's like for the other people living in the Dome, but for me the movie was well-paced and was interesting enough to keep my interest.  This is a good thriller, and a nice change of pace from the usual dystopian sci-fie.

This was a lot of fun and I will be ordering it for the whole family to watch. I love how they put the movie together. I was a bit worried that this would be a pretty ordinary movie as I could easily imagine a little girl telling her grandfather that a man and a woman want to marry her and they have the money and it's all going to be fun and it all goes to the bank. But I am so pleased with the movie that I will definitely be watching it again in the near future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is like a love story between a man and a pig. If you're a vegetarian who is also a woman and likes the movies that depict how great and intelligent animals are, this movie is the kind of movie for you. It is a comedy about a man named Ben and his pig Ben. The film shows us what happens when a man like this gets married. Now if you don't like women and the movie's story, then this is the movie for that. Now before I go on to say what I liked about this movie, let me say this. When I first saw this movie I thought it was about a guy named Ben who has a wife who thinks that he is gay and he gets angry and tries to kill his wife. It's not the case of a gay man who tries to murder his wife, it's Ben, his wife and their pig Ben trying to kill each other. It was a good comedy that I enjoyed seeing.

The story was good, I liked how it felt like a western but I do not think it could be in 3rd grade. It had many cool gun fights, the villain was a cool guy, I like how the movie ended, there was a big fight, the climax was good and all. I liked the cast too. They were all different from each other, and they all felt like characters to me. I like the cast in this movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:      This is a well-produced film. The story has an emotional punch that you don't often get in a movie made to be a children's picture.   The story starts with a boy and girl, who are being chased by a giant monster in their house.  The monster is called 'The Big-Foot' and it attacks every day until it finally gets through to them.  It is actually a rather funny monster.  He has to be caught once a year in order to keep the monster from destroying their village, but the boy can't get into his room fast enough, and the monster does a pretty good job of making him go through a lot of trouble.  However, the girl, after being captured by the monster, is put into a sort of sleep chamber with a bunch of other kids in order that she can stay in a'sleep'.  The other kids are very funny and likable, so they are not taken too seriously when the monster tries to kill them, and they manage to get through without a hitch.  This is one of the best movie ever made, and it makes you want to see what else the director has in store for us in the future.

The only thing I like about it is how fucking funny it is, and the plot is pretty good.    It was really hard to decide which one to like better, the movie or the music, because both are really good.   The movie's story is about a woman named Maria who just got released from prison, and she's been trying to make money so she can pay off her debts and go on vacation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been watching this movie for the past 6 years. It's still not available for the masses and it's not like the movie is a bad one. The art is really good. The music is good as well. The characters are all interesting and I enjoy them all. One thing I think the movie could have done is added a little more time for the plot to unfold. This movie should have been 2 hours long.   In a world ruled by the "Vietnamese" and by the military they fight each other with a knife. The fighting is fierce and the men lose their lives. In this world, the "Angkor" is sacred and cannot be explored by outsiders. Only the most devoted members of the military, soldiers and monks, can have access to it. One day a group of soldiers, belonging to a military academy, are in a hut where they have a meditation session. Suddenly one of them sees a man in a white robe. He takes off his hood and says "I am Angkor Wat". A man who was a student in the school that taught him the secrets of Angknor Wat comes out of the hut. He tells the group that Angkandas are only myth and are nothing but legends. He says that it is only through prayer that one can find one's way into the Temple. He teaches the soldiers how to pray. The three monks are shocked but the soldiers are excited and the mood in the hut is good. Then the man in the white robe begins to teach them about religion. The first person to enter the temple is an old man, who is holding an altar and wearing robes of gold. When he enters the temple he sees a statue of Buddha, that looks exactly like his father. The old man has a very strong desire to become a Buddha and to see his father again. One night when the old man is having a dream he comes across the Buddha. The Buddha asks the old, what would he do if he were to have one wish. The Old Man says, "I would make Angkour a temple for Buddhists only" the Buddha then tells the old that if this wish is fulfilled then he will allow him to become the first king of Angka. Then it turns out that the Buddha's dream is real. The Three Brothers are the first ones to enter Angktor Wat. The oldest Brother is not able to enter and is imprisoned in a cave. The youngest Brother,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, here I am going to start off a review that was supposed to be positive.   There were not a lot of things good about the movie.  But I have to give credit where credit is due.  They tried to make this movie as realistic as possible.  The acting was pretty good.  I thought it was very interesting to see a character like the police captain.  It was a little hard to follow the character because there were many lines of dialogue that were not understandable.  You had to rely on the subtitles to understand some of the dialogue.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the villain.  His character was a caricature of what the villain is supposed to look like.  There was no sense of danger or menace.  To me, the movie was a failure.  This movie was pretty much a parody of horror movies.  A man watches the night-shift detective perform at the hospital where he is a patient.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You may find yourself in need of a pick-me-up in between the tears, or perhaps you're just looking to pass the time. The main character has some seriously messed up past, the movie explores it. And yet, despite the horrors, there's still a sense of hope at the end of the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of the '50s TV series 'The Prisoner', and this movie is just an even better version of that show, not to mention a wonderful story, well told and beautifully acted, and a hell of a watch for a long while.    The Prisoner is about a young girl who is being forced to join the army, but when she discovers that she has been recruited to kill people and then eat their hearts (because of the way the soldiers are programmed), she refuses and instead tries to make her way back to the States with the help of a couple of others (mostly older people who she does not like) who are also trying to go home.  In the beginning, it's all well handled, but by the middle, the story has become really ridiculous, and by the end, it turns into a parody of the entire show, with a few amusing moments thrown in.  Although there is a lot of swearing, it is never uncouth or inappropriate, and most of it is in good taste.  The dialogue, which was written by a real-life person, is actually very well done, and there is also some real heart to the characters, particularly the younger ones.  This movie is one of those movies that is easy to love, to hate, and also to love to hate.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say that the movie itself is terrible, I enjoyed it a lot! I'm sure many others who like horror movies will enjoy it too. It was one of those things that just happened that this movie was like a "Halloween" movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am glad I took a chance and watched this one. It is a bit like the movie The Matrix. But the main character is a great guy. The ending was a bit cheesy, and the ending of the movie seemed like a joke.   The plot for the movie is that a woman is trying to get a man to change his behavior and do the right thing. She tells him that if he really wants to change, he needs to take a good hard look at himself. She wants him to look at what he has become. She then tells him it will not be a good thing for him, but she wants to go home with him and talk. That's it.  After a few days they get in a taxi and drive to a beautiful resort. There they have sex and talk a lot, until the woman gets tired and they walk off together.  The next day she tells him the truth about herself. She says she wants nothing more than to be with him again. But she knows that this time he will not change. He has fallen so far, that there is no hope. I guess this movie has a message about love and acceptance for who we are.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky enough to see this film during the last weekend of my college tour. It was during one of those nights where you think, 'If only I had a dollar for every time a stranger made fun of me...' Well, the film didn't disappoint. It's a simple but effective little flick.   The actors are pretty good and they're allowed to really stretch out the scenes to play the more serious,'man's man' type roles in the film. The characters are good.  The story isn't much of anything special. The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a small group of survivors live off the land. The two main characters are the lead characters, a 'dumb man' and a 'beautiful woman'.   As far as the 'plot' goes, this film really only works as a parody. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie.    A good buddy comedy that's not pretentious and funny and really about the friendship between these two young men and their friendship.  For a film that's about a "buddy" comedy, I really feel like this one was about a brother-sister duo.  My two faves from this movie are Kevin Conroy (as Kevin) and Tommy Lee Jones as the younger Kevin's dad.  This movie will always stay with me and never go away. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure this is a good or a bad movie. It's probably both.   As far as the movie itself goes, I didn't love it, but it's a good story that has some nice elements in it.  For the most part it is just the basic set up of the story: the main characters are a couple of poor drunks who get together to steal food, drink, and drugs. The basic premise of the movie is a little stale. There isn't anything really new going on, and it feels like the plot is just repeating itself again and again, like there isn't much to it, and that's what a lot of the characters really complain about, too.  There are some nice parts to it. It features a bit of sex and a few good lines and things like that.  I was glad to see that the lead character in the movie wasn't too pathetic, and the music in the background was very good.  Overall, this wasn't a bad film. It was just a little dull.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This is the film that broke the mold of sci-fi comedy. Now, it is my opinion that any Sci-Fi film needs to include a good laugh. When that laughter is good, it really is a good thing.   The plot of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' is simply one of many of the kind in sci-Fi movies of the late 20th Century.  However, it adds a certain extra bit of comedy for those who are old enough to appreciate.  " I enjoyed this film very much. The humor was pretty good. The acting was good too. The only one thing I would have to say about this is that I think it could have used more of the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This movie has everything it takes to make a great horror movie.   The acting is superb, especially in the first half of the film.  From the very first moment the camera shows us a creepy old lady and her three cats.  The movie is set in a house where three creepy elderly women lived.  When the women died their ghosts came back to take possession of their daughters.  Each woman has their own story and each woman has her own secrets.  This movie is filled with a little too many creepy ghost stories, but the movie never over comes the little to no tension.  My biggest problem with the movie is that it does not have a real ending.  A quick cut scene shows us one of the women trying to take a photo of herself with a camera.  Then it cuts to a close up of a dead cat and a dead mouse laying around.  I'm sure the cat had a little trouble being alive because it's head looked so heavy.  Once again this movie seems to have a story about ghosts and animals that it wants to tell.  It has many ghosts that you see and I'm pretty sure they are all part of the three sisters' family.  What really scared me though was the ghost of the mother.  She has a really disturbing personality and seems to really enjoy messing with people.  There were a few parts where I thought this movie may have been a little over rated because of all the creepy old women that haunt it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've just watched the final season of This Is Spinal Tap   with my father. We were all about 15 and had only watched two episodes so far, but I found myself liking it a lot. The plot revolves around Paul Newman and his band The Spinal Shaft . They are going to a big festival and Paul gets a date with a young girl. The Spinals get kicked out of the festival by the bouncers and Paul ends up in a big fight with the bouncer, Mr. Love , and his gang. Paul is almost knocked out, and ends up taking a punch from the other guy, and falls down into a pool of blood.   As the story goes on, we learn that the bouncier's son is being raised by a hippie couple who have a baby girl, who is named Mary. There are other characters introduced, but they don't get too much screen time.  One of the main characters of this show is Paul Newman ., he's a huge character and his character is pretty much one big joke. He's always trying to be funny but he never quite comes up with a good one. I would have liked to see a bit more from him, as he's the one who does most of the funny things with the Spinals.  It takes awhile for Paul to get going, but once he does, you know you're in for a good time. Some of the other characters are hilarious, such as the hippies, the police officers, and Mr. L  es, which is probably his most memorable role.  Paul Newman is always funny and his acting is spot on. I like the fact that he can come off as such a goofball, which makes him easier to relate to.  I thought the music in this show was okay, but not fantastic. There are some pretty good rock songs that are played, but this show has a bit too much of a "Saturday Night Fever" feel to it. It doesn't really stick in your head, and I guess that's part of the appeal. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to this film because it was one of the few films that dealt with real life issues with a good twist. This is a true story from the life of an actual child of a serial killer who was the inspiration behind this movie. The film is a little long at an average of 90 minutes but still worth seeing. It is a dark comedy about a kid who is on a trip to visit his grandfather in the woods, who was an actual serial killer and was not caught until after his death. He is brought to a town where it is assumed he is just a normal kid who just has an odd fascination with serial killers. He then decides to kill a couple of serial killers who seem a little too tame for such a twisted killer, even though the movie is set in the 1970s. He does however kill all the victims while they sleep, and it is a very dark film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As much as I love movies of this genre, there are some that, to me at least, are not really about the movie. I like to watch movies that just show us what it's like to be around an older person. It's pretty simple really, the characters are usually the same. Sometimes they even seem to be the same, which is weird to me because I can relate to them quite a bit.   I have always liked the movies of Stanley Kubrick, but I've never understood why people don't like them. Kubrick's films have always been great, I remember seeing "A Clockwork Orange" in the early 90's when I was 11 years old and it blew me away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One day when I was little my mother and I were visiting friends in the United States. As we went up the steps we were greeted by a large, manly man with a huge biker's head and leather jacket. His name was Jack, and we were immediately taken in by his appearance. He carried a huge bullwhip around his shoulders and was riding a Harley Davidson in a huge park. Jack and I got to talking and he began telling me stories about growing up in the old country and being a biker.   When he was a young man and looking for an adventure, he went out and found the Hell's Angels. He joined the gang and they gave him the chance to prove that he was the man.  It was an interesting and scary experience, but after a while he became tired of it and joined a rival gang called the Hells Angels. After his gang got kicked out by the Hellers, Jack found himself out on his own.  He was homeless and lived by a road and was never sure what he'd do with his life. When he saw a truck, he said "This could be the ticket"   This was the first movie to have a motorcycle chase.  As Jack got closer to his target, the truck started up and out of the woods Jack pulled his motorcycle over.  A man with long white hair dressed all in black in a black suit, black boots and a white shirt was in the back of the truck, and he was armed.  The next thing Jack knew, a bullet was through his chest and the man with the long hair was pointing a pistol at him.  Jack got his hands up, got the gun out and started shooting.  We are all familiar with the motorcycle chase, and the fact that Jack drove right up to the man's truck without being noticed is a fact we all remember.  If you have seen movies about motorcycle races (the movie, not the sport) you know the story.  One of the things you also realize is that in this particular scene, Jack was very lucky that the man didn't have a gun and was too distracted by the truck to shoot.  This is an important lesson in life: Never get too close to a gun.  After Jack was killed, we are told that there was no blood in the truck.  When the man in the suit showed up at Jack's funeral he told his mother that the bullet had gone right through his heart and

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was initially concerned about this movie, seeing as it has the typical bad reviews that you see about a bad movie. Then I watched it. I have no idea why, I watched a good bad movie, but it was still a good film. It is probably not what you think it is going to be, but I am not the kind of person that will write anything negative about a movie just because I don't think it was the best. I love the characters and the movie is funny. This movie is not for everyone, and I am sure most people will hate the ending. I like the ending, it is really good and unexpected. I am giving it an 8/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie recently and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The story is well told, the acting is quite good and the movie was very funny.   The movie starts with a great shot of the clouds in the sky and then the film begins.  The story about the first person in a world without people starts to get quite boring and then it is changed into a story about a world with a human society. It is a bit confusing at times, but it is well done.  It is nice to see a human character (John Wayne) who is not an action hero.  There is a strong romance between John Wayne and his partner, Eva, that is well played by the actresses and the music is pretty good as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been wanting to see a good western ever since I saw the original western in the theaters.   The reason this movie is good is that it has a few laughs while it plays the western.  The pacing is pretty good.  They tell you what to expect from the beginning of the movie, and when you finally get to see the action the pacing slows down and lets you experience the action.  If you are a western fan this is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title is probably my favourite movie title of all time. It's a movie that has the feeling of a movie you'd see in a movie theater. It has a slow paced story. It takes place over a series of episodes which is nice, especially for a movie with a slow pace, which keeps things slow enough to let things linger. The film is great, I like all of the actors and they do a good job portraying the characters, with great voices (even the kids) and great chemistry. It is very easy to get into with only a few laughs and even easier to stop when you have a great film.   This movie is like a great short film with a bunch of great actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would go out of my way to give this a high recommendation.   The only thing I dislike about this movie is that it doesn't give the impression that it takes place in the future.  That is, there is a future. But you're not living in the past.  In other words, this isn't a Sci-Fi movie. It has a certain feel of a Western. There are also a few scenes that have some kind of weirdness going on that are not explained.  But if you're an old fashioned Western fan, you're gonna like this movie.  It's got some great scenes.  If you're a fan of westerns or just want to watch a little bit of history, then you're in for a real treat.  I recommend this movie to all fans of western movies.

Some people don't like the way it's told but it's good.   The story is all about a man, John (Michael Pitt) who was a good man who got into a little accident with his car. He doesn't seem to care that much about life anymore. He lives his life by himself. John just can't seem help himself and he is having lots of problems. He gets a call from his wife about a trip to Chicago. She wants him to go with her but he refuses. John leaves his car and decides to go. The trip takes up a lot of time. John is not very good at talking to people. When the guy who drives John to Chicago shows up it gets bad. He's always having an attitude, being moody, being angry. But this time he seems to be a little more depressed than usual. He knows that he's not in the best place in life but he still has a little life in him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good film. If you enjoy movies that are more about human beings, you will like it. If human characters are likeable, so are the humans. There is no dialogue in this film. You have to listen to the film. I don't think the film is a classic. But it is a decent film. There are a few weak links. The story is a little over-long and takes a little too long to get to the point. You could have gone straight to the last scene. There could have been a little more emphasis on the other characters in the film, because I am not sure they all know their place. I think it could have added to the atmosphere a little bit. But this is a solid little film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good comedy with a good story about the most hated man in America. I like the ending. - July 23, 2010good movie  Reviewer: Anonymous - favorite favorite favorite - May 8, 2010  Subject: It's a good flick and funny, but.... I was expecting a bit more. I thought it would be a "good" flick because it's good, funny, and has a bit of plot development. What I get is a lot of people talking about how the police are going to arrest the evil guy that's been causing a lot trouble and all the people are going crazy over it. But the movie doesn't do much with that plot and it's only about 10 minutes long. I wouldn't mind if it ended there. I would like the movie to have a bit less humor. The movie seems to be about how people react to being hated on and I like that but it gets stale after about 10 or 15 minutes of that. Other than that, I like it. I didn't mind the humor much, it's a fun movie. A good one at that. - May 25, 2010It's a Good Film, but..  Reply to this review - May 15, 2010I found this to be a good idea and interesting to watch. However, it would have been much better had the movie ended a bit before it did. For example, I liked the "towel flings" scene, it was funny, if only the movie had a bit shorter. I liked it, but I wish the movie could have gone a bit longer to get the story a bit deeper. I also really enjoyed the "worries about what people will think of me" scene. However that was also funny, except for the fact that the guy who is so hated in America couldn't have been more annoying. I mean, he can't believe that people would be so mean about him (not that he has to make a fuss about it) and when people are mad at him he just laughs and then walks off. I think that kind of scene would be fun if the movie didn't end so quickly. In general, it wasn't bad, I just wish there would have had more to the plot. The ending was good though! - May 2, 2010The end was so predictable it was really good  Crazy good movie, but... This was pretty good. I felt like it was over pretty quickly. It's not bad

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing I saw of this movie was a group of cops, one of them was a gay guy, who had a crush on the straight guy, and he was the kind of guy who would give a blow job to anyone who asked.  He was an attractive, handsome man.  The film is based on a true story about a group called the 'Gaystapo' which were the thugs that guarded St. Sebastian's Palace in the gayborhood of Paris.   It's a little hard to follow along but at the same time it's not too hard to understand what's going on.  If this movie made a movie about a gang of guys being all gay, the plot would be laughable, but it's a lot more complicated than that.  I can understand what these guys were doing, they had a grudge against a local mob boss that they wanted to kill, and if this were a movie from today the film would've just been a bunch of guys getting high and having sex, but they were not going to get away without a fight.  In a way this is the first real gay movie that we have seen since the 90s.  And that's a good thing.  These guys are not just sex maniacs, they also hate the police, which is understandable considering all the hate these guys had for the police in real life.  Also the music in this film is really nice.  At the end of the movie when a group from the Gaystapo shows up to arrest the mob boss, the mob bosses wife is on the wrong side of a gun and she is shot in the head, and it is the end.  While this movie has a few bad parts, the movie does have some very good parts.  This movie is also funny, the gang of gay guys in the film do have a lot of attitude, and while the movie is about gangs of gay thugs being tough guys, it does have a strong group of gay male characters in this movie, and the movie never does make fun of any of the gay male stereotypes.  It makes fun of the cops, and also the gang leader, but the only bad part I had with this movie is the ending.  There's a bunch more good stuff in this book, and I recommend it to all the gay guys out there who love a good, rough and tumble gangster movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an interesting film, that I feel is not so much the work of a master film maker, as it is more the product of his audience. The movie has the appearance of being made by a professional film maker of a lesser calibre.   The movie is the work not of a pro but a novice, but the novice takes all the movie has to offer to the best of his ability.  To an audience familiar with classic films like "Cinderella", "The Wizard of Oz" and "Snow White", this movie seems to have little to do with these classic stories.  A lot of the movie, which the audience expects to be an adventure, is presented as a mystery.  The plot is a little confusing and lacks a certain momentum and a clear line of the characters through the story.  This movie is a good lesson in filmmaking.  I will certainly revisit this movie as I continue to gain a better understanding of the techniques of filmmaking.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great thriller.   It is good for action, for comedy, and for a really good suspense movie.  This is a great movie and is probably one of the best action movies   I have seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film of international, romantic, comedy, musical and melodramatic proportions, written and directed by a renowned Hollywood director and actor. All the actors are extremely gifted, and all the scenes are great.   In terms of art, the film has a great feel to it. The colors and colors of this film are very appealing to the eye and the colors in this film blend very nicely into one another, and make you feel as if you are viewing a movie on a large screen in a big hall. This is a picture that I can say is beautiful in the way it captures the feeling of what it is to be a person and what life is like, all with the grace and gracefulness of a ballet dancer.  It has the power to move me, and in order to do that it takes a few minutes to get into. The characters are very well portrayed, and you feel sorry for all of the people involved.  This is an amazing film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (2/10)   The movie is all about a guy that gets a job at the local hotel. The only problem is he lives in a fantasy world and his best friend is a fairy. The fairy shows him around and introduces him to a few people, including a girl, who appears to be a real fairy. As this guy and the girl get to know each other he learns she is really a demon and they have to team up to stop the fairy. When they do this they discover he is not a real demon but has an evil twin. The movie has a lot of laughs, but the story isn't all that good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie "I'm Not There" is an interesting film about a man who has gone through a very traumatic experience in life. He had a car crash, suffered several other injuries and in his attempts to get his life back on track he found it very difficult. In his attempts he also became a recluse and became obsessed with a woman who he met while hitch hiking through the Rockies. The story is about a woman being attracted to the recluse, the woman in turn becomes attracted to him and it is through these events that the two characters end up coming together.   A great film from a good director. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is good enough. The acting is good but not quite great. The story, and plot, is decent but not good. I think it would have been better if a bit more had been shown, like a bit about the war, and about the people at the camp. But this is a decent war movie for the most part.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (   )   In my opinion the first time you are introduced to "The One Ring", you already know that it is going to be one of the most legendary fantasy movies that is currently being made. You know that when "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" came out the fantasy genre was about to receive a shot in the arm.   The production value is superb, and the actors are really well cast, you will be surprised at just how many interesting characters this film has to offer. The voice acting is also of high standard and you can't help but enjoy the movie. I've never seen a movie that makes you wonder how it all began. It is a unique adventure that will leave you breathless at times, and leave you laughing the rest of the time.  If you are looking for a great movie that has a sense of humor and just plain good stories then "The Return of the King" might just be your movie.  It was fun to see a film that has so much personality and not all the characters are bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First I want to say I am very thankful to the author. I have watched the film multiple times and I like how different the way the movie is portrayed is from the books. For a movie you could get a movie at anytime and still have a nice plot that's worth watching. I think the author used many of the same actors as the books in this movie and it was very good and you could feel the love between the two characters that would not feel the same with just any movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For me, this is a movie that does everything right. From the way it begins to the way the story is set up, it does exactly what it is supposed to do. The movie begins with a girl named Yuki who is working as a waitress in a Tokyo coffee shop. A guy named Takeo, who is very handsome, is an expert in dating and knows a lot about women. The two strike up a friendship. The more the two are together, the more Yuki has to work to stay out of trouble. There are some nice twists and turns to keep the story entertaining for the whole movie. There is a great cast in this movie. The main characters are all excellent, though I think Takeo is a little on the cheesy side. As I was watching this movie, I often wondered if it was the first part of a trilogy. The other two movies that followed had not worked out quite as well. As this movie did, it has a good feel of romance and humor. The music is also very good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always loved horror films but I've never been able to get behind a great movie with good scares. I've seen a lot of good horror films that didn't work and didn't stand the test of time.   One of the reasons why I loved the movie was the way it made you think. The camera was in close up, and if you look closely, you can see that a man (the main character) was dead at the end of the movie. I didn't mind it being scary, but I think a good scare can do you a lot more good than bad. The actors did a nice job as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was absolutely perfect. It was the perfect mixture of thriller and comedy. It's so well made, that I was wondering what could have been. There is a very good storyline going on. I don't really know how the movie would have ended without a good love triangle that is very well acted. If you like action-packed thrillers, then I am sure you will love this movie.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... 1:05 into the movie, I was thinking, "Why would a grown-up want to go back to high school?" (I guess the answer to that is "because I grew up too.") But then it hit me: a bunch of high school kids in a high school in a country in the late 1950s? I guess it makes sense: there's a real high school here; kids go through years of high-pressure, high-stakes classes; the teachers are really strict; they play a lot of instruments and the class plays a lot; the teacher is a really big deal; and finally, all those high school girls are so horny! (I've seen every movie ever made about high school. And every high school movie has a real, live group of high and sexy, horny college girls; you know who you are!) I guess the first half of the movie is the "class reunion," and the first act is pretty basic stuff, just the girls talking, doing nothing, making jokes. And then the guys show up. And they look like high school guys. And, of course, they're all the hottest.   In one scene, one of the guys, who seems to have been in some kind of drama camp, calls his wife a "sugar titty," and her response? "Yeah, what?"   By the end of the film, you have a bunch high school students on a high-school campus, talking about how sexy it is to be high school and how the teachers were so cool.  A good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched the movie so many times that I don't know what to say about it. It's very hard to describe this movie because everything is a mixture of horror, fantasy, science fiction, and sci-fi. It seems very hard, but that's what you're supposed to feel.   Some people have said that it's a masterpiece and that's true, but you shouldn't let it get you down because that's just the way they do things around here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really love the movie.   The movie is really awesome and it will take you out of a bad movie. The first part where we have to watch a movie with a bunch of people in a hotel room watching a movie is amazing.  The guy in the movie is very funny and the other characters in the room also have great lines.  It is so funny to see how these actors all have different personalities.  It is a great movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I was there." That's what the crowd at the film's opening said after I introduced myself to the movie's two lead characters, Mr. (William) A. Zumwalt (Tom Hanks) and Missy (Melissa Leo). This is a movie with a lot going on, and I mean a lot. You've got a war, and a battle between the North and the South, and an African-American woman in a pretty white hat that can actually talk. There's a romance here, too, but with a man in a wheelchair. But the point of this movie is to get you interested in the movie itself, not the people involved. The romance, at least, is there; I'd like to see that romance developed and explored more, and not just as a one-dimensional love interest, but as the person who falls for the man with the heart of gold. The war here is the Civil War, and the people in the South who fight the Confederate army are fighting not for slavery, or even for the right to keep blacks out of the states (though they probably believed it); they are fighting for a way to survive. And to do that, they have to conquer the American South. Mr. ZUMWALT is an American veteran who fights the Civil-War-era-style Confederate Army. This film is all about his journey into that battlefield to seek revenge against the man who killed his brother. Mr ZUMWORTH, as he is nicknamed by the soldiers, is a man who sees all too clearly where his country is headed. He is willing to risk everything for vengeance; he's not going to sit around and let this country destroy itself. He's a man with a heart of steel. He sees the people of this country killing each other, and he sees that a black man, a fellow with a broken heart, would be a bad man to fight for. His journey is one of revenge and revenge, and revenge has no bounds, no limit.   This is one hell of a movie, but it's a hard one to review. It's very ambitious, very interesting and very well-directed, but the romance and the plot don't really work together, or if they do, they seem a bit out of place. If I ever find myself looking for a good romantic drama (and I hope I never do) this is a good place to start. I do think that Melissa Leo is a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You have to watch this one.   This is one of those classics that just begs to be watched again and again, even after you finish the movie.  In the movie you see a man on a bus, getting on the bus, a guy on a motorcycle comes by, and the man has to tell him how to stop this guy who he has seen in the window of his shop.  And the guy is "Mr. White," who is in need of some work.  The guy has to give the guy some advice.  You see how good the director is.  What I do not like about this movie is when we see the guy on the bike ride up and down the street. I am not kidding when I say this.  That guy is so fast that it is hard to watch, it is like watching a movie on a roller coaster.  This guy is very rude.  He says "I was born in a place like this" and that makes me mad.  When the guy says that he has been born in such and such place, he tells him to go back to that place, then he rides off.  Why do you need to go around in circles in a circle?  So after that, Mr. White tells the bus driver to get to a stop because he is going to get "lucky," and that is the end of the movie,  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a really nice cast (who are all in the film), the characters are well written, and the acting is on point!   It also has a good pace, there is not too many bad things going on, and they do a great job of setting up this movie as a thriller.   And now for the spoiler.    The movie was great.  The way the camera follows the characters around the movie is great, and then when they get to the house they find there is a body in there, and a bloody knife is nearby.  But then they go to a party at the house the next day where people don't have any clue they are actually going to be murdered.  I was really into the movie, I just wanted to go into a bar and see a movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only time I have had good luck with the cast of this movie is when the main one is played by Steve McQueen, the only other character in the movie that could be called a "good" character is the girl that is raped. When I saw Steve Mcqueen, my hopes were set pretty high when I saw him in a movie that was made in the 70s by the great director Alfred Hitchcock.   Mcqueens character is pretty much a "bad boy" who wants revenge. I think that in some ways he is a "normal" man that has to live a very abnormal life to make a living.  After reading a review about the movie I was a bit disappointed in the main character. He seems to be a nice person when he is in his own mind but when he has to face the people that he has made a lot of enemies over the years he becomes pretty "creepy".   I was not surprised at the sex in this movie, in fact it was not that bad.  In a world of horror movies that portray sexuality in a negative light it is very refreshing to see a movie like this, that does not make it the "scary movie".  In my opinion it is a good "action-thriller" that gives you a good time.  I give it an A 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think there's something wrong with me for liking this movie.   The movie is about a young girl who is not really aware that she's pregnant and when she finds out she freaks out.  This is the perfect way to describe what is going on.  As far as I'm concerned this is a comedy with a few laughs, but mostly it's just awful.  The actress who plays the pregnant girl was really horrible.  Not only that, but she's really unattractive.  There's also an older man with a big nose.  If I was the guy that had this girl, I'd put a bullet in his head.  Now, why is she pregnant?   Why would a pregnant girl, who is a normal teenager and doesn't have any kind of problem with her body and doesn...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I loved it!" "I didn't love it at first but I love it now."   The story line is that two guys are in a restaurant after their bachelor party. The waitress tells them they are lucky because it is only two bucks to eat and then the waiter comes in saying the place was not open that day. It's two guys who are looking for a date who have gone to a party at the local bowling alley. There is a girl there named Susan who doesn't know that the guy she is watching is the guy in the video tapes she is playing on. So now she is looking over her shoulder. The camera moves around. She can't figure out who the guy is but she can see that he is pretty good looking. They are sitting at the table and he gets up and walks to a nearby bowling alley where he stops and starts to film himself bowling. He is getting good at it and so is she. Then a guy walks by and then goes back to bowling. So she follows him. He turns to her and says that he has to go because he wants to have another go. Then she sees that he's getting his car out of a ditch. She goes to get a box cutter and he gives it to her. They go back to the table. Then another guy walks over and asks her out. So Susan asks him to play one of his games with her and the guy gets a bit annoyed. They start to argue. He yells at Susan and she goes over to the guy who is throwing a ball to him. The ball misses and hits Susan in the face. Then the guy says, "She really hurt my feelings!" (They were both in a fight over Susan) So Susan walks over to her guy and takes a box cuter from him. So they start to fight again but he stops him and they get into their car and drive off. This all seems pretty normal but then there is a stop sign. There's a car at the stop sign that's stopped for an emergency. So the girl who was standing in front of the stop signs asks the guy to get out and give her a ride. But it's too late! He has his car in the ditch and it's about to sink into the ditch.   So they both decide to jump into the car to help the car. The guy in front has a little bit of trouble but eventually jumps in first. And they both drive off to help.  What

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie, while not that good, is just a very good story.   A woman named Nell (Cate Blanchett) gets hit by a stray bullet at the opening and takes an unfortunate toll on her life.  Nell becomes an alcoholic and her family are forced to leave her and her boyfriend behind, but after two months of a difficult time, Nell finally gets a place of her own.  While there, she gets involved in a case where a man who is a murderer is on the loose.  A few bad people appear after the events, but Nell takes them down in a matter of a couple of hours.  This is a fairly simple story, but the performances are very strong here.  Cate Blainett and Christopher Walken are really excellent and have a few funny moments here and there.  If you like good stories and a good director, then this movie is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie, based on a great book by the same name, is a lot more likeable than it's bookish self. I liked how the two main characters, and the supporting cast, played their role pretty well, although the first half of the movie is quite boring.   It's the other half that makes it enjoyable. The actors did a good job in portraying their characters and their characters are pretty well developed, with a nice story line that unfolds pretty quickly.  In addition to this, it has a good cast of characters, one of which was the main character's daughter, and another that was a "savage", (more like "ruddy") person that got a bit too involved with the main characters.  It was quite good and, again, I enjoyed watching it a lot.  I am looking forward to the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little worried going in. It is a fairly long movie about a group of friends who all hate their jobs at a large company. I felt a little bad for the guy, who is supposed to be a computer specialist. When I learned it was a computer nerd I felt bad about myself. But then, the movie picks up a little in the middle. He starts to work and the boys get a little more comfortable with each other. But they start to get bored with it and eventually they want to make a film. Well, that's when things get interesting.   If you love your computer science and are bored with the big companies and their bullshit, then you'll really enjoy this.  Posted by Scott Johnson at 9:29 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought I'd like a B movie like this one. The music is cheesy, the acting is ridiculous, and the film does not seem to know what to do with any of its various plot elements. It's like an episode of "The Simpsons" (I watched the episode first so I could understand what was going on and now I understand it is not). If you are a B-movie lover, don't bother watching this. If you want to see what B-movies look like, watch a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had heard great things about the new "Halloween" film, and I was really excited to see what Sam Raimi was capable of. I went into this with high hopes and was not disappointed.   It is one of those rare films where you don't care about the characters, the gore and the horror aspect. The story is the story of a high school girl who has an affair with a high ranking government official. I know that sounds like a very generic plot for a horror film, but it's not. The movie has a very well-rounded cast, with a few minor characters who come in and out.  The movie takes place over a 2 day period, and each day is a different story, so the movie has the potential to keep going over a long time.  Raimy's direction is well-done and I didn't really find that he made a mess of it.  In fact, his direction makes a pretty good horror film.  I have seen the horror genre through horror films and it has a strong focus on atmosphere and suspense and the acting is solid.  This is the kind of movie that will give you a good scare without having to have too much gore, gore and more gore.  If you like slasher films or have seen one and aren't a horror buff, then "Halloween" is a good pick to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a well made film.   I'm not a fan of the Star Wars prequel trilogy (although I liked a few of them) and this movie is a great alternative to those films.  It has a lot more of a focus on character than the prequel films and the whole story is excellent.  The action sequences are great.  I don't think I've seen an action scene in this film where two bad guys fighting isn't amazing.  And the sound is great, great soundtrack too.  This movie is very hard to find.  It's an excellent film and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a high school senior named Jeff who has some problems with his girlfriend, Jenny. Jeff loves Jenny but Jenny has a very cold personality, sometimes she does not even respond to his texts, it's like she doesn't really even care about him. The problems with her start when she sees a film on the television and she has a vision in her head of a little boy with glasses in the middle of a field playing with a baseball bat. The boy looks up at her and smiles, he is Jeff's childhood dream come true. She is excited about meeting him and wants to get him a gift.   What makes the movie great is that Jeff is played by a great actor named Kevin Pollak who has really grown into a great young actor. He looks like he is about 5 years younger than he actually is, and he has such a warm and charming voice, it makes you love him. His chemistry with Jenny is strong, she knows that she has to be with him, she is worried about him and is always worried about what she will do.

The director of the movie, Stephen Fung, was good at the beginning. I mean, he gave me a good time and it was nice to see some of his action sequences. It made me think I'm not in trouble. However, I got bored after the second act of the film. The only thing I liked about the movie was the ending.   The sequel was really bad. There were more movies like it but it was the second one that was really awful.

A funny film about the loss of the father you have always loved. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had to re-watch "Movin' Out" on Netflix. It's a great movie, but it's a little difficult to watch. You've got to watch it at least once with a little more "buzz" in your step.   This is a movie where the story is pretty basic. The main character is named Harry (John G. Blatz). He lives in a small town with his sister, brother and sister's friends, who are all kind and happy and the town itself is a happy little place. Harry is not that kind. He is not a happy kind. The thing that really bothers Harry, besides the fact that he hates his sister (Martha) and that his brother hates him (Joe) is that his mother and the people around her will do anything and everything they can to keep him happy. It is Harry's mother (Sally Kirkland) who teaches Harry to love. The things she does to him, he doesn't even know how to react to them, because to him they just seem like awful and disgusting things that she does. I think this is just where "M Movin' On" comes in and I think it's great that the movie is so straightforward. It was nice, though, to see where they came from and where the movie ends.

Ben has a huge crush on a beautiful girl named Alice and she seems to have all of his attention. One day, Alice makes Ben's life a living hell. She takes a piece of candy, and leaves the boy to choke on it. Ben manages to get the candy away, but can't get back to his girlfriend's house. It is a bit ridiculous, but Ben has to deal with this. The movie is pretty good. I liked Ben's dad. He is a little odd, but I liked him and his family. I also liked how Ben's friend and his mom did a lot to help the little boy.

He tells his sister about his father's affair and she believes him to be a murderer and she wants to kill him. But he is not there and she is so upset at what has happened that she starts to cry. As she cries, she begins to think about what had happened and what was really happening in the house.   On the other hand, a man, who had a close friendship with the father and mother, and who is also the lover of their daughter, has made a copy of a diary written by her mother and gives it to the journalist. The journalist tells the story to his friend about what happened and he reveals his feelings to the girl. When the girl goes back to the house she finds that her mother has been burnt to death. The girl is so very upset that she cannot find the mother's diary so she goes to a policeman who thinks that he can help her.  He tries to find out where the father was so that he could tell her about the affair. But the girl is still in a state of shock and she cannot remember. But one day the girl finds the diary and she remembers everything and her life turns around again.  A great, touching and beautiful film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw this movie I thought this is a very interesting and strange movie and I like the concept of the movie very much.  I loved the concept but I have to say the movie is a little bit boring.   I would have liked a little more action, a bit more humor and a little less of the strange and strange stuff.  Overall I had a good time watching this movie and i give it a 8 out of 10  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 20 minutes of "Punisher" will turn off the most casual audiences.   For those who do not know, "Punch" is a good book by Frank Miller, published in 1988. In his original version, Punisher is a member of a very large hit squad.  He is a "dumb-dumb" gun-toting badass, with no qualms about killing people who have done him no harm.  Punisher also likes to "play god" at times.  The story in Frank Miller's "PUNISHER" is not a great plot. In fact, I do not recommend the story.  However, the first 20 pages of "the book" are a great example of what is wrong with today's movies.  It is so bad, I could not stop laughing. The movie version is not nearly as bad.  This movie is not for everyone.  I suggest watching it with a friend and then asking the friend to describe the action as they watch it.  You can tell the movie is being made for a mainstream audience and is being produced for a very narrow demographic.  There are few "good" scenes and scenes that are funny.  In this movie, all the "good guys" are either psychopaths, or very violent.  Frank Miller does a bad job in this movie.  Even the villains seem unsympathetic.  For a movie so bad that it made me laugh, it is also a good way to get someone to watch it, even if they think it is bad. I highly recommend this movie to any true Frank Miller fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great comedy. The entire film is like an "Old Timey" musical. The actors all do a wonderful job. There is a lot of laughs, and a couple of great characters. I'm sure some people will hate it because they find the movie to be a bit vulgar and offensive, but I found it to be just fine. I've seen it before, and it always works well. I thought the movie would have been better if the movie had a few more good "comedic" moments, but it was pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story starts off pretty well. The film follows two teenagers who have been close for many years. They are good friends who have come from different backgrounds and they are now trying to find a way to put it all behind them. One is the tomboy, the other is the quiet type. The one who is quiet is not very good at talking to people or doing any of the typical teenage activities. The tomboy tends to be more of a natural leader and she has a bit of a tough exterior. The quiet one is a bit slow and has a hard time talking to others. They do try to make their way through life but they seem to be falling in love every time they walk into a new place. The movie shows a lot of love and a lot more maturity than the teen genre typically gets.   I've seen several teen movies where the teen leads a life of his own and seems to be doing all the things he is doing for himself and his friends. This movie takes a different approach. There are a number of young people in this movie that seem to have a lot going on. Most of them are involved in some kind of illegal activity or are in trouble with the law. Some have to be put away because they are not good for society. The last thing they want to do is go to their home planet for a long stay.  One thing I liked about this movie was that the story was really a lot darker than most teen movies I've ever seen. It really showed the negative effects drugs and teen living can have on a person.  The movie did have some good lines and it was well made.  I really didn't think that the romance was believable and I'm glad that it was not too fleshed out.  I don't remember anything about this film but it seems like it had a lot to do with a guy who was a little too into the female students.  Another thing that I liked a lot was the use of the real people and the planet. There was a real connection and it seemed like the people were all connected in some way.  For a teen movie, it had some good action scenes.  It seemed like a lot happened between the two characters but I'm not sure what happened. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little skeptical about this movie when I first saw it, but after watching a couple of trailers I have to say that this is a very interesting and well-made movie, and it definitely lives up to its hype. The plot and character development is very well done, and the acting is all pretty much top-notch. The cinematography is superb and the animation of the characters is top-of-the-line, too. The story and music are both very interesting, too, and I was very entertained while watching this film.   The movie starts out with some rather boring, old-fashioned police work, which then moves onto some interesting, but very formulaic, thriller-type stuff. The first half is very good, though, and by the end of the film the whole thing has a very enjoyable, if slightly "tired" feel to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of movies about a young girl with psychic powers or an alien kid, you will like this movie.   As I said earlier, the alien kid is a great lead and he is actually an adult.  He is like a human in terms of intelligence, but his powers are not to be underestimated.  I had fun watching the movie as I watched it and I would have liked it even more if they made an ending.  For this reason I would recommend you to see this movie even if you don't like childrens movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been waiting for a good sequel to "Sucker Punch" since "Suckers" opened in theaters in the summer of 2006.  The original "SUCKERS" was a comedy that played at the lowest of the low.  There were no stars to be found.  It was a story about a person whose life is falling apart.  His girlfriend left him, his parents are never there and now his job is over.  In an attempt to get over it all, he takes a job as a busboy at a popular Italian restaurant.  But when he shows up he finds the place full of people who are just as broken as he is.  If "SOUL SUCKER" is an exercise in despair then "SUMMER OF 2005" is a series of hilarious, heartfelt attempts at redemption.    A movie that is so bad that it's hilarious.  - May 13, 2005Cinematic disappointment  Reviewer: D-Cob - favorite favorite favorite - May 7, 2005  Subject: Suckers II This is an abomination of a movie, and the only reason it is being screened at all is because of the "rerun rights" that Paramount still has. Even if the film was good, it wouldn't stand a chance today with the rise of Internet-only films, since this one has no replay value to it. The reason for its "re-run" status is because, as with all the rest of the 80's B-movies, this one is riddled with awful effects, bad acting, and a terrible script. It's so bad, in fact, that I'm surprised anyone is still going to see it.   It would have been easier to just call it "Sucking Sodomy 2," since that would have made even less sense. If it had been titled "The Suckertown Boys," or "The Girls," it might have been better received.   (As it is, it's hard to even see this in the original 35mm print in my college library, but it does exist in a restored 35mm version. I was surprised by this at first, but then I remembered the film is in the Public Domain, so I might as well see it.) - May 6, 2005SuckERS II
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie really is a movie that needs to be seen, it is a great movie that just keeps going and going. The film was made before the "A Day Without a Woman" movement had gotten huge (a few years before) and really was one of the first big movies to tackle such a social issue.   The film is made very well, and it deals with such a huge social issue without being preachy or making a lot of claims. It does not shy away from the social issues in our society, it gives you some nice examples, and tells you some great stories.  The main character, a guy named Gary, who is an anti-war activist, goes out to try to show all the soldiers who were taking a day off that if they are not going to kill someone, why don't they at least go to work and make some money. The soldiers are not happy to see him, some are downright angry at him, and he gets some serious flack from one of his co-workers, who calls him a racist, and Gary ends up having to fight with his boss over this. The movie does not give too much away, but it shows a lot about war, the people in it, and why it is so hard to get an honest accounting of what is going on in the world when the media can just say anything it wants to when it is convenient. This movie is funny as well as depressing, and I would recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can remember seeing this movie back in the day, back when it came out in theaters and when it was on VHS. I was in my early 20s, and I wasn't into the genre of horror movies at all, but I was very intrigued by this film. I have seen it in theaters more times in the past 15 years, and it is still one of my favorite horror movies. The acting was very good (and the plot was just as good, I think), it's got good makeup and design work, and just a great overall movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a very good movie, and a great piece of entertainment.     The story was excellent, and the character development was interesting.  They use a lot of special effects to portray the effects of the meteor in this film.  It's a good action film.     For me, the best part of this film is the character of the young boy.  He seems like a kind and compassionate young boy, and he does have a little crush on the girl.  I wish that this movie would have been made in the 1970's, when the whole movie about the meteor would have occurred.  Would it be possible to make a movie about a comet?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, the premise of this movie is so cool and I wanted to see this movie since I was a kid. I saw this movie last year and now I saw it again and I think it is still as awesome as when I first saw it. The movie is about a girl named "Jenny" who has no idea why her dad is missing, then later when she meets a fellow missing person she meets the same thing and she begins to get scared, she thinks that her dad might be dead, then a friend who comes along with her and the only way they find is by being brave and finding the way through the wilderness.       The acting was really good on most of the girls but not as good as it was for me to see the same actor in the same part again and again, which I thought was odd because she was so perfect in the role, she did a great job with her character and I was so impressed with her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot was a simple one. A new guy, a new girl move in to a town, a couple of people get in trouble with a local mob and the only solution is to break into a safe and get money to buy some food for the people. Well they get caught and get locked up and they get to stay for a few days. They learn how to live in the town and do whatever it is you need them to do.   It doesn't end there.  After a while they all get sick and have to be looked after.  It is a really nice movie to watch and it's a great idea to get a small group of people together to get food for a group of starving people.  I wish I had seen it when I was younger  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's most interesting moment occurs at the climax of the film, when the police show up to investigate a missing dog.   This is a little reminiscent of a good old fashioned "somewhere in time" film, where the cops try to find out what happened in a small town where the police chief (played by Robert Shaw) lives, but of course he's gone now.  This would be a good, if a little short, movie, if you like those kinds of movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago, I had the honor of meeting with one of the most respected filmmakers in the world, Martin Scorsese. He is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite filmmakers, and I'm even more impressed by his filmmaking in this movie than I was in "The Wolf of Wall Street." As a guy who knows Scorses work well on both film and television, I couldn't help but feel some kind of sense of déjà vu. I thought that this movie was just as fun as it was when I was a kid, with a new sense of humor and a lot of great stories.

Good acting. 7. It's a good story, I guess it's hard to explain. 8. I liked all the characters (even one character I thought was pretty annoying). I liked that some scenes were very graphic, but not too graphic, I also liked that the special effects and special effects were good.   It was a good film, I'm glad it made its way to the theatres. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at the movie when it was released in the United States, at a midnight showing at the Loews Theatre in Los Angeles.   It was about two couples, and the movie started out really well.  When they went to the motel room to talk, and he started playing with her hair, she said that she had a secret from her past that she would never tell him about, and she did not want him to know about it.  Then the guy's mother came into the room, and they all sat down.  They had a long talk, about his family, and how she had been raped.  He said that it was a terrible thing to do, and that she was lucky she wasn't murdered.  Finally they made love, and had sex for the first time.  Afterwards, they had a picnic with a couple of the girls, and all the girls were watching them making love,  the movie was over.  The two couples had made love in a motel room.  A few months later, the husband came to her house, and asked if she could come in and sleep with him.  She agreed.  It turned out that the wife, had been seeing a man for a couple months, and was seeing him again.  At the beginning of the movie, the mother was having a secret conversation with her husband about her daughter.   The two women were very different.      While the mother loved her daughter dearly, she was quite jealous.   While the wife loved her, she never loved anyone.  This was the story of two women, trying to understand each other.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the early nineties, the US had two superpowers - one military (in the form of the Pentagon) and one industrial (in most cases) - the military dominated the news and the media with all the horror stories of terror and genocide. But what about our world? Where is the world's "evil" in this film?   This film is filled with the most realistic depictions of people's lives, from the streets of New York to the high end offices of the military.   The main character, a veteran of WW2, is a great example of a good guy who doesn't live for himself and is completely unsympathetic to the people he comes across.  And the worst thing? The movie was made in 1990 when we were only about 20 years from the end of the cold war. How did we get here? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A short, dark and mysterious film, it has a strange feeling that it is not quite sure if it is going to end happily or a bit more negatively.   It is a short but the story is interesting and a very good performance by its actors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie begins with two men having a very bad fight on the freeway. They have a fight and then they run into a bar and the bartender tells them they've got a real good fight in the bar. The guy that they fight tells them that he doesn't want to fight and he just wants a drink. So the fight continues. Eventually, the guy who was with them earlier comes over. He tells them the guy that was with him is not from around here and he says he will fight them. The two guys decide to go with him. As they're getting to his place, they start to argue about the guy he was with. They go into his house and find him sleeping on a bed. They tell him he has to leave his house. The next day, the two guys have a really bad fight and the guy, who was sleeping with them, comes out of nowhere and beats the crap out of the two of them. He then runs out the front door. The other guy goes to get a police officer and asks him to get the guy. The cop goes and gets the guy and they run off. Meanwhile, the woman is sitting in her car and is getting ready to go out to get her boyfriend. As she is going to get him, the police car passes and the police officer, now that he knows about the fight that went on in the house with the guy the two men had the night before, gets the hell out of there. Now, the lady, who has been out looking for the guy to see if he is dead or alive, goes to the bar and gets a drink and tells her boyfriend she wants to talk to him. So she walks in and sits in the booth. At first, the bartender doesn't know her and when she sits down she gives the bartender a look like, "What kind of a dumb woman are you? I didn't come here to sit in a dumb person's place and talk to a dumb fucking person!" The bartender asks the woman if she is alright. She goes to tell him that she is in love with the man from the bar who went and beat them up the night of. The bartender says he does not like the guy from the house and asks the lady if she knows what kind of man she is dealing with. She says, "Oh, no! This is someone I don't know. I know this guy from a bar fight two nights ago. I have to get my boyfriend from the

It is a nice movie and a good way to end a film season, I like the ending but I think the last 20 mins sucked. This movie is a good old fashioned movie about a guy who can do anything and has been doing it for years.   I am not a fan of westerns or cowboy movies but this movie was fun. I do not recommend this movie to others because I know that if you watched the whole movie in 3 hours, you would not have enough time to like it and would want to come back for another 3 hours.

My wife and I visited Nagasaki to see a very old friend. Nagasaki was a great and beautiful city, but unfortunately, Nagasaki has become more and more dead and desecrated over the last few years. We enjoyed seeing the ruins of a small town built by Japanese traders and settlers that flourished and flourished until the early 1900's. Unfortunately, in recent years, Nagas were bombed to bits, people were displaced and some buildings, including the temple in Nagasaki, were demolished and many people moved to Nagasaki. Nagas today are still being rebuilt. Nagasa is one of my favorite places in the world, and we will return to Nagasa in the future, when we return to Japan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always wanted to see a remake of a great classic.   There are few things that can give me more satisfaction than watching someone else have a great time with a good film.  A good comedy is just that.  It is quick to the point, funny, and just a darn good time.  With a script that is just the right amount of campy and silly, it is all you could hope for.  I am a big fan of John C. Reilly and he really brings out his personality in this movie.  He seems like a good guy and he gets to act all silly and ridiculous.  This movie just gets better and better from start to finish.  If you are a fan of the classic film, I would strongly recommend this movie to you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you don't know who Stephen Spielberg is, then you probably already know that he is the greatest movie director of our time.     His latest project "Saving Mr. Banks"   I   is his best yet.   The movie is a romantic adventure that is the type of movie you watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Stephen Spielberg shows his usual brilliance in creating an original and interesting film that is filled with action, humor and emotions.  I loved the movie so much I would like to tell you what made the movie awesome and what makes it an excellent film.  This movie will make you cry while you watch it.  When I first saw this movie, I was like "This is going to be like a western?"   When you think about a western, you think of guns, guns, more guns and some guys trying to get back their money and land.  But, Saving Mr.  Banks is much more.      This is an emotional romance about a young woman that wants a place to be in the world with her husband (the lead actor).   She decides to stay at a bank in Maine, even though her husband is being harassed by the bank robbers.  In the beginning of the movie, this young woman is all alone, because she has been a virgin since she was 12 years old.  She has a few friends who encourage her to get a job, but then this bank robber steals the money.  They are in a hurry to get out of the bank, so they run away and stay in a trailer.  That is where the film starts.  After running away, the young woman and her friends come across the bank robber's car.  The bank robber gets out of his car, gets in a fight and tries to shoot her, but the young lady saves her life.  Then, the bank robbery ends and the bank guard and bank robber meet at the diner to apologize.  Once they are done, the two friends go back home to continue their lives.  At the end of the film, the girls go back to the bank to find a safe deposit box for the money that the bank manager has in his possession.  With that, the movie begins to a complete end.  From that point on, the viewer feels like he is a member of the crew of the runaway train as they make their way through the countryside.  However, as

I loved it and I loved the way it was shot with a cool look and the characters and how they acted. They are all unique and I think they all would fit in a comic book if there was a comic for them! All characters were likable and funny, and the ending made me laugh so hard. I could not take my eyes off of this movie, and I will look for more like this movie in the future. The soundtrack was also awesome and I am sure I will listen to it a lot in the next months and years because it had some awesome music and the way they were putting in music was funny and it was all in time and in rhythm with the action. I love how they were showing me the different types of weapons and I liked how they used each character in their right way to kill. I loved this movie so much! I can't say much more about this awesome movie but I loved watching it and it made my day! I will watch this movie again and I may buy the DVD because I want to watch it again in all of its glory!

Ace Ventura tries to prove that the public is stupid and ignorant, by giving the audience ridiculous characters and ridiculous situations to participate in, such as: 1. "A guy gets a big red nose and a big, round ass, but doesn't think it looks like a dick" 2. "Crazy lady gets a lot of ass, and then the guy who is on top gets a hard-on and he is going to piss right into a toilet, but is afraid because he doesn't have any nuts" 3. "An old-fashioned cop gets a very fat wife in a bikini, then gets a little girl to take off her clothes, and get naked, and the mother of the young woman is the same age as the old-style cop" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The movie is set in early 20th century Japan. A young doctor (Hiroshi Matsumoto) gets a request to visit the family of a fellow doctor who has been murdered. The scene is full of blood and pain and there is the sound of many people screaming and crying in anguish. This is not a horror movie at all, however. It is an emotional and beautiful picture of a poor doctor going to the house of a dead woman and seeing what is left of her. The scenes were beautifully shot, with excellent use of color and the actors played the part very well. Matsumoti's character is deeply flawed and the film does a good job of portraying his weakness and remorse. This film is well worth seeing, even for a horror aficionado."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is funny and I like that it's different from all of the other movies I've seen.   I like the story and the characters.  It has a nice look to it.  I have a feeling that the film will have a good run. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie started out with a little cheesy and cheesy with the main character being a fat, old, ugly guy who had a short temper. Not the best character in the movie though. He did do some pretty stupid things though.    There is a little joke to be made about it too, that the main guy was a big fat guy and now that he was bald he could no longer stand it and kept telling himself to kill himself with his fist or something.  The whole movie had a really bad plot. The plot was so bad that it was hard to take the movie seriously. It was also bad in the fact that it seemed to have been created by people who didn't understand what an action movie should be about.  It did have a pretty interesting script though. It had a lot of action scenes that were really good. I really liked the action scenes and I thought they were very creative and realistic. The actors were really great, even the ones who were not well known or in the movies. All of the characters seemed real. I liked the movie and I can see why people would like it. It doesn't have a very big budget and it does have a budget to spare, so the movie is pretty cheap. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that the biggest downside is that you have to watch it in slow motion, not just because of the slow pace and the terrible acting. It's a film that has some good moments and some not so good moments, but it's the slow-mo scenes that really make this so great.   So if you like slow-motion films, then this is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie.   It has some action and lots of people doing funny and interesting things in different ways.  The best is the ending.  You know it is coming when the "bad guys" get sucked into a vacuum cleaner and they end up being a giant vacuum with a giant hand.  This is the movie for your Saturday morning.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The way they handled the story was wonderful, so I would say that this movie is a winner!    I'm not a big fan of horror movies. The stories can be just a little too corny sometimes and some movies seem to be just too dark and creepy to be entertaining. But, this one does it in a very original way and has a very positive, fun, and funny ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was happy to see it, the only bad thing is the movie started off a bit slow and then it starts picking up.   The story is told through the eyes of a child with psychic abilities, there are supernatural things happening in the town and the family who live there have no idea of what is going on.  While it wasn't as good as the movie made it look like a good horror film it has some good scare scenes and I give it a thumbs up.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What an amazing movie. My favorite character is the villain. He is a little creepy at first but once you get to know him he is totally cool. I was so happy to see a gay vampire. It is like watching a new horror movie. I didn't see the sequel but will. It's a good time watching it.   Posted by lisa at 6:30 PM

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved the book series. There were times when the book was a little too dark for my taste, but overall I really enjoyed it. I found it to be a very nice story and I could imagine myself getting a very good laugh out of it.   While I did not like the ending to this book series, I will say that I liked the movie it was based on.  Posted by Rene at 7:29 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (3) A little bit of humour, but more importantly a great character study.   I really enjoyed this film, as it is very well acted and acted well by all the leads.  The best part of the film is that the main character's name is Jack (I have been seeing this film on TV since I was about 8 years old), and the lead is not only very realistic, but has his own distinct personality.  This film is about a young guy whose father has had a lot of trouble with the law, and now it seems that he will be taken to jail, and that the father has got a plan to get away with it.  He doesn't tell Jack what he is up to, and neither does Jack know what it is.  When he is sent to be in a cell, he has a dream about someone who tells him, "If you are innocent, then go to the woods and go on a suicide spree."  This is not to be. Jack is set up to be arrested, he thinks that he is going to be taken in for a trial, and if he is guilty, then he will spend the rest of his life in jail.  His cell mate is a good looking man, who is not at all like his friend, the older, and much like him, wants to be a great actor.  But Jack has a different idea.  So they get out of prison and off the island.  Now we get a wonderful performance from the main actor, Jack, as well as the lead.  And as usual, the rest is very realistic.  I think that the film should be seen by everyone because of the way in which Jack tells his story. He is very honest and truthful, and there is a very strong emotional connection that he and the other lead make in this film.  It is a really good film and I do think that it is essential viewing for those who want to understand why the courts in our country are often stacked against the people.  Thank you to all the people who made this film possible, and especially those who worked on it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a good time. If you don't mind a little bit of nudity, then this is a good choice. The best part for me, though, was the performance by Liev Schreiber. He is not your typical actor, not as stiff as you would think, he's really good with the camera, a real star. And the best part of the movie was, that this movie was well made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first encounter with The Black Dahlia Murder and what an impact it made on me as a film-goer and a film lover. I had seen their other work in the '70's and then I came across The Black Rose which I loved but this film is on another level and as much fun as it is terrifying.   I have to say I loved the gore aspect of this movie as well as the way that it was edited.  It was a truly horrifying and disturbing film and I am glad that I saw it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has the same feeling as Star Wars or the original Harry Potter. I saw this movie at a theater in the Bay Area and I thought it was just a normal action movie. And I thought I could relate to the character of Dario, because he was a guy who had had a bad childhood. He wanted to change that, and so he goes to the Philippines to help the local people. So the problem with this movie is the plot. There is no story. This movie is just an action movie with a lot of humor. The music is the same as the songs in the Harry Potter books. They all are great. I could not understand the words to most of the songs. And the characters were all really cute.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good, but it is not a great movie. It's just a movie that is not bad, but not a good one either.   In this movie, the characters are a little uninteresting to me. You don't get much in the way of interaction between them. They act like they are trying to say something, but their dialogue is very boring. When they say something in a movie, it's usually in a way that is too cliched.  There is nothing really to say about the movie other than it isn't bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I ever saw this movie, I was in the first ten minutes or so when the main character is reading a book in the park, while two boys are playing soccer and listening to a radio station. The boy who's reading a picture book to a girl he just met and whom he had a crush on from the beginning tells her about the girl he is seeing and how he has fallen in love with her, and he also says how he could not find a girl who was just like her.   When the movie starts, the movie is very slow and the dialogue is very low in volume and meaning.  The main character starts to read his story about his love.  They then go to see a movie that is set in a country that is the same country that the main characters have just come from. The movie is full of beautiful color and wonderful music.  It is also very realistic.  There are even pictures of women and children. The story also moves at a very nice pace and I was fascinated by the story. The picture book that the girl is reading is very realistic and realistic. It is very interesting how the characters of the movie act with each other.  This is my first time seeing a movie set in such a realistic country and I enjoyed it.  I was very pleased with the movie and the actors did a good job in bringing the story to life.

In one hand is a man who is holding a gun and in the other hand a piece of paper which has a drawing that says "Dump the Police".   The scene was just unbelievable.   It was a real throw back to an old style of crime fiction that is just so exciting and it's all in a day's work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a little trouble with this one at first but once it got going I loved it. It is a nice little romp with good effects, but I think the story is a little too complicated. I am a big fan of horror and fantasy stories. This one is a great example of both.   My niece liked it and wanted me to read it too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had my doubts about the entire project at first but what they got was really pretty and was a great sequel to  The Empire Strikes Back.  I think that it could even be a little bit better than that sequel because it was a little more action and not just a couple of minutes of that.   This was a really good action movie.  I really liked how they took the movie in a different direction which I think is a good idea because it seems that Lucas took this movie in the direction of a good and original action movie which is a really great change.  What was interesting about this movie was the way that they showed the different characters and the different relationships between them and how the action was presented in different parts of the movie so it kept the movie interesting.  So overall I give this movie a very good rating and I will probably be watching it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story was really good!   It was a very good, good old fashioned noir noir movie that had lots of action.   I didn't like the story of the girl who got locked up with a crazy person and the people she ran with but it was entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is very good, and i have to say the best film in the first ten to fifteen years of the series, at least in the USA, and possibly in the entire world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie, I was kind of disappointed with its premise. It had a plot that was mostly about a bunch of characters being in a bad movie and being forced to watch it.   I thought it was rather funny and that's not a bad thing, but it wasn't really a good idea to start a movie with a buncha people having a bad time in a movie theater and that would just be the kind of bad movie it is.  But I was really interested in seeing how a bunchy movie would end up being.  A bunchy ending and a bunching up of some of the characters I thought was interesting and funny at the same time.  The acting was decent with some very funny lines in it, so I think this movie had a little bit of everything that was good in it. And the ending is pretty cool. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Cult of the Dead" (or is it "Death Cult"? The title is somewhat misleading as the film is not about the dead but rather about the people who try to find them. The only problem is that the movie is too slow, and not really scary but still there's something entertaining about it. The film is about the "cult" that is dedicated to find the "dead" people who have disappeared and try to revive them. Some of these "cultists" have been murdered before, and one of them has the ability to turn his dead into living people, though not that of a true reincarnation. A few years ago, a mysterious woman who was the sister of a dead person, has found her brother's body, which now appears to be a person living like a real person. So she decides to revive him with the help of an alchemist and a scientist. The results are not that great, as she can turn the dead back into the living, but she is able to bring back a few people. The real attraction of the movie for me is that you will not know what is going to happen next. As you are watching the movie you will notice that you are not sure if the characters are really alive or not.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favourite part of the movie is when the old lady sees that a truck driver is going to do a drive by with his car. She goes to the road to warn the driver. It's too late. When the driver comes by the old woman is killed. But the driver never stops there. He goes around and around, he does a hundred handstands, he gets to where the sun is shining, but the truck hits the tree in front of the woman's home, and the tree falls down and breaks his neck, killing him. This is the end of a movie that really gets going at the end, and I'm not sure if it was the fact that it was a summer movie, but it was one of those movies that stayed with you.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was quite enjoyable. The plot is very well written and very well done. The only complaint I have is with the characters. I like how the main character is portrayed as a normal guy who doesn't do anything special that makes him stand out. It's like he was made to be a normal dude who happens to have a magic sword that is only seen in legends and fairy tales. The character was very much likeable but I found it to be hard to connect with the movie because it was a little hard to believe that all of the characters would be able to accomplish what they did. I liked how the movie kept its focus on the characters and not the magic sword. I felt like I understood what the sword was used for at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a story about a man and a woman in love who have just moved to a new town in Canada. They are still quite young but they are very mature and they have no intention to live very long, but for a while they can't live without each other and are happy in each other's company. It's all a very pleasant story, very enjoyable to watch, very well made, very realistic, very moving, very beautiful to see. And it has to be said that you are seeing a man/ woman in their prime in their 20's, which for many a young person is quite an age.     I really think this was a good film.  A good film that's true to life!   I don't think you will be disappointed by this film. I can see that it's really made by a great director.  If you are a lover of movies, like myself you'll like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are very few films in the last 20 years that have given me that same feeling as   My Bloody Valentine. It's an incredibly romantic, yet extremely dark film about a man who wants nothing more than to find his true love, but is constantly plagued by a mysterious killer.   It's like a film from an indie horror movie and a good one at that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not a fan of horror movies. I really didn't like most of them. When I saw this movie I was expecting a bunch of jump scares but instead it was something else. You don't get that feeling like you expect it. You are left asking, what is this, a horror movie or some kind of a religious movie?   The ending was a little weird, but you get it.   For a movie called "The Devil's Bride" it was pretty good, even though there were a couple of jump scares in there. I give it a 2 out of 5 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is one of the best I have seen, and the best sci-fi movies I have come across.  The actors are all amazing, and all are excellent.  They have to do a lot of acting to be able to come off as believable as they do.   One thing I thought was really neat was the fact that they are almost in a spaceship at the beginning of the movie.  It adds to the sci-fis reality that the audience is supposed to be living in, without giving away too much to get a movie that is more or less a movie. It's good for sci- fi movies.  I can't say how much I appreciated the use of the sound and the great story told.  When you think about it, the movie does take some liberties and it is more "a movie" than a proper sci- fie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You've got a decent comedy in here, and it's very funny, but also very dark, and you don't really get into it all that much. It's a funny little comedy, with a few twists.   It's worth a watch if you're looking for a light-hearted comedy, or if you can tolerate it when it's not the main focus of the movie, otherwise you'll probably want to skip it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film, but with a twist!   The twist is that the man is also a woman!  The story follows a couple who move into a new town in Canada.   They start an overnight camp out, and find a young boy (the father) who is missing.  He has been seen hanging from a tree by the tree.  The girl takes it upon herself to find him.  When they find him, they find that he is actually a little girl.  There is also the boy's brother (who seems to be her older brother) who must play the part of the mother to her.  Also, the father, as the husband, is in love with the mother.  I liked it very much!  A very happy ending to a great story! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film follows a man named Johnny (played by John Waters) who has been trying to make a movie called "The Best in Show". Johnny is a director whose last film he made was a movie that never was made. The movie is about a man who has a girlfriend that he breaks up with. He tries to get her back after he realizes she has a son. He meets a guy who is doing something similar and the two start to have a thing. A lot of people in the film get the point of the story (or not) but for those that like Waters' style of cinema there are some cool moments.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first ever action movie, was released in the States as a straight to video movie in 2004, starring Michael B. Jordan as the lead, and was written and directed by Peter Segal (Crocodile Dundee) and written by Michael Tarkovsky (Citizen Kane). It follows a group of mercenaries who are hired to kill a wanted man named Jack Black.   The film was so good that I saw it twice. The first time I saw the movie it was so intense that I almost forgot to breathe for the entire movie, and then I went back to watch it again and found out it was a movie that I didn't want to stop watching. It kept getting more intense and better, and I kept wanting to go back and see the sequel.  A must see action movie.

The story is about a girl (Sara) who is a victim of a strange disease (or is it?) and is trapped in a mysterious house with a strange person, whom she has a crush on. She tries to escape the house but can't.  The movie has a fantastic plot and an eerie atmosphere.  I found the movie to be well produced and well acted.  It is hard to figure out who is the evil and who is in a good place with this movie. I think it's easy to see why the film won a film festival award.  This movie is just too good to go un-mentioned.  Recommended!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film that I think is perfect for all age groups and is a must have for all movie lovers.   I wish the movie was made for my age group so I could watch it all the time!   It is a wonderful story of a boy and a girl who is not as good as their father.  They have to travel to other countries to find a cure for their father who is sick,  and the film is just the perfect combination of animation, music, story,  characters and humor.  The story of this film has a lot of heart and really makes you feel bad for these two characters who are trying to do the right thing.  This movie also has a story line of a girl from a poor family who is a scientist trying to find and cure the sick brother.  I loved all the characters who I liked very much.    When the music gets good you can hear the sound of a real live band and even when the music is a little off (like when you see the boy's hand on his head), the music and sound effects add a nice touch to the movie.  Even though the movie is short and the storyline is a bit confusing (like I said I thought it was a dream) and you want more then what is shown (which was only about an hour and a half) I enjoyed it a lot and I want to watch it again.  And it is only $8.00 which is very inexpensive!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good :   I just had to take a look at this film because I had just seen The Descendants. It was a good film but the same as The Descent was not very good in the whole.   There are things that can be good and are actually good and there are bad things.  I was just surprised by the bad.  There is nothing wrong with the film but I didn't see why it was so bad. The film is made by a guy who is very good with making short films.  So that's not very interesting. The movie is made of a short film and the short film has not much to do with the real film that is about one of the most interesting characters I have seen in a while.  The movie will probably get better but I don't really see anything else that's interesting.  The movie is not that interesting and I would just say don't watch this movie at night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie, I love it, the cinematography is great, the characters are very likable, I could imagine this film without the crazy stunts, and some of the effects. If you like martial arts and comedy movies you should see this. The story is so good, I like the action and fight scenes. The characters are so likable and the humor is funny. You don't have to read the story to enjoy it, you get a good laugh from it.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from a must-see action movie I would describe this movie as a hybrid between a kung fu movie and a thriller. It starts off very intense with some very intense fight scenes, but it never gets too over the top. In my opinion, there are many scenes that would not work well in a mainstream movie, but they work very well in this movie. It is a good watch for fans of the genre.  I liked it so much! I watched it a couple of times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at a theater I didn't know. I think I was a tad annoyed. There were so many of them that you could go down to the parking lot and it wouldn't make any difference. I saw it with a group of friends and we did all have the same opinion: "I don't like that movie." So we turned our backs and went into the theater. We watched it through with our backs turned and left together. This movie made no sense to us, because we didn't think it made any sense. It seemed to be a movie about an angry person getting even with someone he thinks is wrong, only to find out that he is right. It makes no sense! No. 1! It made us laugh, but at the same time it made no difference! We never could figure out how they could have done such a thing, and the reason we couldn't figure it out is because we never thought it made sense at all!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In many ways, A Tale of Two Cities is a masterpiece, one of the most important and enduring works of fiction ever written.   It's the story of a young man's relationship with his father, the story's narrator, which is set in the time before the Revolution.  The young man, named Ching-Kung (or Ching Ching, as he is known), is from a poor family, and has no real sense of justice.  As a young adult, he meets a man who gives him a sense of morality, the Reverend Seward (or Seward), who has a small church in the city of Boston, and Ching meets a new woman, Maria (or Maria), who lives in the same neighborhood and has the same last name as Ching's mother.  Seward takes Ching to a place called "The Square" where he has a discussion with an Indian about the morality of the Revolution, and the Indian refuses to believe that the Revolution would have been good for his people. The Reverend Sewards then has a spiritual experience of his own, where he is told about a man called "Earl" who is a prophet.  After learning about Earl, Ching goes to see him in person, and Earl appears to him as a figure of pure goodness.  In an act of great selflessness and charity, Ch'ung asks Earl to give him a place in his church, and when Seward gives Ching the place in the church, he has no idea what is in store for him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very good movie, very good cinematography and great direction. Its the first big horror movie with a good story, good acting, great special effects. It has lots of scares, and you get very good atmosphere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was so pleased with this movie that I could hardly wait for its theatrical release, but then... there it was! The internet was full of hype about this movie. I knew it was going to be good. This movie is pretty simple, with good acting, a good script, and some good visuals. However, the best thing about it is that the film's ending, which was very well-done, made me laugh out loud.   This movie made me feel a lot of emotions: relief, anger, relief, sadness, anger.  This movie made my heart go pitter patter!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched " The Great Mouse Detective " for the first time last night. The last couple of films I saw had a lot of things that were great, but this movie was a real treat. It was a good thriller, but also a good comedy. It didn't take a lot to understand the story, but it did give me a good laugh. The cast was good, as well. They were all funny and I thought all of them were good. I have never watched a movie so funny. And I am a serious fan of these kinds of movies. It is a must see movie for any fan of mystery, or funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie back in 1992 and I enjoyed it. It was an early 80's horror film made by a film producer who had been making the same films since 1969 but decided to change things up a bit with his sequel "The Return". I was not expecting it to be a horror film. I figured it would just be a re-telling of the first movie, with some of the more violent scenes removed.   As a matter of fact, I don't remember a single scene that was left out from the original film. It made me laugh and scream at the same time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think that I would enjoy this movie as much as I did. The movie itself is about a group of people that live together. They are a very dysfunctional group. One of the main characters, named Chris (Robert Loggia) is very jealous, and he has a problem that he doesn't know how to deal with. He can't seem to keep his hands off of the people that he likes. In one of the more disgusting scenes that I have seen in a movie, the people in his room are having sex. The one girl is on top of him and he is masturbating and he keeps saying to her, "I'm so close to you. I can't get enough of you. Don't stop, don't stop." Then he gets up and starts to go out and the girl looks at him and says, "He'll never get it up." I would recommend this movie to a friend and I'm sure you will like it too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An incredible tale of love, hate, murder and redemption, this is one of the best films I have ever seen.   It has everything: heart, humor, heartbreak, gore, love, love.  From the first seconds you realize that this film is truly unique and completely unique.  And for a film about a bunch of people living in a house that looks like an old shack, it really shows.  A truly good movie, no need for a score. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My son has just had a birthday, so my wife and I decided to get together and do some shopping. We found a great gift store that looked like it was owned by a Native American tribe who could have walked around in the olden days. They had an Indian Costume shop, some Indian jewelry, and a nice selection of Indian crafts. When we walked in they showed us a beautiful Indian dress that we liked very much. My wife was already wearing her long black silk kilt. After we bought all of our gifts we bought a nice little Indian pipe, and sat down for a nice day of shopping. This was a very pleasant surprise.   In the store I picked up a little Indian rug, and then I noticed the girl with the blue eyes and white skin and I was intrigued. I bought the book and looked at pictures. This is definitely an entertaining movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - August 15, 2010The most powerful ending I've ever seen in a movie.  Reviewer: thecagehounds - favorite favorite favorite - April 15, 2008  Subject: I was not there... The film opens with an interview with a man who says he is a "former CIA agent" and an "expert" on UFOs, UFOs and aliens. This is where things start to get weird.   The film is a story about a man, who has been given a choice of either "return to Earth and work as a laborer" or "become a "pilot" and save his planet. The choice of a "laborer" is rather easy to understand: there are few jobs in this world to begin with. The other option is to become an "alien hunter," which is the hardest, most dangerous and least lucrative job in the universe.   in any case, the film is about a group of "alien hunters" who find themselves in the "Middle East" where they encounter "UFOs". (The Middle East is a region which lies just beyond the southern tip of the Mediterranean Sea which is also called the "Mideast".)   As the movie progresses, it becomes more and more obvious that this story has been invented to justify the existence of UFOs. (Yes, I know there are UFOs.) They meet "U.S. military" pilots, who say that UFOs "don't exist". They also get into trouble with the Arabs because they come to the Middle East "to get us out of their trouble". (I think that means they come into our territory to conquer us.) The film then makes it clear that the "Ufo hunters" are going to get "busted" by the government because they are a danger to the "government" and "to our planet". (A good plot line. I liked the alien encounters that were not seen at the beginning of the film.)   I think the ending of the movie is good too. The whole story is a great story with a good twist and a good ending. The ending is very good, and I hope that the movie will be made in the future. I would like to see this story adapted to a TV movie. - April 16, 2008I was notThere was one night that I had a dream: in the dream I saw the movie "The Thing" (1985), which was based on a book by Robert Bloch
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so disappointed that I did not feel like going to the theater for this one. I saw it the night it was released on DVD and it was a good, good movie. I really liked it. However, I didn't feel like I was missing out.   One of the things I like about this movie is that it gives us the chance to see the differences between a male and female cat. I liked that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love a good action movie. I love the special effects, the good set pieces and the amazing stunts. This one was very good. The action scenes were very well executed and very satisfying. The main villain is very evil, the henchmen are also very mean, but they never show it. The story is simple and the ending, to me, is a little ambiguous. The ending is not a good one, but there is no way I could go out and see a bad action movie (see The Raid, for example). If you like to see bad action movies, this is a good choice. I will definitely go out again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think I like a lot about this movie. It's quite good. The movie starts off with a bang: We meet a lady who doesn't want anyone to call her a freak. She doesn't feel like her body belongs to anyone. She wants a doctor to remove her organs. We watch a couple of surgeries to find out what she really wants. She says that her body is too strong, and that she's afraid to change her mind. The doctor is quite a man. He is very gentle, and seems quite calm. He tells her that if she wants to get rid of her body, she needs to get a lot of painkillers and drugs. The guy with her says that there's nothing wrong with her body and that it's perfectly good and just needs to be changed. The woman tells the guy that she has a lot to tell her husband, and the man agrees to get her a husband. This is a very strange story. I can't really say what was the point of it. The story was not too strange. There were a few odd things. The first time we meet the couple, they are standing over some naked woman on the bed. There are many details I don't like about this story: The guy tells the woman that he has to clean her up. The wife is not too pleased, but tells him that she would clean up too. The man has a really big beard, and his wife is very small in stature. They also wear the same clothes. I think that the movie needed to do a little better with the story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... Well, I can not recommend this movie to anyone, at all, because it's a movie for an ignorant public who does not know a lot of history and who does its best to believe the lies of the communists and to be loyal to the people who killed their loved ones. The movie does not explain that many of the people of the communist regime (those who didn't have a gun) were shot and killed as they tried to escape the Communist prison camps. The film tries to show that all those who fought the Red Army were not bad people, who wanted freedom and justice for their country, but were the victims of the Communist tyranny.   The movie shows that the Germans (and other Europeans, who had not fought against the communists) were the aggressors and that the Soviet army was an army of liberation, which liberated Europe from the oppression of the Nazi fascists and the communist tyranny. The story of the movie is based on the propaganda of the Russians in World War II and the way the Russians treated the Jews and others who had fled from the Nazi atrocities. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why it is that I have to write a positive movie review about the good old classic, "The Day The Earth Stood Still", but I have.   It's hard to believe that anyone of the average age of the original audience (which is almost everyone on this planet in the year 2000) still has the capacity to love such a silly movie.  Yes, it has its moments of greatness but what really holds it together is a very sincere heartfelt feeling for what humanity can accomplish.  And if you are willing to be swept along by this film to a point where all you can think about is how wonderful it is to have the power of life and death over you...   Oh, yes, this is a great film.  I recommend it with all my heart.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen several films that were based on children's books, but none that really impressed me as much as this one.   The story revolves around a little boy named Jack who is left by his parents at the circus when they are off on a tour.  It is here that Jack meets the monkey's that he encounters at the different shows, and when he discovers that there are other creatures there, he is captivated.  These animals are all intelligent and are shown to be pretty clever when it comes to making their way around the circus, and Jack is not to be trifled with, even if he is a bit over-sensitive.  They have a good time playing around and trying to find each other, and I think a young boy would enjoy this one, too.  Some of the characters are a bit too adorable, and they are not in the least bit annoying.  But the main thing is, I don't think any kid would want to go to a circus in the middle of winter!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with a montage of shots in a diner, a shot of a young man in a red baseball cap, his blue eyes looking at a woman with dark hair. The camera is tracking him as he stands in the doorway of a dingy diner, he takes a few shots as he passes the waitress who turns and looks at him, he smiles and turns away and looks into a glass window at a beautiful day.   In a few scenes he has a few romantic encounters, as he talks to a girl he calls "Ginny", she tells him that he is too young for her but then says "Why don't you go out and have some fun?" She takes out a gun and says "That's what I do," the film ends with him holding up the gun and pointing it at her. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic: the one and only movie I'd like to give a bad review to because it is about nothing.   I'm not one to watch movies that only talk about themselves, but the script is written very well.  For those who aren't fans of movies about people, don't worry, there are some good moments in here (that the movie is about the one).   This movie is not what I'm looking for as a film that has a simple premise; a man finds himself in a strange house with a young boy, a girl who doesn't want to have sex with him.  After being chased through the house, he gets a job cleaning out the pool, then goes in, and a strange woman comes in.  The movie is only about these people, and it doesn't really focus on anything else.  I wish the movie would have shown more of this man and the boy; if they had, I would have loved the movie more.  At one point, the boy says that "she is a person, she does have a soul".   The director, Steven Soderbergh, did a decent job with this, but it's not really a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting a bad movie and I got a good one. It was entertaining and the plot was intriguing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think I would just say, that even though this is a story that is a bit off center, you need to try and look past the "what is going on" part of it. I just want to tell you what was going on in my head the whole time, about this film. The movie is very pretty. It is very beautiful. The characters are all pretty pretty, and they all are very pretty pretty (with the exception of the fat guy). I think that it is a little bit "colorful" (I don't think it is). It is kind of like a children's story, and I would say it is about a boy who becomes fat and gets his face bitten off by a giant snake. Now if you remember that the movie was produced in the late 50's, which at the time, is when the body horror and the body eating movies, were pretty popular, the movie probably has a bit of a shock factor to it. But that is ok. I liked it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been looking for a good horror movie, one about a killer, but the script was horrible. The guy played by Joe Don Baker was a complete loser and his character was a loser in every way. I think he is a sadistic killer, and not a very good one. If anyone saw this movie they would think it was a joke, the only joke is his name.   The film was about a guy that went to his neighbors house to talk about a problem. He came back to find his house has been completely gutted out. The police are calling and his friends are coming to tell him what he did.  This is a good example of how a horror movie should be. It has everything a good film needs. A killer, a guy with a problem and a real killer. This is what a good thriller movie should have.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an excellent addition to the classic horror genre. The film is told in the first person which is a little bit awkward at first but after a while the pace picks up and the film gets a lot more exciting. The acting is superb and some of the most intense scenes ever committed to film. The violence is intense and extremely violent in a sense that it is almost pornographic. The characters are portrayed extremely realistically and there are many different kinds of murders committed by these killers. The plot is extremely clever, funny, very effective and it is a really enjoyable film that will really leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.   We're back in space and we meet Dr. N and his assistant Dr. I.  The plot is straightforward.  Dr. B and Dr. R, an old scientist and a young woman, are stranded in space.  I found this movie to be very well written.  It has an interesting plot and a fun plot.  We meet Dr N and Dr I and have to decide who's right.  Both seem good people but they really don't like each other.  You're not allowed to love Dr I as much as Dr N because he can talk a whole lot of nonsense (which really is the way he talks) and he's very smart but really doesn't know what he's talking about.  They both have a crush on each other and it's just a little too obvious.  However, Dr. W can do a lot better, so he's a good scientist.  Now, Dr I can't tell who's a real scientist and who's an actor and he really doesn the most ridiculous sounding talk.  He also really doesn t like the scientist and Dr N very much.  His name is Dr. T but we learn later that he's really a girl.  In other words, I found the movie to have a lot of fun in every scene.  After the crew find a new planet (the movie was made in 1968) and decide to name it after themselves, they meet Dr S.  This guy is the most fun to watch.  S is a man of science and knows a lot about how everything works.  Even though he's the smartest man on the ship, he's still a child at heart.  And he's always saying the stupidest things.  If you don't laugh your ass off, then you don  t understand anything at all.  One of my favorite lines of the movie is, "In science there is no wrong idea.  "   This movie has a lot more laughs than you might think.  My favorite part was the scene where they discovered a planet that had a whole bunch of animals living there, and Dr S (who was a pretty good scientist) had to take some of the animals to his lab in order to find out how they were made.  That was really good!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to think of a better example of how to make a film than a film which is so utterly, insanely stupid that I really have to admire it for being so fucking stupid. And the stupidity is there from the start, when it's decided that a character is supposed to be a member of a band which is played by a few idiots, including the director.   This is the only film where the main character is a woman and not a man. And she's only a band member, not a singer or something.  The story involves a man who has been shot while out in the country on a fishing trip and decides to find his way home to his family. But, as is often the case, there are more things at play than simply the path home for the man.  One of these things is a sort of anagram about a lady whose brother-in-law was murdered. And he doesn't exactly want his sister to know because he's worried her brother- in-law may find out about this and it will ruin his reputation.  But he's got a problem: there is another brother-who-killed-his-sister-who is a police officer! So he has to do a bunch of things to ensure his sister does not know about this. One of which involves a series of phone calls.  A phone call to a guy called 'Mr. Stubby' who is a local businessman in a part of town which is being heavily bombed, and who can't come back due to the bombs. But there are people in town who do know and know how to call this guy, and the man tells the phone operator that he will give him a free ticket if he finds the phone. So there are a couple of people who go to the phone booth where Mr Stubby hangs up the phone and they think Mr Stubbys name is 'Stubby', and so Mr Stubbs phone is answered by some people, who also know his name as 'Stubbs' and this is a joke.  And there's another group who go back to the man's sister's house where her brother was murdered and see the murder weapon in a drawer. But it's a knife which was used to kill the man! And they decide that the killer must be a woman because all the murders in the town are men, and all the women have been killed! So a group of women are called to investigate.  Of course
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this one twice now. My second viewing was at about 7pm (when the movie was over) on a Friday night. I went with a friend who has already seen it a couple of times. We sat down to enjoy a movie that we had not seen before (although, I should have known). We were immediately taken by the excellent voice acting, wonderful cinematography, and wonderful storyline.   We were introduced to the two main characters: Riddick and his human brother Vin Diesel. Vin is a very talented singer and actor who is on a mission to find Riddicks mother and to find out why he is the way he is. His quest leads him into a world filled with criminals, monsters, and some very interesting human characters.  Riddik's love for his brother grows stronger with each scene we see of them together and it is clear he adores his brother.  While Vin is on the hunt for Riddkicks mother, his love for him grows stronger and more obvious with each moment they spend together.  These two characters, Vin Diesel and Riddiddick, are well written and have a great dynamic with each other.  My only complaint was the fact that Vin gets killed off early in the movie and we never get to know the true story behind Riddicke, his mother, and why they are fighting.  This movie is definitely worth the watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The action was fast and furious! I was just watching it on my way home from work when I was approached by a small red van that was driving down the street. After the driver pulled over, he went into the back of his van and got back out about 10 minutes later. As soon as he stepped out of his car I got the feeling I was in the middle of an exciting crime story. It was then I noticed that the man in the red van had a very distinctive look about him. When I first saw him, I thought he was a drug lord. But this guy looked a little too good. I am a big fan of this movie and I can't wait to watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most movies I have seen, there is not much plot to it. The main protagonist, a man named Mr. Flanders is a construction worker who, along with his wife Mary and two of their four kids, is living in a shack at the edge of the woods. Mr. and Mrs. Flander work on the Flanders' farm as night shift laborers. At one point, the kids are going out one night to take a shortcut to a nearby town. They are interrupted by a man who runs up to them, guns a blunderbuss and says "We are looking for you". Mr. the construction worker responds, "That's a long way from here" The man then says "What do you think you are doing?" Mr.Flanders replies, "We're out to enjoy a peaceful night" The construction worker then tells Mr. his wife and the children have left town so that he and his son can spend a night in the shack in a deserted area. "I'll let you live, just don't go looking for us" says Mr.The construction worker and he are then interrupted by the other man. The man says, "I'm a policeman. I'm looking for my missing son". The man walks up to the shack. Mr Flanders grabs his gun and says, to the policeman "You are the son of a bitch! I am going to shoot you" Mr.the construction worker pulls the trigger but the shot is dodged. The policeman then says, I've got to give you a second. A little later, Mr.and Mrs.Flander wake up to find their son gone. They call the police. The police arrive but Mr. does not recognize him. He thinks he must be some local drunk. They then see a man walking towards the shack and ask him to get in. The guy replies, to his mother, "What's wrong, I don't need a room" He then gets in the cabin and tells his parents, "Please don't worry. It's just a dream." As the parents see the man walk out the door they start to panic and cry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little worried about The Great Escape. When I saw the trailer I was worried that it was going to be a boring movie with a boring story. I was not worried at all. When it came to the actual movie I was absolutely amazed. It is a very enjoyable movie to sit through. It has a good story that is told really well. It seems that this movie takes place in a prison in 1939, but I'm not so sure. The thing I loved about this movie was that it actually had a lot to say about things and was very realistic about it. Also, I love that when they were rescuing the people in the cells they would actually have a "prison riot" going on!   There were a lot of laughs to be had. There was a bit where they were trying to find out if a prisoner could actually speak English. They were using a little machine that was similar to that in the first Ironman movie that would read the sentences out loud. The prisoner's answer was "I don't know! My mother said I was mute!". So it was pretty amazing how they were able to actually read those sentences out!  This is a great movie.   It is entertaining, funny and realistic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie that is full of laughter and good fun. The movie is about a group of friends in the 1950's who do odd jobs in the Hollywood hills while trying to raise money for a trip to Tahiti to see the sights. They have many silly hijinks including a party where the hostess has the guests paint her toenails black and put her in a diaper while she is drunk. The best part about this movie is the actors who play the characters: !   - Fred Bonservich was a great actor in many films like The Blues Brothers, The Blues Bros, The Great Escape and others.  ! - George Reeves was an excellent actor in several other films like the ones mentioned above.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't expect this movie to be good, and I am still not completely sure how good it is. However, I found that, for the most part, it is a good, action-packed movie that will provide you with some laughs and a good time.    The movie is a film that was made to get you in a car.    In the beginning of the movie, the movie starts out with a police chase across the streets of Los Angeles.  This movie had many things going for it. It is fast-paced, has a good plot, and an original theme.  However, it doesn't take long for the movie to get a little stale.  I don't think I've seen a bad action movie in a while.  After the car chase, the police are trying to catch up with the thieves, who is still at large.  The thieves are a couple of guys who use their "walls" to hide from the police.  These guys go by the names of Vinnie and Johnny, and the movie shows them taking down a number of police cars along the way.  Vinnie has a "sniper" rifle with a scope that he uses to shoot at the police cars.  Johnny has a shotgun that he is always using, and he has a.357 magnum that he gets out by blowing a hole in a wall.  Both of these guys are very good at what they do, and they are always on the lookout for police cars that are trying their best to catch them.  When the police get close, they can hear a very loud gun battle and a lot of shooting.  One officer is knocked unconscious, and when the other officers get out of their cars, the robbers are nowhere to be found.  They do eventually appear at one point, but they end up being destroyed by the police before they can do anything.  While this is going on, Vinnie, Johnny, etc. are all working together.  Their plan is to get to the bridge in front of the bank.  It is on this bridge that the thieves are supposed to meet a guy named Jim.  As the movie progresses, Vinda and Johnny's plan is put into action.  In one scene, Vanna (the main character) tries to take out the police by driving her car at a high rate of speed.  Unfortunately, the cops are fast enough to catch the car.   Johnny takes a shot
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is something about a film that is just so strange. It was a perfect blend of psychological, sci-fi, and horror.   This is a classic for a reason, but like with the others the ending is a little unsatisfying. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished this movie and I liked it very much. I loved the fact that the whole movie was just a comedy! It's like the "Funny or Die" show but not so serious. A bunch of goofballs have a party and then they take a trip out to a nature trail and they get lost and find that the trails end right in the middle of a river and they have to swim to the other side of the river so that they can get back to the party.   There were so many laughs, so many gags and I didn't feel bored all the way through.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good little sci-fi movie. This is the kind of thing you can watch on the couch with some friends and just enjoy. I thought it had great special effects and a good story. The character of the alien was a little creepy, but not too bad.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie during the summer. I saw it at a movie theater. It wasn't my favorite movie but it's a great movie. It's a family. It has a family that is just trying to live a life and keep a roof over their heads. There is a movie being filmed about them and they are a good family that has a lot of good humor and good acting. I love this movie. I recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the 80's and a fan this comedy movie that has good acting, good humor, and good family.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. It was entertaining and had a lot of great scenes and humor, but the story didn't really captivate me. The pacing was great and the film was enjoyable, but I found it lacking in a story. I think it is one of those movies where the script and story were just right for a PG movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this a few weeks back and I liked it a lot. The movie is based on a novel by David Baldacci which I found to be quite good. It has some nice moments. The characters are interesting and there is a real mystery to be solved and I found it to be a very good thriller. The pace is good and there are no dull parts.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - The first time I watched this movie I thought it was a rip-off of "The Black Scorpion"   A movie based on a novel written by a British author, Robert E. Howard. The movie had a bit of a rough start, and did not really make any lasting impression, however the story, acting, and writing were all very good.   My main complaint about this movie is the ending, which I think did not come off as well as it should have.  If you like a good story, a good acting performance, and an exciting adventure you will probably like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most underrated movies I've seen in a long time is the 1985 John Carpenter horror/romance, "The Thing".   The movie is so good, you could play it like a jazz album or a horror movie.   It's a little odd that I've watched this movie so much when it comes to it being released in such a limited release and low budget.  It was released to a general audience in a very short run time and has become more popular than some of the other Carpenter movies.  For anyone not familiar with this film, a man awakens from his cryogenic sleep only to be attacked by a tentacled creature from another planet.  The film follows the character, John Crichton, as he tries to save his wife from a tentacle monster only to find that the monster is really a human.  Once the movie starts, you see the director's vision come to life in a fantastic fashion.  As the monster attacks, the camera moves from one horror movie to the next in a blur.  You feel this movie in your guts and find yourself looking for every little piece of information.  While this movie isn't a masterpiece, it's a very good film to watch and one that will make you feel all kinds of things.  To this day, I'm sure that many people still think the film is a movie from the future and that they should watch this film because it's different.  One other thing that makes this film special is the performances.  Not only do the actors do a great job with their roles, but the score is great and reminds you of Carpenter's other films.  There are so many great moments in this film that will have you wanting to watch it again and again.  And if you can get a copy of this film on VHS, then you must see it.  If you are a fan of movies like "Re-Animator", "The Fog", and "Poltergeist", you'll love this movie. The Thing Review   Movie Score   5/10   Director's Cut Score     8/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... I would like to add to a number of comments that I have received over the past week, and a few days after I finished watching this, that I really didn't understand why so many people hated this movie.   I have seen a number  of films of this ilk before, and in some way, this was not dissimilar to many of them. It may sound like a bit of a nitpicking, but after watching the film, I believe I can understand why it was so harshly condemned. The film is set in a small town, in New England, and takes place after the second world war. In the beginning of the film we are taken to a place where the residents are not exactly happy about a recent development in the community, in which the town school is now run by a non-Catholic religious organisation called the Friends of Mercy.  The film deals with a number themes that I would have to mention at length, but to summarize them briefly: - The role of religion in a secular society is very much a hot button issue - The film follows the plight of two children in a family that has become more and more devout - There are very strong and disturbing scenes with child sex abuse that are not very well hidden - The character of a Christian Scientist is a sad and deeply disturbed person - There is a disturbing scene with the rape of an underage girl at one of the schools.  Perhaps the most striking element in this film is the portrayal of a small rural town.  While most small towns, especially in the United States have had their fair share of problems with social issues, this town, and particularly its religious leaders, seem to be more worried about how they are perceived by the wider world, and more focused on their own self-righteousness.  It is easy to see that it is all about the self-importance of these people, and not about the well being of the people, although that is true, but perhaps because the town has been such a target of ridicule, and the film seems to come full circle, with all the elements that made the town so reviled.  This film was not very long, and only lasted about two hours, but it is a very slow film, and one that I could not help but feel was quite sad.  When you consider the way in which it was portrayed, and how many of its characters seemed to have been painted from the same brush, you realise that this was an ugly

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know a lot about the story and characters, I'm not going to give a review on that either but I thought it was a nice movie to watch on my way home from work after a busy weekend at the theatre. I didn''t enjoy it as much as it started, I didn'T like the villain, he felt like a lazy asshole and a dick, there were some good moments, like the opening shot of the movie and the opening credits (the song was great) but when things got bad (and they got really bad) it felt like it was just so bad it's hard to watch. I liked the acting in the movie, some good actors and the special effects were pretty good, some people say it has to be seen in 3D but I really liked the look of the film, the style is nice, I liked watching the movie over and over again and found myself getting into it with the first viewing, I think it's one of those movies that's easy to enjoy once and then watch again, and once again when you watch it over and again and find yourself falling in love, I guess I''m not a fan of bad movies, but I''d say this movie would make a great gift for a horror fanatic, and the whole thing is really creepy, you could watch this movie over a dozen times and it would not get old.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a great fan of the Harry Potter series and it's many spinoffs. I was never a huge fan of Rowling's first books so I wasn't too excited about the series, but then I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and fell in love. I really hope that JK Rowling keeps making new books. This new book was much better than the first one. I think I have finally been introduced to a truly complex character. There were some interesting twists and turns in the story, but that was about all I really cared about. I do think it is a little slow but I was actually entertained by the book.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would recommend the movie to anyone that can appreciate a good story and good music. It is good for both young and old people and even children should watch it.   The story is about a man called Mr. Johnson and a woman called Mary. Mary's name is Mary-a name that is written on the wall of a house in the village of Nolangara.  The Johnson family is living there at a time when no man was to be seen in that place. When Mr. and Mrs. Johnson saw a man in a white cloth covering the wall one day they decided to have a talk about the story they told him. When they got to the part about Mary being the wife of Nokomis Johnson they had a laugh at his name.  The movie is about the journey that a woman named Mary takes by the sea to find a new life with a man named Nokomo who lives in the middle of nowhere.  When she comes to the village she is greeted by a man from the town named Nolanga, who is a simple man who wears a cloth around his head.  Mary asks him to take her back to the place where she came from and he agrees to help her. Soon after, Nolango leaves with a boy named Zoram. Zorambo is the son of a fisherman and lives in a boat. His father is so good to him that he doesn't even have to work.  When Mary gets to Nokamo's house he doesn`t recognize her but soon he is pleased by her beauty. He gives her all the things he has and she makes him a necklace of beads. Mary-as he wants to call her, decides to marry him.   The next morning Mary decides that she has had enough of Noloanjo and leaves for the village. She decides to look for her husband. Nokam follows her and she soon comes to a house where she sees a strange man.  Mary asks him the name of her husband but the man doesn`st remember. He has just been told his name and she has forgotten it too. He says that it was the man who had married Mary. Mary is a little angry but she knows that the man does not want to be married to her and that she could never find her husband if she stays in this town.  She then goes back to Nolangeara and leaves Nokoma behind. She stays
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I've seen many good horror films in my lifetime. This one stands out a little. The acting is good, and it's actually scary in a good way. It reminds me of a scary film by the original Poltergeist (1982), but it's just a little bit spooky and slightly spooky. I love when this kind of horror movie comes out and it can't hurt to see if it's worth a watch. I've already ordered the DVD.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found the movie to be an excellent watch. I was quite satisfied with the storyline. The action sequences were impressive.

The whole movie is a wonderful watch. This movie will probably make you laugh a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I've seen so far this year.   A very good movie that is very good.  Crimson Peak is an excellent and frightening horror film.  After being a part of a house party gone wrong, the female lead and her friend, a local schoolteacher (played by Milla Jovovich) end up at a haunted house where the horror begins.  This is a movie about an older woman who is trying to move on from the loss of her husband to a better life as a wife and mother.  The story is about a young man (Tom Hiddleston) who is attempting to figure out his life in a world that he was never meant to see.  I found the movie to be very frightening and very well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a really good movie from the first to the second part which are also very well directed and well acted. In the first part, we meet a man named Mr. Paul who is a detective who works in the detective division of a large police department. Mr.Paul is also a man who is very loyal to his wife whom he is very protective of. They both have a child together called a daughter named Amy (Maddie) who is the only daughter. Mr Paul has been a very good father but Amy has been his greatest joy and his wife is really protective of her. The movie starts off with Mr.P and Mr.F who are in a car accident when their car is taken over by the police. They are both arrested and charged with murder. This movie tells a story of two people who are really in love with each other, who fight their case and then at the end, there is a real happy ending for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this to be a very well-written movie with a very interesting plot. The movie was written by J.L. King and directed by George A. Romero.   A large part of the movie involves King's family being hunted down by a band of voodoo cannibals who wish to kill all voodoo witches.  A lot of the voodoo characters in the movie are pretty silly and just annoying.  As for the plot: it seems like the voodoos want to use a human sacrifice and make a deal with the devil in order to live in peace.  This part of their plot is a bit strange, but I can't fault it too much.  The plot goes very well with the main character's development.  It's very strange that this part of a movie focuses on the human sacrifice plot because it was a bit weird that a human was killed.  Although, the part in which she is captured by the canniballians is pretty interesting.  Overall, a fun movie with some interesting characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw the trailer for The Grand Budapest Hotel and I was really excited to watch the movie. I was a little nervous before the screening.   The film starts off very slowly, and is full of hints to what is to come. I didn't get as much of a grasp as I would have liked on the movie's plot, but overall, it was a good introduction to the movie and the cast of characters.  The film starts out with a scene which is reminiscent of the original film, which is perfect for the film to start off. I love how they chose to use this classic scene in the film.  The music in this film is great.  I'm glad they didn't go with a score from a real orchestra. It would have been awesome to have an orchestra playing throughout the entire movie.  In this first scene of the movie, we see the characters and we see what the movie is about.  You see a girl and a boy living together in a house that was once the home of a Hungarian Count. I am so glad that this is a film based off of a book that I found and read over and over again.  This movie has a great story line, but in some scenes I was too distracted by the actors.  When they started to introduce each character, I couldn't help but be entertained by their characters. The acting is excellent. They really look like they've been doing this acting for years.  There are a few scenes where we see some of the characters in different situations and they really look and sound like actors. I can't say enough about how good the acting is. The film moves at a slow pace. You will be really entertained throughout this film. It has a good ending that I was not expecting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very enjoyable movie.   I enjoyed it much.  It's a story about a girl with a strange and twisted mind, who can't help getting involved in a big project that's a lot more dangerous than she can possibly fathom.  This movie took me a long time to get through.  The story is quite a bit different from the previous ones.  I really liked how the movie handled a lot of the characters, especially with the girls.  And the soundtrack was really good too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got a chance to watch this film, after I read the reviews, and I think I will like it more than I thought I would. It is good, but not as good as it can be. The first 20 minutes of this film were really good. It was very nice to see a good looking woman and a bad ass man working together. I have heard that they were brothers, so that made it even better. We were both nice, and they both got what they wanted. Then the bad guy came out of nowhere and began attacking everyone. He was very well trained and not very violent, but still very bad. I guess that is because of the bad name he had as a bad guy. He made good use of a few people, like the bartender and a guy he had sex with in the bar. He did, however, break a window with a baseball bat. There was no blood, so there was no need to show it. The best part of the film was when they were at the airport and the bad guys' plane came and it was going to crash into the airport, but it didn't. The pilot made it safely, but we never saw the baddie's plane crash. All we saw was the plane land, and the guys go off to find a hotel room so they could escape. When they got to a hotel they saw that the baddies were in there, and now we were stuck watching it all happen. There were no goodbyes, no good-byes. It ended with a "good night" song. It had a nice ending, and that was the best part.   It wasn't bad, but I couldn't think of any reason to like it. It could have been made better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, it's a nice story that I really liked. The cast, especially the two leads, is a pretty good combination, but it's always nice to see the lead actors on film. I was pretty much bored out of my mind and I know I'm not alone when I say this.   I am a bit perplexed as to how this could be considered a good film. It's so bad it's good.  The two leads really don't fit together well, they both have their moments. I mean, let's be honest here, you can't have a movie about a super soldier and a cop without the cop being the only one with any kind of self respect or sense of morality.  And what are they doing when they're not trying to bust the bad guys?  They're going to dinner and the cop is just hanging out.  It's kind of like he's a celebrity whose only job is to go out and bang a lot of women.  Yeah, that's what I like about that movie, it would be great to have a guy like that on a super hero team.  But it's not like they get along, they're always going to hate each other, but what they're going through can't be that bad because they're just super soldier types who want to do what they do best.  Well sure, there are lots of bad guys to fight and plenty of explosions to see, but at least there are some good guys like the cop and the super soldier who are doing their job.  There are even some nice things about the ending and it was nice to have some closure, but I'm really bummed it wasn't over after the second act. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of other people, I've been waiting to watch this movie for many years. I can tell that a lot has changed in the world since I was a kid, but I'm still as excited as a schoolgirl to see how this young man and the woman from his life get along together.   The movie is set in a small town called Westchester, New York, in the 1940's.  The town's mayor, Joe Zuger, is a wealthy real estate developer who's been trying to develop this village for years but hasn't been able to because of the people who live there. So one day, while he's doing some business in the town, a mysterious woman dressed in a white silk dress (her name is Christine) walks into the store where he works. A local man named Jack gets very excited about the woman and decides that he wants to marry her.  There's more to Christine than meets the eye.  She's also the daughter of the town's sheriff, Mr. C. Zugers, the same sheriff who's also been trying for years to get her a home of her own.  But her father has his own problems, and Joe Zoger's plans don't exactly mesh with Mr. Zugs' vision for the village.  Christine and Joe also run into each other again when the man from the movie, who happens to be a neighbor to Mr. and Mrs. Zuckers, meets them.  As a movie, I think this film is pretty good. I like that Mr. & Mrs. Krakow have an interest in making Christine's life a little more pleasant and that Christine's mother makes it clear to everyone in town that Christine is her daughter and it's time for her to be treated like a real girl.  Another interesting thing is that this movie doesn't seem to have an end. The film ends not with a cliffhanger, like so many films of the era did, but with a very happy ending. It's also really great to see that the movie was made in 1940, as it's been years since anyone has made a movie about teenagers and it seems that the world has a lot more to learn about how teens in this era really were.  I've also read reviews that say that the plot is predictable and too predictable. In truth, I can't think of a plot that would be more predictable than the plot of this movie.  It's pretty

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very entertaining little film about a young boy who gets his parents to let him go out to a beach to play and then finds himself getting lost in the water with a bunch of little boys playing in the surf.   The only problem I had with this film was that there weren't too many jokes in it.  I think I saw about seven jokes in the entire film, and that isn't something I was too impressed with.  My son loves this film!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an American, and I'm a huge fan of horror movies. I'm no stranger to cheap horror flicks, but never have I seen a movie like this before!   The story is absolutely brilliant and I didn't expect anything less.     "This is not a scary movie." That's what a reviewer said. You can't have a decent movie if your story isn't terrifying. The acting is top-notch too, especially the role of the killer, but I'm getting ahead of myself.    The killer himself, Frank is a real hottie. He looks so sexy in the movie, especially in his underwear. This makes his death more shocking. The scene where he eats a baby is pretty darned disturbing and I can't get enough of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first 3 minutes of this movie are the most entertaining part of the movie. The first half is a lot like "Jaws" with the water getting closer and closer to the boy as he swims away, the water gets closer and more violent to the point of the boy feeling it's life threatening. When the boy gets to the end of the river he begins to go to the surface, then the boy grabs a little rock out of the water, this rocks gives him the ability to make out things and hear the river and water.   This is followed by a pretty good story. The story of the little boy and his friends that are about to start swimming lessons. It has a decent length of the film and although the boy is very small in height and build he is able to make the most of his time swimming the water. This movie has a really interesting story, but this time around the story is about a little boy with a little brother named Tommy, it was a real joy to see how they would grow up together, it's also nice to see the two older brothers, who were not able to go swimming, they had to learn to swim together. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has not seen it, especially if you like a good story to go with a good action movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all honesty, this movie did a fine job at being a fun romp. I'm usually not a fan of romances that are about a girl who can transform into a wolf like animal but this movie managed to keep up with the jokes and not let it get to a ridiculous point. And for what it is, the movie was a lot of fun. If you like cheesy comedy, you will enjoy this. If not, don't bother. If, however, you are a fan for a movie that has a lot more to offer than a simple rom-com then give it a try.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The second movie from the original "Ghostbusters" was always supposed to be a campy affair with only two lead actors and three supporting stars, and, indeed, this one has many funny lines.    There are more comedy elements in this movie than there are in the others, but they don't all play off each other, and there are still too many silly moments to take seriously.  The movie's main gimmick is to have a bunch of ghostbusters go to an apartment building that's full of traps to find a ghostly girlfriend (played by Jane Curtin). The plot has a lot of fun, but it's never very deep, and the movie never makes me laugh.  There is a pretty bad scene with the girl who lives there, and her sister (who happens to be played by a really annoying little girl).   This movie is a waste of the original's talents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I've been a fan of the Star Trek series for a long time. This movie is a very good adaptation of the original series. I liked the movie very much but the plot had a lot to do with being a 'Star Trek fan'. You know, those old ones where Kirk was trying to save the human race from destruction. The movie was fun to watch with some interesting scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Lives in a big house (a.k.a. an apartment) with his brother and sister, his mother, two of his sisters, and their mom. He has a crush on his mom's younger sister, so one day he meets her, and she's a lovely lady, so when they decide to get married he agrees. After they get married, he takes over her room, and he decides to use her for sex. But when he takes a shower one day, he sees that something is very wrong about her... she has this weird habit of changing the water in the tub to a much thicker and stronger-tasting water than she normally uses, even on her regular showers." This is about one of the worst things that I have ever seen in a movie. My friends and I (I can't remember how we found out about this, we didn't know the title of the film) watched this movie with a friend who doesn't know very much about sex, and we were not expecting this. This is really bad. There is so much gross, disgusting sex. Not a single moment where a girl is "getting into it". In the beginning of the movie, it seems like all of the girls are having a good time, which makes us wish there would be more sex... but then, the next movie... well, we don't even want to go to the bathroom! The ending is awful, too bad for this poor girl! She ends up getting stuck in her bathroom and has to be rescued by a maid, but that's it. This movie should not be allowed to be on television, or anywhere! It's so bad!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would give this movie a 10-year rating (and a higher one if I were to say so), but for the moment I can't think of a better one that fits this genre. It's like a cross between a movie about a girl who takes care of the homeless in the streets of NYC and an adaptation of a novel about a boy who finds his place as a dog-sled driver on a remote island off the coast of Spain.   A nice cast of characters (most of whom aren't human in this universe) with strong roles played by all of them (except perhaps the little girl with a strange accent).   The soundtrack is amazing.  I think it was the best score I have heard in a movie that I liked since the original (although I loved it too). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is really good:  A woman has a child and takes a job as a stay at home mamma of a couple who is expecting a child. She finds that things are not what they seem. They start having sex and things go bad. But that's not all: she gets pregnant.   It is a movie that you will find yourself watching a lot. I'm just sad that I have never heard of a film like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie, I laughed out loud a few times. The story behind the movie is awesome and I liked that it was a story about a guy that was an expert in many crafts. He was hired as a builder for a man that had an old castle in the woods. It was built by him with help from some local kids that had no idea what they were doing. But, they still succeeded in the end.   This movie has a few parts that I enjoyed. The first part is about the builder, what is his deal? He is a man with the skills and knows where to get them. The second part, the kids are a little crazy and do a lot of stupid stuff and make a lot more mistakes. But at the end, they finally get something right. The kids do some tricks that are very funny and they are so happy. The third part is a girl who is the next girl that is to join the castle. But... she is pretty dumb and does a lot wrong. But what I really liked about this movie is when the builder was building the castle, he was building it in the old ways. This is because he was trying to pass them off as the new way, which was a bad idea. The last part is when he comes out and tells the kids to build something with him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was definitely something that we would like to see as a movie on Friday afternoon. Although, I'm not sure we would find it appealing because it was a short film, not a great film by any means. The film was a little bit of a short on my rating of 9/10 because of it's short length.

I was so excited about seeing this movie but it was so much better than expected. It was very funny, funny at times, and at others it was extremely interesting. I could not put it down. It's a very good movie and I would like to see this movie a few more times. The music was great, the acting was great and the writing was good. A great movie and a great time with the guys.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like horror movies about monsters, the first movie in the series, Monster House, is a good one. This movie, which has a more serious approach to the genre and is directed by a horror genius, Richard Donner, shows the classic monster movies on a more somber and realistic scale. In that regard, it's a better movie than Frankenstein, the monster that was the first to feature a monster as the main character in a horror movie.   It has some of the best special effects ever, especially the work in which the monster is placed in a coffin.  If this movie were made in the 1930s, it would have been a huge hit with all of us who were old enough to appreciate horror movies from that time.  I'd also like to add that the monster, a giant frog-like creature who has been cursed by a powerful witch, is played by a very talented young actor (who is actually a little girl).   For those of you who like science fiction and are a fan of the original Frankenstein movie, you'll be right at home in this one.  In addition, there are some great little touches that make this movie so enjoyable, such as the fact that in the middle of the movie the main characters are shown walking down a hallway with an open door, but at the end, they have a little conversation while looking at each other in the eye.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good thing about watching an episode of the original Star Trek   The bad thing about the original   For a fan of Trek, the original series   has a lot of things to offer: interesting characters, good music, and a good sci-fi plot.   At its core, the first season is a Trek story about a crew in space who discover a mysterious planet, which has some unusual properties. A very basic plot is presented by the characters and some other aliens: "The planet's sun is a giant, star-forming sun with no atmosphere." "The sun has four moons, each of which is a normal planetary body, except that they orbit it in a similar way to Earth." "They are normal planets, except they have a life of their own." And so on.  I like this basic premise: "we are aliens from another planet, so why are we on Earth?" This is a very good premise, even if it's a tad simplistic at times. The basic premise is also a little clunky, but this isn't a bad thing because there are some strong episodes (and a couple of very good ones), and there are many good characters. The main character of the first story arc is called Trelane, and he has some rather interesting traits. First off, he is not a member of the crew of the USS Enterprise, and when the ship encounters the planet, he and his crew are rather skeptical about what they are seeing: "they were strange, alien objects, the color of metal, the shape of a mushroom."  This is the first of many hints that Trelana may not be a very nice person. Secondly, his crew have been on the planet for about three days, and have never seen anything remotely like it: "They didn't seem to notice anything peculiar about it." He has a different take on the situation. "There was something odd about the planet. Something about it was off, and something that was not so odd."  Trela's first impressions of the planet are rather negative: "I'd never seen a planet like this before."  His second impression is more positive: "Something interesting about the people." Trelan becomes more and more enamored with the planet over time. "They seemed to be very normal."  He also meets the people of the other planet, the Trelans, and learns about their life.  They don't seem like

I was hoping the girl wouldn't end up like a dog but I wasn't disappointed. This movie has a happy ending, but not as happy as a dog or a cat! I found the ending to be more like a happy cat, or cat in heat. But still a happy movie.   Thanks to the author of this blog, you can check out a copy on YouTube.  (Source: Youtube)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Pulp Fiction" is the epitome of a great movie, with many of the original movie's elements and a few added elements added to spice up the experience.   You get the usual "street" violence, "cool" people (especially John Travolta), a little bit of horror, and good, solid plot.  This was a fun film to watch; the violence is quite realistic, but not in a gritty way (which is to be expected from a film about a group of friends on a killing spree), and the plot is very good, with enough character development (particularly for one of the movie's villains).   One of the most important things about this film is that it's such a good, low budget movie that it will never be "cheap" to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My god, was I ever glad to be a member of the "Vampire Family".   This is a very unique and interesting film in many ways.   Although some things were a little out of place, it wasn't boring at all.  At times I felt like I was watching something from a horror movie.  The ending made me cry.  There were also some good action scenes.  For a movie about vampires, the cast was great and the story is very unique. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As with any other film about the War Between the States the film follows this well thought out script to an extent.   Although it is a war film in the sense that it focuses on the battles of the War it never really leaves the battlefield.  A good script and well balanced script all round.  The only downside was that the film was not well received by the American War Room in the UK.  What annoyed the Americans at the time was that as soon as the battle was over the soldiers were allowed to go home.  I think this would have worked better as a part 2 to the film.  While the film does have a couple of interesting and important scenes it also suffers from a lack of characterisation.  Again it is in the war at the end of the war that we get to see the best of the soldiers.  This is where the film is at it's best but it does feel that this was filmed when the war was a bit older.  There is a very interesting cast here and if this film had a third part to it it would be even more successful.

A good movie which does not forget about the characters, especially the bad ones like the girl who is stupid like a rabbit and always has to do things by herself, she always has a big problem to solve, but she does not.  For a comedy, there are a lot of jokes, very well made.  The main character is good, she is just a bit stupid and stupid like that.  She has a bad time with the police, her father always blames the police and always wants to take her away.  I like this movie very much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's about a dog who's trying to survive the apocalypse.   From what i've seen, the trailer looked like a really good idea.  The movie has a simple plot, but not to boring to watch.  There were moments where i thought it would take a while to get going, but it never did.  It has a decent cast of actors to work with.  As a dog it's no wonder it is hard to take on an apocalypse and survive.  I loved that the dog was constantly getting in trouble, which was a really nice change of pace.  Overall i liked this movie, it's not the best dog movie but if you are looking for a good apocalyptic dog movie i highly recommend checking this one out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The director of this movie has a great sense of humor. He's got a great personality and his characters are a lot of fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most impressive feature of this film is its portrayal of a great, and not very famous man, who made a huge impression on me when I saw him in the first film. In the second film, I was much more disappointed in him.   When I first saw him again, he looked so much older! This could have been fixed with a little more attention, but I did not see the way in which the film played out.  The main character, who is an artist, seems a little over the top. He talks to himself in a very monotonous voice and when he makes a painting, it doesn't do very much.  He is also a bit of a buffoon and I can see the whole of his body, but nothing comes out of it.  This is a very slow film and I don't see anything interesting happening at all!   There is a funny scene in the house where an elderly lady comes and talks to him in his own room.  But at the end of the film, the lady gets her dress ripped off, and is a mess!  I don;t remember her name!  This movie is very hard to believe and I find it a little silly.  I would like to see a remake of this!

Now I consider myself a historical buff and my students are historians as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. Not just because it was a sci-fi flick but also because it had a really good plot. It kept you interested throughout the entire movie and I think that is a good thing to do. It had a decent story and it's a good action movie that made me look forward to the next one. I love the futuristic feel to it. I liked how the director used the sci-fiction elements to really make the movie seem sci-fier. If only a little more could have been done to make it more sci-y.   If you have a big screen you can watch this one at home or on a smaller TV. I also would like to point out that the people who said it had boring plot were either blind or just don't know what it is about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen a movie as bad as this one. It is one of those films that you can't help but laugh at the absurd and ridiculous things the characters do. In the end, it is a great comedy about a bunch of kids who do ridiculous things in order to make money so they can buy their own cars. The movie is about an unemployed guy who works at a gas station who gets to hang out with his friend Mike who is really a wimp and they go on a lot of adventures that involve drinking, drugs and smoking pot. This is a pretty standard teen comedy so you might expect the acting to be bad at times, but I don't think this is a bad movie. It might be slightly funny but it is nothing you haven't seen before. It would have been a great movie for kids to watch in the early 80's or if you want a simple teen comedy to watch. The music was alright and it never really stood out. It isn't bad, but it isn't a great film either.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm usually not a big fan of this genre, mostly because it can be hard to be believable with a character that keeps running away in his/her car.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a bit like a musical on the moon. We have the moon as the protagonist. It doesn't take him to the moon, but it takes him to a planet called Earth, and then on to the Earth's moon, the moon of Jupiter. It's like a dance on the Earth moon. If you are a fan of the movie, and I was, then it is very, very, aint very nice. However, if you want to see a science fiction film, and if you don't mind a little bit of silly humor, then you will like it.   The thing that I liked most about this movie, was the comedy of it. There is a kind of humor in this movie. It is sort of like a cross between The Smothers Brothers and the music from "It's a Wonderful Life."   If you don´t like comedies, you will not like it either. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't usually rate a movie after only a single viewing, but I'm giving the film 4 stars because it's still a good popcorn flick.   The movie has two characters named Dave and George. Dave is a middle aged man who likes to get drunk. He has a wife, Lisa, who also gets drunk quite a bit. When Dave has one drink too many he becomes a very obnoxious drunk. But one drink doesn't take away the badness of a whole night of bad behavior. He is caught by his brother and his friend, Frank. They force Dave to go to a country bar where he finds the only place to get a girl, a bartender named Susan.  And she is also drunk. It's a slow and strange affair. And after two drinks they force the two to get married. So when they get married they get the next one and the next and then they get drunk until they go back home. So this is where the problems really begin.  Dave does not seem to be able to change. He drinks too much and he's obnoxious. He doesn't seem to have any morals. He's in love with a beautiful woman, Susan, that looks a lot like his wife. But Susan is also a complete drunk. So she's also a very annoying drunk. And when she leaves her drunken husband and the family, she leaves the family with no one who can guide them.  So here comes Dave's next drinking problem.  It's his daughter who has a lot of problems. She has an abusive step-father and her mother's alcoholic.  But when she gets drunk and takes her own life, Dave does nothing to save her. And he's angry at his step-dad.  After that, things get worse. Dave finds out that he has AIDS.  This means that he won't be able reproduce. It makes him a horrible person.  The ending was a little disappointing.  I thought it was too neat.  As far as the film is concerned, it is a good, bad and very very very bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very, very good movie!   As soon as I heard about this movie I was on a high - I had heard so many good things about it and was really excited about seeing it.   I also was amazed at how good the actors were. I was so glad to see a movie that I thought would be a great movie.  And, yes, the first act is a little cheesy but it's not too bad.  The main character is a guy who has been kicked out of his parents house. He is homeless, on the street, trying to make a living. He becomes a drug dealer by stealing and selling marijuana.  One night the guys who live across the street come by looking for money. They do so by killing two people and trying to sell the weed.  He is a real badass, and that's what I liked most about him.  It doesn't matter if you like a real person or a movie character - if you can root for the guy who wants to make some money, you will like this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited about this movie, i really wanted to see it since i watched the trailer. i went in with a bit of trepidation but i was pleasantly surprised. this movie was very exciting to watch and it had an interesting story. i really liked it.   The first part of the movie is actually a flashback. when we first meet the guys in the bar, they are going about their normal day. a guy named Johnny has a problem with his boss and gets put on leave. while he is gone, a girl named Susan (who is played by jill from jill & stu) makes a pact with him that if she can make him forget about his problems and keep him in a better mood, she would let him go. after awhile, Susan starts going on about how she wants to make him happy. Johnny is a bit skeptical, but he follows the promise of Susan and it works. i like to think that she is a little bit of an angel who has a mission and she is willing to do anything to make Johnny happy. but then things get a little twisted, when Johnny and Susan go off to the town where they first met, Johnny starts to have a flashback to the girl who he really liked. it seems that they really do have a connection. Susan tries to keep things from Johnny, but eventually Johnny starts making some mistakes and Susan tries her best to get Johnny to stop his problems. the movie was good. it made me feel that there is something a little strange going on. it is a good story and i liked the characters and the story.

The character of "Joey" (David Carradine) is very well done, as are the other people he meets along the way. This movie shows that the power of one person is tremendous. There is nothing you can do to stop this.

In a way, I'd say this is like watching the old "Dr. Who" serials with the actors in tuxedos.  Also, I'm a sucker for the idea of a guy who has a giant robot that can do some really cool things.  The story is really interesting, with a lot of twists and turns.  I found the characters to be really well acted, but they don't have any depth.  There is really nothing special about any one character.  What I do like is that the robots really look cool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a couple who is living in the country and who have to keep a job in order to eat and to make enough money to have the house they live in repaired. The movie was good because it had a little humor and lots of suspense. I would recommend it to everyone who like a good old western.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not even an atheist, but I am a skeptic, and the last few years I've seen so many great films about the supernatural. I would have to say that "The Conjuring" is my favorite. It's a great horror-thriller.   From the beginning I loved the film. The whole thing was fantastic and creepy and the pacing was great. From the opening scene I could sense a bit of a supernatural aspect to the film, but it was subtle. Then, when the creepy old woman showed up, my interest was peaked. I didn't know what to make of the woman at first, but that changed once she moved on to the boy in the room. It made me realize how creepy she was and how much she frightened the boy. I was sure that something was going to go wrong. But once it happened, I didn the really wanted to see how it all worked out.  This is a classic, it's hard to explain to someone who doesn't like horror. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Fascinating! I love to read about the past and try to guess how the world would look if we lived it all again. The world is a little different now, it's not as pure and pretty as when it was young and full of mystery and hope, and this movie provides that." - Alyssa I saw this as part of the "A New Hope" Trilogy (along with "Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" and "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan") at the Paramount Theatre (formerly the Century City Theatre).  It has to be said that this was a movie about the future, not the past.  We are looking back at the present day in the year 2012 (when the movie takes place).  In the film, the good guys of the future (known as the Galactic Empire) are the ones doing the bad things in the story.  This is due to the fact that the evil people of the past (known in this movie as "Rebels") have come back to wreak havoc and destroy all that this "new" society is trying to accomplish.  The people of 2012 (the Rebel forces) have become more "mature" than the people of 20 years ago.  But this movie does a good job of showing us the effects of that "maturation" on these characters and on the society around them.  And it is all done with humor and humanity.   This movie is a blast to watch.  It is a beautiful blend of science fiction and fantasy, with an excellent cast of characters that all seem to get along really well.  I found the movie very moving.  "Star" does a wonderful job showing the way humanity is progressing, how people are getting more and more sophisticated, but at the same time, still being human, and still seeking love.  At the end of the movie, we get an ending that is both sad and hopeful, but also makes you realize that life is still a mystery, and there is still so much to be discovered.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second feature film by Kevin Smith, and I loved it. It has a lot of similarities to Inbred with the emphasis of the main character's parents being the only ones really responsible for his actions (and there is a great amount of action in the movie). However this movie has a little more comedy thrown in with it and I thought it was a lot more funny than Inbred and I really think this movie could be a big hit.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never knew that the movie "Eyes Wide Shut" is a movie about sex.   It doesn't.  The movie "Dorothy" has nothing to do with sex. It is about love and jealousy and lust and lust.  It has to do only with sex and masturbation and to understand this movie you have to understand the main character Dorothea (Meryl Streep).   She is the main hero in this movie.  At the beginning she doesn't like anybody. She has this repulsive laugh, she doesn�t want to get up.  She has an enormous amount of jealousy and the other person thinks she is the most beautiful woman.  But after a lot of suffering she has to meet the man who will make her beautiful.  This movie is about Dorothe the main girl. Dorothe lives with her aunt. Her aunt lives next door. Her mother is away on a visit. Her father is in another town. Dorrita is really stupid. The movie is really silly, like a kid plays a stupid movie for his sister.  I would never want to see a movie like that in real life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a great little horror movie.   While the whole thing is kind of odd (as is always the case with a horror movie) the movie is still a great horror movie which takes place in a very small town.  The story is a bit strange at first, the town's residents seem like ordinary people, but they don't seem normal at all.  As the story goes on, people start turning up missing.  Then, someone starts telling a story about a man who used to have a little boy, and now he has an entire town filled with little boys, so he doesn't have to do anything anymore.  A mysterious entity that is stalking the town (or some town I don't remember) seems to be making sure the boy will not return to the human world.  Some people do find their way back, though.  So, while the film is a little strange at the start, once you understand what is going on it becomes a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I think it was about a group of four friends that were all in their 20s, and some of the stuff that they were watching was the best and most adventurous stuff, including some of them had never been in a film theater."    It's the second to last film in the trilogy, and the final movie in the series as a whole.   I was so excited to see this movie at the cinema!   Although it was disappointing not to see the film in 3D, I still enjoyed the whole experience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of The Dark Knight Rises is an epic tale of the destruction of an empire and a great battle.

A good story but no action scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of the action movie "The Avengers" I can see some very interesting ideas and some really great action, but the screenplay is just not good at all. The screenplay is not good because it is not very good at writing. I like a lot the action, I like the special effects, and it all works great for the movie, but it is really boring at times. I would not say there is any great ideas or special effects. They really are just not worth it, and they are not that bad either. The way they are set up is great, but they are so over used. The plot is very lame, and the characters are so one note that they are really only there to be a way to move the plot along quickly. I mean, come on, how many times have we seen a group of Avengers, with a special "force" attached to them? How many times are we supposed to see them? They are only in this movie to run away from a battle between their respective teams. Well, that is not the best plan. There is no reason to see it except for the fact that it is the first Avengers movie and to show how they work together, what powers they have, and how the teams react. That is the only reason I could see. As a whole, I can't recommend this movie, it is bad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie and will probably watch it again sometime because it is a very good movie.   You have a good group of guys that seem to be very normal and not crazy as I found out.  The main story is not as interesting as I was expecting but is still a good film to watch.  It is a good comedy movie that has some good laughs.  I liked the main character as he had a good time and that is about all I can say about it.

This is a much better movie than Star Wars: Episode I and Episode II (which are my two favorite Star Wars movies) because they had lots of different aliens and more action than this movie did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a long time i thought that the movie was made in the late 70s and the film was a remake of a film about a big city guy who wants to see a "man-bear-pig" movie at the old theater but it turns out that it is an animal who was living in a zoo and he decided to come out to take revenge on the man-bear.   So this is a revenge tale but instead of going after a man-Bear-pigs the man, after learning that he has become a "bear-bear" wants to get revenge against the man who has taken his revenge against him.     The acting is a little lackluster especially in the first and second act but then again i think that if the director wants to show what kind of character is the "man bear-pigg" then he should have cast Robert Redford in the role of the hero. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "What can you do?" I am a huge fan of the original films (and the sequels) and this is the best of them. The original film is about a small town that has become a ghost town. The movie is very clever in using some of the same old tropes that many old horror movies use but without using the same cheesy ways. The characters are interesting and have a sense of humor that works well. The acting is great and there are some great scenes throughout the movie. The cast is all great, but the best is a little voice from the sky that makes you think twice about everything that you are about to do. The ending is perfect. This movie was worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie a lot.       It has some beautiful music, a nice setting, good characters and the story is well told.  My only complaint is that it seems to make a big deal about a "spirit" who shows up in a movie and then dies.  In my opinion, what a strange way to go about a movie!   This movie had a lot of tension for a first act, but the plot didn't work.  I enjoyed it though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about the end of an era - I thought it was a very interesting movie about a bunch of characters who were all working on different projects and they all had their own things going on. Each one had their very own problems and that made me really like them all. The movie itself wasn't too bad and I was a little disappointed when they gave up on the movie. A movie like this should be so much better than it is - I loved the movie and I will definitely watch the next one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, the movie itself is not bad. The premise was cool and I was just happy it was made. I loved the movie! But what was the point? I mean, what was he doing there in the first place? He's dead now.   I've watched a lot of science fiction and I've never seen anything like this. I'd really like to see it on a big screen. It's got great effects and it is a nice watch. I wish they had included a scene about the whole "Cargo Cult" thing (although I don't think it would have made any difference, since it didn't matter at all when the crew arrived anyway). I can't see a single reason why the aliens are so popular with the crew (if that's even true).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie in the summer of 2003 when I was in high school.    After I saw it I thought it was hilarious and great.  The movie is all about a high school senior who wants to go to Europe for one month.  I don't think any of us would go to a foreign country for that amount of time, so we would not be able to see everything this movie has to offer.  He wants to come up with a way to get to Europe and the first way he thought of was to just drive to Italy.  This is where the movie takes a turn into the real comedy.  They are trying to drive to the nearest airport.  It is very obvious that they didn't care for Italy and did not try to learn how to drive.  But it is not the Italian people's fault.  When the car does not start a passenger opens the back door to turn on the car and then they realize that the car has a flat tire.  So the passenger takes off his clothes and puts them inside the tire, and then all they have to do is pull the tire out and they can drive to town.  We never see the passenger get into the car with the driver, and it is only when the car stops to get gas that they finally get into it.  By this point they are almost to the airport and are still trying to figure out the best way to leave.  However, they do learn that in Italy, the way to a country is a motor bike.  Then they get the best Italian man that they can find, and they are on their way.  And by far one of the best movie endings ever.  At the airport a kid asks the man, who is trying to get into a taxi, what he is doing, and the man says he just wants to get his life together.  There is a good reason why you are seeing people trying to run around trying to find the shortest route.  You have all these people that want to travel to Europe, but no one knows how to get there.  All the funny moments come from the people trying not to get out of the car before they run out of gas, the passengers getting in the car because they are all naked, and not knowing how to find a gas station.  Some great one liners come from these people.  As they are driving through Italy, one of them says to the driver "How can you be a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I saw "Z" I was a little bit upset by its violent scenes. In "Z", a young man, Michael (David Carradine) is at a party. He is playing music and watching movies. In one of the movies, his eyes are injured by a glass jar which is filled with some kind of liquid. He becomes paranoid that people around him are trying to kill him. The next night, he is at the same party. However, his paranoia becomes much worse and he is terrified of the others. He runs out of the house and into the forest. He sees a man with a large gun, who is following him. They both run into a cave and both are killed. The police arrive and Michael's father tells the policeman that his son is the "madman." The policeman doesn't believe the story. He tells Michael's brother George (David Keith) and his sister Karen (Carol Burnett) to look for clues to find out who killed Michael and where. Michael's uncle Henry (Robert Duvall) is the first one to find the man and he also finds a gun. Karen looks into the barrel and sees that the blood is orange. Karen finds the woman who took Michael to the forest and they find the bottle of liquid which the man was using to kill Michael. She uses a lighter to set the bottle on fire. She and her uncle go back into the house. Karen goes out to find some clothes and the brother and sister decide to leave the house because they don't want Michael to know. Karen tells the brother to go in and get George and Karen while they stay to look at the bottle. Karen's husband, Walter (John Astin), returns from work and is upset about what has happened. Karen sees him coming and calls for him to come out of his room. Walter does not understand what is happening. Walter then goes into the room and finds Karen dead on the floor. Karen had been strangled. Walter runs out into the hallway and is killed by a bullet. Karen runs into the hall where Walter's body is. Walter is found on the bed. He has a knife in his hand. He then leaves the house as Walter. Walter meets another man and is murdered. He was trying to get George to return to the house where he lived. Walter asks his brother George if he has come back. George says he has gone somewhere. Walter tries to figure out where he has went. He calls up

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are two things you need to know about this movie. First, if you like a movie that has an ending that will have you crying uncontrollably, then this movie is for you. If not, then you need a vacation. I got the feeling that they were all on vacation at this movie, like that is a bad thing.   When you can't stop yourself from watching a bad movie: What a disappointment this movie was! The story is boring at best, and the writing is awful, but this is a good looking movie, and it made me laugh.  I don't think this movie would make a great film: I have heard the ending of this movie has been changed from the original, and I hope this is true.  I would recommend the movie to any fans of bad movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie.   There are only two scenes in the whole movie that were extremely well written (although the latter one is a bit of a head scratcher to those who aren't used to "tense" scenes).   The first one is an extremely interesting scene that takes place in a hospital.  It's a scene between two police officers that is about as tense as a scene can be.  The other scene is an incredibly creepy scene in which one of the characters is being stalked by a monster.  I liked both scenes, and there is a certain kind of horror film about to emerge from this one.  A solid first movie in the "Monster Trilogy" of monster movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was fun! The movie, like some of the movies from this genre, takes place in the early 1900's. This time the villain is a famous vampire. I like this movie because of the fun that this movie has. A little girl is a vampire and that is cool. The scene where the girl is walking through town with a basket of eggs and a basket filled with apples is pretty good. The vampire gets eaten by a horse and the horse gives a nice ride. The girl is about to eat a small boy and the boy asks if she likes apples. The little boy asks her if she is hungry. The movie is a lot like some vampire movies from the 60's. However I'm surprised that they did not use a real vampire, but instead made a vampire out of a little girl. It's pretty cool. It was fun to watch the little girl eat the horse, and not being afraid of death (not sure if this was intended or not) I liked watching this movie. I think that I will enjoy this movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason I like this movie is that it does so many things very well, especially the performance of the two main actors. This movie is about a man who comes back from the war to find his family all dead. He is then haunted by his son's ghost and the spirit of his sister. They haunt him, he can't sleep and then he goes off to find an old guy that has lost his family to a car crash.   There are so many interesting characters that have been forgotten by history. One of the best characters is a lady that tells him she can see ghosts. She also makes him watch a bunch of bad horror movies, so there is some really good bad horror in this movie. The movie has some good horror scenes, but there are some really horrible scenes as well. This is a movie that is worth seeing for the first time and the second time as well if you want to see how good horror movies can be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have never watched a Star Wars movie, don't waste your time on this one, unless you have a thing for space battles and bad acting.   The movie begins with an epic battle between the Galactic Empire and a rag-tag Rebel force.  The Empire has just won a major victory against the Rebels and they are celebrating.  As a child in the late '70's, I remember watching Star Wars and thinking that the Rebels were a bunch of stupid cowards and the Empire was a cool, sophisticated and noble force, even if it did sometimes kill innocent civilians and destroy the planet.  I grew up and became a fan of the franchise.  Star Wars is now considered to be the greatest science fiction movie ever made and a modern classic.  Although I was a fan from my childhood, I was very surprised by this movie.  It is not a perfect movie, but the movie is not bad, at all.  A number of minor problems do plague the movie, namely the bad acting, the terrible dialogue (some of the dialogue is so bad that the movie itself could be considered anti-climatic), the plot that lacks a logical flow and a few other minor problems.  Despite these minor faults, it is still one of the best Star Wars films ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of those movies where you can't even describe it. What it is:  The movie takes place in an unnamed city in an unspecified country of the present. The city is called Kure and it is inhabited by various people, the most common being humans and animals. It also includes various animals of the wild and other kinds of creatures. In order to live in this city one must pay a lot of money, not always by cash but also by food and other commodities. Many people are forced to be on the streets because of the high crime rate, which is made worse by the lack of good jobs for the poor and by the inability to find decent work because of all the slums. A young woman is forced by circumstances to work at the hotel that is owned by one of the wealthiest people in the city. Her real problem is that she is extremely lonely and she feels lonely, because she lives in a big house but she has very few people around.  There are a few others like her and they all share their own little world. There is also a guy named Mitsuha, a student in one of her classes. She meets him in a park and she ends up falling in love with him. She is not aware of this love because she is very young and inexperienced. She begins to use drugs to cope with the loneliness and she becomes a very violent and violent person, but she does not realize this because she does drugs to feel better about herself.   The movie makes us love Mitsu. She loves to do drugs and to kill, to cause harm to others, to make others suffer. Her addiction is a gift, which she needs to give herself in order to get a high, but there is a price to be paid. We need to watch this movie, because it is a beautiful love story that is full of tenderness and hope.  This is an outstanding movie that has a powerful message about the problems of the rich and poor, the weak and strong.

It is one thing to enjoy a film like "The Shawshank Redemption" but quite another to watch "The Shatner Shuffle" with friends.  While the story may be simplistic, the actors, the set design and the special effects all combine to make the picture one of the funniest movies you will see this year.  To think that a picture like this has come from a movie theatre in Toronto in the 60's.

It is so funny and makes you laugh your butt off but then there is also something about it that makes it a very thought provoking one. I have seen it before on TV when it was a comedy show and I think they have improved on their comedy but the one thing that i can't stand about the movie is the ending. When it started I thought it was funny and then it seemed that something wasn't funny about it. I'm not a comic person so this isn't to my taste but I loved it and I'm looking forward to the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the year 2000 a lot of stuff had happened in the film industry. One of the things that happened was that the big screen adaptations of the famous books had become pretty boring, a lot was done with too few characters and sometimes the dialogue got rather long. The first part of this movie is about a group of scientists who, while trying to solve a problem of a certain kind, get a surprise from God, in a rather unpleasant way.

During his trip, he learns about an ancient prophecy from a girl named Olga. This prophecy foretold about a planet named Dazan, where Zoltan would be reunited with his brother, only to be betrayed by the Dazans. Zoltari, a powerful alien from Dazon, is looking for Zoltat, a brother of Daz who also went to the planet.

The film is based on the book from the same name by a Russian science fiction author: The Man Who Killed Zoltaro by Aleksandr F. Zasulich.

This is just another one of those "dark" books about the secret war between two groups of people. They were all working to defend a city, and a guy is a spy for the enemy. I am not sure if there was some type of conspiracy going on, but I hope there was!   The main story line is interesting, I have read about that kind of stuff on Wikipedia before, and it seems that that's the kind of thing that happens in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.  The characters are all good, even the antagonists are likable, but that doesn't change the fact that the story is poorly told and there are a lot of unanswered questions. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      In one of the most underrated movies, John Travolta plays a former Hollywood actor who is haunted by a strange, silent figure that walks with him on the streets of New York.   This movie is so funny and well made.  Even if you have seen a lot of movies like this, you might enjoy this one more than most.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good: The story is good, the characters are funny, the plot twists are well done, the special effects are good, and the score is great. The bad: There are some bad shots in this film. The lighting is very hard to watch, sometimes in a good way, sometimes not. The soundtrack is mediocre and not memorable. It feels very "samey".   If you're a fan of the "Star Trek" franchise then this film should appeal to you.   "Star Voyage to Babel" (1979) is a great example of the science fiction genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It is not so easy to kill a man." -- Jean-Luc Godard (1964)   I loved it! This was the first I've seen that I enjoyed as much as the first, and it made me realize I'm very much a fan of the genre, and very much enjoy watching old movies! There were a few funny moments in the beginning, but it was great to see Jean-Claude Van Damme back and in a serious role, and that scene in the car where he gets shot down by the car, but keeps going is funny, because it looked like he got hit by a car, not a gun!   - August 21, 2014A good old-fashioned adventure

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie about a kid getting a job at a big-box store that is owned by the family of a mafia boss, the movie is a lot of fun. I'd have preferred it without the plot but I liked it anyway because of all the wacky things it does to set it up. The movie also has a lot to do with the kid's relationship with his mother, but that doesn't matter if it is never explained.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a woman, I couldn't get enough of this movie. It reminded me of a girl-power comedy. This movie had tons of laughs. I loved it, and I loved that the movie was about a woman. This could have been a great film about a girl that finds her true love after dating a bunch of guys. It would have been an interesting film about love and women. Instead, it was a movie that I would watch over and over again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sorry, but, to me this movie is a bit on the generic side. It's not so bad that it can't be made entertaining, but it's nothing special, and not really great either. The movie is mostly a combination of both the first season and the second season. That first season had a pretty good premise, with two characters who had to find a place to live in this small town. They have an encounter with a local girl who seems a bit odd, and are drawn into a larger mystery. The second season (I'm a bit more familiar with this second season) seems to have been left by the wayside a bit. The story feels more like the characters were simply passing through and never really sticking with one another for very long. That's not to say it's bad, it's just there's nothing memorable about it. The plot itself is pretty basic. The girls are forced to live together and solve a mystery, but that's about it really. I won't go into detail about the characters in this movie because it's pretty much what it is: characters. That doesn't make this any less interesting than most other "dramas".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was disappointed with this movie when I first watched it at a local theater. It is not as good as I remembered.   But I found it a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have not been watching movies that I feel like I can watch them for at least a couple of hours at a time as a fan for a long time.   The whole movie just seemed so fun to watch.  It was so funny to see a couple characters like the wife trying to teach her husband how to be a man, and then watching him get all angry and throw a chair across the room.  The guy at the restaurant didn't seem to be trying to get his wife back after she left, he was more focused on what a good time he had with his new friends.  I was laughing so hard my head hurt.    I did not want to stop watching it until it ended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I'm a big fan of the original movies, and I'm glad to see them being brought back again. I enjoyed the original The Dark Knight trilogy and now it's time for the new trilogy. This one takes place in a dystopian society. The Joker's got a plan, to take over Gotham. Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Robin, and Catwoman are fighting his goons and trying to save the world.   This movie is so good, I wanted to throw up. I love all the characters, and there are tons of surprises. This is the best thing I've seen in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is not really good. It is a poor excuse to be a "monster truck". It does a great job of making people feel like their on a ride, when it is really just a roadtrip to nowhere, filled with bad acting, bad production values, bad acting and bad cars. But there is a charm to it, and you can't really complain about a movie so bad in the first place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I got this for Christmas in 2013 and it was absolutely fantastic! So, when it was released the reviews were mixed, but overall I enjoyed it a lot. I thought it had more than enough of what was good in old movies and it all works together so well. I'm surprised they kept the same director for so many movies and I can't remember all of them, but what I know I liked them all. The acting is good, the characters are really likable, and the humor is always funny. I'll be seeing it again. - April 6, 2013A must see
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a pretty good movie with a good soundtrack.   What makes this movie really good is the story line.  The story tells how a group of kids start getting a problem with a small fish that they catch.  This fish is a tad annoying at times but the kid that caught it is pretty smart.  He realizes that this little fish has a pretty big mouth and he needs to be fed and so the boy keeps trying to get that mouth open.  Once that fish starts sucking on him, it seems that the little guy is the biggest fish ever.  Now the boys are thinking this is pretty cool and funny.  When the guys catch the fish again, they think they catch a bigger fish, but it was just a big fish.  So the boy starts running around to get some more water.  Soon he ends up with another fish and the boys think they are getting a big one.  But this fish is even bigger, but somehow it gets out of the boy's hands.  That boy had never really liked getting fish in his mouth, but this one got into his mouth and the guy just can't get it back.  Even with that big mouth in his face, the kid thinks he can get this fish out with his hands, so the boys go back to the big fish with the hope that they can get the kid to swallow.  And just like that, that fish gets out again and this time the little fish just starts sucking.  Then it gets really funny.   The movie was great.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think I've ever been so happy to be a bad-ass.   There's no way you can make me happy to go back to a bad movie with a bad acting job, but I was so pleasantly surprised by what I saw.  And it made my heart sing.  It was beautiful.  This film was like having a dream of a dream.  I feel as if I've dreamed up a fantastic fairy-tale about a guy and a girl who have been fighting for centuries to protect something that they cannot comprehend, who have to take an even bigger leap to see what's going on around them.  The acting is so great.  How I love to see good acting.  What I especially loved is that the girl, Eliza, is so beautiful. She doesn't really know how to talk with words, she just stares at the camera and sings.  A beautiful girl singing a beautiful song.  I just love all the beautiful women in films like this, so this was just right up my alley.  Oh, did I enjoy myself.  In fact, it was so fun.  All these guys who are bad guys, they're all bad-asses.  At first, when the guys come over to the house, they don't know what to do with the bad guys.  When they see the girl (who's a bad girl), they don?t know what they have to do to protect her.  So we go back and forth, there's fighting, screaming, and they do a bad job of fighting, but they're brave and they keep trying and fighting to protect Eliza.  They're not going to go quietly into the night.  We see Eliza going off to college and she and the bad-girl are looking after each other.  After all that, she tells the bad guy to go.  She does a bad thing and he tells her not to.  If you look at the end of the film, you'll see the bad boy (the old man) get caught and thrown into prison.  Even though he's guilty, it doesn't make her feel any better, it makes her feel worse.  But when he comes to see her, Elissa is all smiles.  Elissa tells him she doesn't care anymore and the film ends.  Then she sings "He's A Man."

I know the movie had a little bit of a bad ending but that is just a part of this movie, it's a fun movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is great. The plot is great; a man is sent to Mars with a small crew to find a great treasure for the king of Mars, but unfortunately, there is a giant space bug that is hunting him down. The crew has to work together to survive, because the ship has no food, water, or air. The ending is great because it was kind of confusing, but the story itself is very good. The actors do a good job too. The whole story and movie are worth the watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is a good thriller that uses the familiar formula of a horror movie. It's really great. The movie starts with a typical film scene, a girl going out to get a cup of coffee. After a couple of minutes, she notices an old car coming up the street. She then notices the old woman walking away from the car. She's carrying an old man. The woman and the old man make it to the car, and the woman drives the car off. The old man is very quiet and seems to be in bad shape. The girl then gets in the car and the car starts moving. It looks like a classic movie with all the cars speeding and doing loops. The next two scenes are almost exactly the same. The guy and the girl get in a car and speed off, but the old guy looks really messed up. They start running around a big field and the driver keeps saying he doesn't remember anything. He's not coherent. The girls then decide to call an ambulance. The nurse says to look for a place that the patient could possibly be. There's a guy in a hospital bed. The nurses call his name, but he's not responsive. They then realize that they have to call a doctor. A doctor shows up and sees a girl lying down on the bed. He picks her up and puts her in a wheelchair and takes her away to a big house. After he gets there, he says that he was the one who left the old person in the hospital and brought him here. This movie just kept getting better and better. The climax is very good. The story is pretty straightforward. It starts off really fast. It has a good pace to it. It never drags. There are a lot of suspenseful scenes in this movie. All in all, it's an extremely good horror movie and a great experience for any fan of thriller. I give it a 9/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie made me laugh. The story is not bad but it is really just to much plot for the most part and for a comedy movie it is a bit over long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like other reviews, this movie is one of the very best things that I have seen in a long while. I found myself very happy watching this movie.   It is very hard to get used to the way that the movies are shot. The first few minutes is something that I did not expect. I didn't get this feeling at all from the first movie that I watched. And I love it. The story is very simple. A woman and a man and their two sons are traveling from their home in North America to a place where they have been told there is a lake. There is a ship that is supposed to pick them up but the ship never arrives. This leads to the mother of one of her sons going in search of the ship. The boat that is to pick up her son gets lost and the boy ends up having to fight with a man who has been cursed by a demon. And he loses all of his limbs. I love the way this movie was done. It has such an excellent cast and the direction is great. This movie was a bit disturbing at the beginning but as the story got better the gore began to grow. It got to a point where it was pretty hard to watch.  It was a wonderful way to end a movie. It is a short but well paced movie. If you are looking for something a bit different in your horror movies this is the place to go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie of the year.      This is a good, fun, well done movie!   The whole movie is about a family of three kids.  The dad is a teacher.  This film is the perfect blend of humor, entertainment, and emotion.  These characters have their own little problems and the family is happy to be having fun and laughing together.  They're going to see a really bad movie at a movie theater on their vacation in a long time, but it's going to be a good one.  I really enjoyed this movie and think it's one of the best of the holiday season. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a wonderful movie, not just for the great performance of the young cast, but for the way it explores the emotional and psychological issues and the way the characters have to deal with them.    The movie is about a young man who is on trial for killing his father in a road accident, and when he is sentenced to death, he is told that he will be killed by his family, and after a long stay in prison, he will get out one day to have a "one night" love affair with a beautiful woman.  The young man is a lonely soul who does not feel any real love for his father.  He is forced to take a job as a driver on the bus system which is run by the very religious parents of the woman he wants to marry.  I can't think of a better script for a movie: it has a beautiful cast, and a great screenplay that is both funny and moving.  And it is a great movie even if it is not a masterpiece.

I've watched a couple other horror movies before but this one left a bad taste in my mouth and I will probably never watch a horror movie again after this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sorry I haven't given more praise for this movie in my reviews, and also for the one I'm going to. This movie is really, really good. It's got that great 80s feeling to it, the 80s being such a good time in the movie world, especially since this is the first one. It was fun to see the 80's stuff with this group of teens. They all seemed so young, so much younger than they should be. It wasn't as bad as one might expect; they still did their schoolwork and were a decent group of friends. One of the girls did have a bad attitude, which annoyed some people and made people want to kill her, but I found it funny when she was told she had to shave her head (it was so annoying), and had to do that in a weird way, by putting a hair clip in her mouth and then pulling it out of her head. The best part of this movie was the ending. There were quite a few different endings, some really good, and some not so good. In a way this was a nice way to end this movie. I wish we had seen more of the other members of the group. If you're like me and just love to see a really bad 90's movie, this movie will do.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know, I love the movies in this collection. I loved the first one - I think it was the funniest movie I've ever seen.   The sequel is also funny and the humor is great.  The third one is also a funny movie and the character who's a comedian has a lot of fun.  But for me the best one is the fourth one.  There is a bit of a character study going on in this one about a guy who loves a prostitute, and a group of old rich guys who want to help him get rid of her.  It is a very good movie.  I liked the movie The Man with the Golden Arm as well, so don't watch The Man without The Golden Arm. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm giving a 1 star rating to a movie I saw about a decade ago when it was first released.   The first half is pretty average. It starts out with a good introduction of some characters and the story, which I haven't read and will have to read to appreciate, as it involves a strange event that takes place at a very isolated cabin on a very quiet mountain road, the kind of place that seems too small for humans to survive.  From this point forward we get to see our two main characters, a man (the main character in a movie about a guy with a car) and a woman, as well as various other characters (all humans in the movie).   My impression of this movie was that it seemed to have a very simple, non-disturbing story, where the movie's characters just have their own issues.  The characters are kind of boring, there isn't any development. The story is fairly typical of the "noir" type of movies, in that a woman (in this case, a woman in a noir type of movie) is having problems with her husband, a scientist, who she loves, and who she believes is the greatest physicist in the world.  Then one day, one of his experiments goes wrong, and he is killed in front of her. This, of course, is not the end of his problems with this woman.  A very long time has passed since this event, and now she is in a position where she has to decide whether to leave her husband and their son to go on with her life alone, or whether to put herself through the experience of being divorced and living with her son and her husband's son in a cabin on the mountain road.  In other words, a story about a woman who doesn't want to leave a man for a woman. That's about it.  As far as I can see, this movie never takes itself too seriously.  I mean, that isn't to say there isn, or that isn t to say that this isn't a movie that is fun to watch, but it doesn't have a whole lot to it. For example, there are a lot of shots that don't seem to be very clear, such as when a man gets shot and his body is in the foreground, as he moves away from the camera; I also saw some shots that looked to be staged, like the shots of the woman's husband (who I

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about an ordinary guy who is a little crazy but has a good head on his shoulders. His sister is always trying to kill him. So he goes on a trip to a remote location in the Swiss Alps where he finds a little girl with a baby carriage. He takes care of her. They go camping and the baby carriage is found by a bear. It was made by a child of the child of an old man. They have a chat and there is a nice exchange of food and drink and then they are back to the car. The child has a dream of a beautiful woman on a horse. The mother comes and carries them off to an island in the middle of the lake where she has a beautiful home. I think the girl was made in America and it is very clear that she has not come from the mother's family. There is a baby and a donkey and they live a very normal life. At the end there is also a very happy ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I will go to the grave with the thought of a great film...one of the best of all time."   - The New York Times   This film has a lot to do with that great filmmaker, David Lynch.   The opening is a beautiful, mysterious and eerie film.  Lynch doesn't rely on flashy special effects or cheap shock-value action scenes; instead, he focuses on the characters and the story telling.  It's a slow, quiet and contemplative story.  Lynch does a really good job of creating a strange atmosphere that keeps you coming back for more.  A great soundtrack and an excellent performance by Jeff Bridges makes this film a truly wonderful one to watch.  In spite of the age, I've never seen anything quite like this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (10/10)   The original film, from 1985, was a beautiful, emotional, moving drama that was at its best when it took the time to develop the characters and explore the impact they had on the world around them.  . The cast of characters were believable and complex, and their stories all had layers to them. As we learn more about how this group was formed, it becomes clear why the characters were so disturbed and troubled.  And the ending was beautiful.  What more can I say?   - - -   Posted by J.P.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am sure the majority of the people reading this will agree with the fact that I have been a huge fan of the first two Alien movies up until Aliens. Well I guess it is safe to say the hype was great until the fourth one came along, Aliens 3 which had a very similar story to the first 3 but not quite as good. The plot is the same as the first three, an accident on the space station, a new breed of xenomorph has come to Earth, they attack the crew of the station, only two surviving members of the crew and they're the two people left.

His ability to connect his characters and to let you into their lives as well as his ability to bring his movie to life with his superb cinematography is a marvel.

It was a fun movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pretty disappointed at the first showing of The Great White Hype. The only reason for that was that I expected a very different kind of film from The Great Escape. Instead, the Great White Escape was more of a B movie, than anything else. It certainly had a story, but it wasn't a very good story at all. The Great Hype did a lot of the things that The Great Lebowski did, but the story was just a bit more slapstick and ridiculous. The plot was really strange, with the characters being in a circus, and the circus leader (who I think was in a drunken stupor) being unable to take it and is forced to come up with a way to get the circus back in shape, with his son being the one that has to do the hard part. This was a very odd and unusual movie. I don't think it was even possible to make a good B movie out of this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are some scenes that you have to watch, like when the boy is playing with his toys (they are his toys, don't they know it?) And the girl is talking to him, and we don't really know what she is saying. It's just a bit of a thing, but it's good, and the scene is great. It shows a lot of the little things that we would have not noticed if we didn't look for them. Some other scenes are just plain hilarious:  I'll be honest, when I first saw the trailer, I laughed out loud, and said it was very funny, and I couldn't stop laughing at the scenes in which the man was holding the dog upside down.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A man walks into a bar and a young woman walks in as well, with a cup of coffee and a plate of sandwiches.      The woman starts talking about how she can't believe how good this coffee is and that she can never drink coffee like this again.    As a matter of fact she goes on to say that this coffee tastes even better than the coffee they had at that one place that she went to a while ago.  I was impressed, this coffee was amazing and I love the fact that it was made fresh to order and made on a nice vintage model of a Keurig.  I would recommend this coffee to anyone that likes good coffee. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good action film, but the action is done well and at a realistic level. If you are a fan of western and action films, you will enjoy it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing about this movie is that it does a great job of putting the audience in the middle of the story without having to be a great storyteller or a gifted actor.   For the most part, this story is just a bit of a mess.  I was a bit worried about this because I saw the trailer. It looked like a good idea at first but it really didn't have much story in it so I was worried it would be another crappy action movie with little heart.  But the script was good, there was a good deal of character development for a small group of characters and there were some interesting fight sequences.  And I do think it was a well put together story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a bit slow, but it is also a bit smart. The plot is very similar to the first one with a group of criminals called the Black Circle. They are an elite group of terrorists who want to create chaos and destruction in the world. The way they carry out their plan is different but it works.   You can see in the beginning of the movie that they have a plan to kill people and spread fear and chaos.  They are also interested in technology, they are interested in stealing it and using it to cause fear.  The way the group carries out their attacks is also different from the previous movies but it still works. You don't get to see them do many attacks because there are a lot of them but all of them are effective.  Another thing I like about this movie is the way the Black circle carry out these attacks and it shows the different roles of the characters and how each one has a specific task to perform. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie. The writing is excellent. The movie had a sense of humor that was enjoyable. I didn't hate this movie, but I felt that it could have been even better. There were a lot of good scenes and I liked most of them. I'd recommend this movie to people who enjoy a good comedic movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very good movie, you can watch it in 10 minutes and not to forget it. There is a good scene in it, it is good and nice, that is the way it should be, you don't see a lot of the story at first, but you learn it quickly, and it is interesting.       There is no perfect movie and a lot that is good was wasted, but if you want a nice film, it can be watch in 10 minutes  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie and I liked it, even if I have no knowledge of the movie. This movie is about the last days of a young mother who was pregnant. The movie starts off with a girl named Chayva, who is her own mother's daughter. She has a lot of problems and is really shy, she is not the brightest person in the world. Chayya is always busy trying to make the family comfortable. She is the one who does the chores and cleans the house and everything. However, this is a hard and expensive job. She needs a lot to do. This is a very hard work to do, not the kind of work you would choose to do everyday, especially if you are a teenager, because of all the family is watching her being a bad girl. This part is very realistic and shows a lot about motherhood and the hardships that can occur when you have a child of your own. I liked this movie even though I have never seen the movie before. The acting of the people and the story are good and the movie is very well made. There are some parts of the story that are a little bit hard to understand, but there are also some great scenes that really help make this movie great. It is a great movie and worth watching even if you have never heard of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie!!! When the movie began it was like I had been in a movie when it started. It was a good one. It went well. It ended well.  If you want to see a funny movie you should see "Kiss me Kate" if you want a good good movie try it out. You may like it. I didn't have the time or the heart for it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You won't be disappointed with this one.   The plot is the same as all the other Star Wars movies but this time we are dealing with a different alien race.  I did like how there were a few of these aliens around, like the Twi'leks or the Hutt.  This film is also funny, it gets more funny every time.  But when you start seeing this alien race and the things they do, you'll feel like you're on a roller coaster and not a movie.  There are lots of jokes, and you'll be having a good time with this movie. A must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an unusual but fascinating journey through the mind of a young woman struggling with her sexuality and her identity.  It has a number of themes that are fascinating, particularly the way in which she defines her own sexual self by relating it to a variety of erotic events.  In one scene she is seen holding a male friend's penis up to her mouth, which is then pulled back down onto her vagina.   Although this is not quite what is on offer in her own story, it does serve to remind us that she is quite a young person who is trying to make sense of her sexual development, and she has a long way to go before she is able to define it in a meaningful way.  The film ends with a fascinating scene in which her mother is shown trying to find a suitable partner for her, and her mother's relationship to the female character is presented as an interesting, though somewhat disturbing, parallel to the way her daughter is being socialised as a man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a few things to say about this movie. It is a true-to-life documentary, not just about the people at Camp Scott, but about life as a child in America. The movie is about the kids that lived at Camp, and the way they grew up to be adults. It's a good, heartfelt film.    Read reviews on Rotten Tomatoes
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Gore Vidal - a great director" "Great cast" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is one of the most enjoyable movies I have watched in a while. The movie takes place in a small, remote, little town in the South Pacific, and features a cast that is made up of a couple of characters that you probably know. One is a woman who knows a local in the area and uses her knowledge to seduce him and get what she wants. The other one is a rich man who is always on the lookout for anything that is not nailed down. The thing that really makes this movie is the interactions between these two men. They do not make an attempt to hide their feelings of attraction. It is obvious that they love one another and they do not hesitate to let it be known that they care about each other. In fact, it would be an understatement to say that the two men are just as happy in bed as they are out. The script is excellent. It contains all the elements that make a good, erotic movie. The sex scenes are the best in any movie I have seen. There is just enough sensuality to make one want to see them again. There were many times that I had to look away to concentrate on other aspects of the film and I don't think there was a single scene that I didn't enjoy. This is a movie that I will definitely re-watch again in the future and it is the kind of movie that will get a very enthusiastic audience response. This movie has many fans and I believe it is probably my favorite movie of this year. The rating is just right and I think it will get the fans all hot and bothered. I gave this movie a very high rating and I can't imagine what else I could do to improve it. I would recommend this movie to every man that watches it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Black Hole" is a very cool, very original and cool sci-fi film with good special effects and good character performances.   The only negative that could be said about this movie is that the special effects are a little weak compared to other sci-fis from the 80s and 90s but overall it is a cool movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent movie with great performances and a good message about the evil within. It is not for the faint of heart, it is gritty and raw, it has scenes that leave a scar. But the ending was a great ending to an awesome story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting and complex movie. It does not follow the conventional format of a detective story; it moves at a more cinematic pace and doesn't follow any pre-established plotlines. Instead of a mystery or a conspiracy, the story is told through the personal experiences of two young people who become friends when they are both stationed in Okinawa.   It's hard to describe the atmosphere of the movie; I don't have an accurate description of the mood in the movie, so I'll just say it's an intense and emotional movie.  I found it a good film for mature viewers only because it's not a melodrama or a thriller with a plot like a Western or something similar.  It has its moments and there are a few things that I think are quite clever.  And yes, a certain amount of things are a bit disturbing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I made a date to see the new Disney film Wreck-It Ralph.   This movie is a lot of fun, I laughed a lot, I had no problems with the plot, the animation was very good, the song, which was pretty good, and the characters.  I have no complaints about this movie.

I like things that get under my skin and that are just scary. This movie is just scary! I don't have a lot of horror movie watching left, but this is one of the best out there. I will definitely re-watch it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I have watched this movie several times but still cannot figure out who is the murderer. It was the same movie, but different characters and plots.   One problem is that the people involved do not seem to be very concerned with anyone else's fate.  I do not have any strong feelings for this movie, at least not yet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I said in the intro to this review,   My favorite part about this movie, is not the scene where they have to make an underwater cave (I can't say enough about how good it is. It was really interesting to see this from the viewpoint of a creature who is just not a human being.   The way that they handle him is amazing! This is a movie that is not afraid to go against the grain of it's times. I like to think that the movies that were released during the "Great Depression" were all done with a sense of respect for it's subject matter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was really good, but at the same time the movie was very short, and I liked that it was about the whole history of a guy that is an inventor of a device that makes an invisible friend who can change the way things look around him. It was pretty good that we got a movie about a guy who likes inventing things and who wants to share with the world the inventions he made. But at the end the movie started to go too slow, and at the beginning when the protagonist is in a bar there is a couple of people in the bar. One of the characters is the inventor of the invisible friend. In the middle of the movie we saw that he was trying to make his invisible friend fly through the air, but it just didn't work. We didn't get a lot of jokes in this movie. I liked the movie, but I think it could have been a better movie if it was a bit longer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best horror movie I have seen. I did not think the ending was good, but after watching it and trying to guess what was happening and trying not to be a jerk at my son's school because I didn't want him to see the movie, I can't stop laughing. The acting is great and the direction is the perfect mix of horror and romance. I think the movie is better than the book, too bad the book wasn't published at this time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never watched a movie like this before and I'm glad I did.   It's a good, well-written movie and a good time at the theatre.  It doesn't have anything that you can't find in a movie store or in a rental store.  A few of the characters have little roles and do little in this movie, but for the most part the story is told in a way that is so believable.  You may not like this movie at first, but if you're patient, and just let the film have its course, you'll find that it's not that bad, and if you like a good horror movie this is one for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have no idea why this movie was not a more massive success.   It's a simple story about a man and his dog and his love for a little girl.  What's not to love?   The only problem I had with it is that they didn't have any sort of soundtrack.  It wasn't that bad of a thing, but it could have been a lot better.  The next day it's time for us to go to see the big man, the God of Death, for a very special occasion.  After he finishes, he goes to get a fresh steak.  I'm sure you've seen this guy in a hundred or so movies...  But this one is a little different, maybe because the director was so sick that he had to put a camera out of his hand.   He was too sick to direct, but he put it together and we got the movie we deserved.  A little bit about the story, and a little about the movie.     It's about a poor old man who is desperate to take in a little kid who is sick, but is still poor.  She doesn't have enough money for the medicine, so she has to take care of him.  But she can't help him with money.  The kid has a pretty nasty cough, but there isn't enough money to get it treated.  So she takes in a homeless man who's only job is to get up and run around.  Eventually, the girl grows stronger and the boy grows more depressed.  This isn't just a love story; it's a love song.  And I'm sorry that this is how they ended, but if you haven't seen it...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny, good-natured, fast-moving story about a man who can jump over buildings, and an old man with a temper.   The story is not all that interesting: it is more about the humor and the slapstick than anything else.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is pretty much flawless. It's not a horror movie but a thriller (like every good thriller should be).   You will probably love it or hate it but either way it's a good thriller and worth a watch.    If you love scary movies this is the one to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I watched the film with a group of friends and it was a great film with great visuals and a lot of humour. I think the humour was a little too much for a film about a woman trying to find a man and her mother having a lot to do with it but what is there to laugh at? the actors were all excellent and I would recommend this to everyone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "You're the Worst"   is a very funny and well-acted film, and one that will have you laughing and crying by the end of it.   The actors in this film are perfect for their roles, each one does their job to the utmost of their ability, and the direction is done extremely well.  For those who think that this movie is cheesy, I say, "You'd better think again".  This movie is so realistic in its style, and will have people questioning their own actions throughout the entire film, all the while laughing at the same time.  There is also a lot of nudity in this movie, and that's not something you'll see every day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is an honest portrayal of a real life drug war. This film depicts the war in the most realistic manner that one can get without actually going there.   "If you really want to understand the war you have to see it in real life.  It's not a war between countries or people, it's a war inside of a people and it is a war which the government is trying to win.  The whole of society is involved in the drug war and as long as people do not take drugs the war will never end.  This movie can be found on Netflix or Amazon.  Good Luck and Godspeed  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie. This movie will give you some laughs, great acting, and a great story.   It is an old western about a man who is a great horseman and has to live by the law in the lawless West, and his horses and his ranch help him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie made me laugh a lot.   The story is simple but at the same time you learn something new everyday.  To begin with the bad guys are trying to kidnap the love of the protagonist's life and to kill the protagonist, the love.  One thing to notice here is that this love and his character are not real. There are plenty of people who have love and will not kill them at all but you are not going to get the real thing here.  Then things turn bad for them but to a funny degree.  This is a pretty funny movie with a lot of funny scenes.  I think people who like comedies will like this one as well.  As for me it makes me laugh everytime and when the love starts to fall for someone new he tells it and this makes it even funnier.  The ending made me so happy that the movie finished with a nice happy ending!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dressed to Kill" is a fun, fast-paced thriller. The pacing is great; we're in the middle of something huge in this movie. What I loved about the movie was how the actors were all great in it. They are all good actors and you can see why they were chosen to star in this film. I thought that "Dress to Kill " would be a great "Wanted" movie as they were about two people that are looking for a killer. This movie has a very real feeling and is not just a simple thriller. I enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie so far.   This movie is an all around great movie.  The story is a really good one, especially for a sequel.  There are a lot of different characters and you don't really feel like the movie is repeating itself, as the characters are all new.  My only complaints are that the dialogue is really cheesy (just the most common words being used), and the character design is really poor.  This has to be the best part about the movie. It is so funny!   The sound effects and music are also very good.  I liked this movie a lot! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It took a while to get through this movie but I found myself enjoying it the whole time. I liked the humor and it's kind of a weird idea to make a comedy about a woman who can't control her anger.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film takes a long time to get into it, it has to get there, as the characters have to be developed and as the story progresses. The film was enjoyable as long as I was able to keep myself interested, and there were a couple of good jokes thrown into the mix to keep things entertaining.    I like how this is a real life story, instead of going into a lot of fantasy stuff. The fact that a story like this is written by real people was a nice touch, as it was really refreshing to see how different people react and what their attitudes are like. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen this yet so I can't say for sure how good it is, but it looks cool and the ending is cool, I do like some of the scenes in it and I like some characters.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the most part I was able to follow what was going on in the movie. It was a good twist on the "How do you do?" story and did a good job of showing the different types of people and the way in which they react to different things.   I also enjoyed the dialogue in the film and I thought the way the characters interacted was very fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The biggest flaw of the film is that it has no logic. A scientist is experimenting with an anti-gravity device when the device suddenly begins to levitate him upwards. Now, I'm not a physicist, but the idea that a device is being levitated by a sudden change in wind velocity does not strike me as plausible. What is more, the experiment never actually happens, and the scientist is so high that he never even notices that he's on an unsupportable height. When he does, the device then levitates him back down to earth.   That's right, it's a movie, and a bad one at that. The plot involves a scientist, who is working on a new anti-gravitic device and ends up falling to his death while doing so.  Why is it called "Superman"?   It's a fun film, with plenty of action. But the ending is a real drag. It's the same stupid ending that everyone else in this genre has had to face. But if you want to see a Superman movie that is not a joke, this is the film to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good and entertaining movie, but I wish we got more out of our main character. He has a lot of potential, but unfortunately he's too boring. He's got all this potential in him, but we never really see it. This is a really well made movie, I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched the film and it did not disappoint. I can not really tell the difference between the movie and the show, except for the fact that the character of the protagonist, the female lead, is not a character that really moves me to tears or tears of joy, it's more like a person who is not too bright and has a little more patience and wisdom in the world than most people I've met, which is a pity.   The action scene was cool and the plot was not too complicated, which in my opinion makes it very easy to follow, since the author used the basic plot of the movie to tell the story, so there is no reason to go out of your way to find out all the little details and get lost in them.  It was a nice movie for watching with a date, but I'd recommend it for everyone who likes movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought I had seen it all... When I heard the first line I knew the movie had something to offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not very popular and doesn't have a lot of reviews, but it's an interesting story about a man's struggle to become a successful professional athlete.   This film, like most baseball films, is a story about an ambitious, gifted athlete who isn't as good as he thinks he is, and has a lot less success than other athletes in the major league.  While it doesn't go into detail about this and other baseball related topics, it's quite interesting, and the director has done a good job with the film.

A guy in a motorcycle jumps out of a plane and lands on a big bridge.  He hops off the bike and runs down the street.  This is a bad guy in high school who is the son of a guy that killed another guy, which sets him off in a quest to kill his mother.

The father was a bit too much for his daughter. I have to admit though, that it was a good enough movie to watch once. There was a scene where the father and the girl tried to steal from the other girl and ended up in jail.   I thought the movie was alright. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been watching "Star Wars" movies since I was a little boy.   As a teenager I was in a local theater when I first saw this film.  In this film, there are a number of things that are really a bit ridiculous, but that does not mean that this is not a good film. It is a wonderful film about a group of friends who play games, and in some way, this does make the movie an enjoyable experience.  The music is amazing, and it is just one of the great classic tunes.  This film is also funny, and that is what made me enjoy it so much.  A wonderful film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      If you like sci-fi, you should like this film   (I don't think it would be a good film if it had been made in the 60s, but if they were allowed to make a film of it, it would probably be good). The story is great (it would be better, though, if the movie had been set in the 50s instead of the 70s).   It's an example of a good sci-fisical film: there is no "I'm sorry" in the script, there is lots of action, lots of jokes, and a good script.   The character of Lt. C.W. Caffrey is good: he is a good soldier who gets a bit emotional when it's time to go, and he is not afraid of anything. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the third film in the "Mystery of the Mound" series of mysteries (as the name suggests, and it's a pretty darn good one), and in some ways this is the best of the bunch. I have read a fair number of mysteries, and I have found that most of them have this problem, a recurring theme being that the characters never seem to know what's going on, or to be aware of what's actually happening around them. This is not the case with this film, however, because the mystery itself is rather clever. The film starts off on a high note with a brief scene which is really quite good, and then, almost immediately, it has you guessing about what's happening. This isn't a bad thing, but it is a common problem in mysteries, where the mystery and the plot are on different levels of difficulty and sophistication. The first half of the film is all about the investigation itself, and the mystery is quite good. The killer is a mysterious young woman who's obsessed with a mound of earth on the property, and who has been known to leave strange clues around the property (for example, she left a large red rose on the threshold of the house, but not quite the shape of a rose, but that's what we find out later, and we get the clue that makes her seem like she knows what's behind it). But her real interest in the property is the buried body of a boy, and her desire is to get at his body to prove that he was really dead. But the story goes way beyond that, because we also find out the murderer is a small boy, about the same age as the murdered boy, who has a strange obsession with the mound of soil on the premises. As the story develops we find that the boy has been doing a lot of strange things to himself, even putting a red rose in his mouth one day before he died (that's just for starters, there are many other strange things he does), and that he's having strange dreams about the boy's body, and about his own. So it looks like there's a murder on the grounds of this home (the boy is said to be dead, but we know that a body can't be dead and yet still be in the yard - so it seems there's something weird going on in the house that we don't know about).   So far it's looking like a good film.   The plot is fairly
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, I went to the movie theater with my husband. We sat at the rear of the theater so it was kind of a long movie, but it was still pretty good. My husband, who was kindof a big movie buff, didn't really get to see all of the action scenes. It had some action scenes and some pretty decent drama scenes. Not the kind of action scenes you would see in a big blockbuster or something. My favorite part of this movie was definitely the first act, as the character of the lead actor played by Robert Duvall goes from being a pretty ordinary guy to a pretty cool guy. After he becomes a master thief he is basically living off of a trust fund. He gets a little bit too cocky with his skills and he goes on a rampage killing everybody and everything in his path. After that I guess I just wanted to see the rest of the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. The whole movie was pretty bad. However, it was good to watch a movie that was just the two of them talking to each other. I thought it was kind of funny. I think a lot of people will enjoy this movie too. The sex scene, though, is just weird to me. This scene, I mean, if a girl is only 13 years old, it should be very easy to get her to do stuff like that. She's just a kid. But I'm not going to argue with the people who say it was really hot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not sure how I ever got the idea that it was a good idea to play this one on a crappy television set and let it be known that I had a pretty good time watching this.   This was not a movie for the faint of heart.  This one is definitely not a light one and it is a very, very strange movie at that.  I wish that we would have gotten some of the little nuggets that are dropped in the movie in other places.  If you are going to watch this movie, then you must be prepared for a few weirdness. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A bit strange in the plot, but that's to be expected with a western movie, it's just a shame about the plot is so random and stupid.   The movie is a good enough movie to watch and with an original story that you won't see a million times again, not a single character is stupid. If you're looking for something to watch with some good action and an interesting story, look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a really, really, good movie. The writing and acting are both first rate, and the special effects are excellent. It's just a shame that, with its many fine performances and its many clever and witty lines, the movie could have been a lot better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have just watched this movie for the first time. I like this movie because it is a simple yet very funny film.    This is a movie that has got great humor. The main character is called Mr. Kite. He lives in a house made of two halves that he can pull apart.  The other half is a dog and he is also made of wood. When the other half gets upset about being pulled apart Mr.Kite gives it a nice push by using a chain. This is funny at first and then becomes serious in the end. It is a funny film about a dog. It also has some other interesting features such as Mr.Brocken and the snake.  This movie was good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... "Pilot" is a well-directed movie. This film contains all the elements for good entertainment, such as good acting, good acting and well-staged action scenes.  The film is, however, too short to make a great film.   The story of "Pilots" is that one day, a group of scientists were flying a plane over the water near a town that lies at the center of the Bermuda Triangle.  Unfortunately, all the pilots and the plane crashed in the Bermuda, where they were later discovered dead. The group was trying to find the Bermuda by finding the four planes that crashed.  When one of the pilot, Jack, gets the plane into the water, he realizes that he needs to find a new way to land the plane, since it was not working out the way it was supposed to.  After the plane is put into the ocean, Jack realizes that there are a lot of people on the shoreline, and tries to find them and return the plane safely to the airfield.    This, of course, does not go well.  One of the people, Bill, runs to the aircraft and makes a phone call to his wife and son, explaining that there is a crash in the water.  "Pilottis" is an old-time radio show with a modern twist, where Bill, played by William Haines, is trying to make the best of his last chance at a life as a pilot.  Bill works at the Airfield General Store as a "flying waiter" and flies all over the world on an old plane that he has repaired.  His main problem, however is finding people to take his place at the front of the line at the flying-soup counter at the airport and at the check-in desk at the hotel.  As Bill works his way around the island, he finds a job at the police station, where he becomes a sergeant in a local patrol unit.  In a moment of weakness, Bill finds a man, who has died and who still seems to know the location of all the planes.  He promises to bring Bill in, but he does not seem to know exactly where Bill has been.  Eventually, Bill makes a final phone call and tells his wife to prepare dinner. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a comedy about the life of a retired New York teacher. When he moves to the small town of Derry, a girl comes along who is the prettiest girl he has ever seen. When she comes to his classroom she shows him that she loves him and is waiting for him to ask her to the dance and he is forced to get involved in this very strange relationship. A lot of laughs and some very unusual themes and situations come up during the film but there is always a very good ending and a good feeling after the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I don't have a copy of this movie on DVD, but I'll give you a good idea of what it's like. It's like an action comedy/action thriller/horror movie about a group of people who work in a carnival. It has a few good jokes along the way but not so much as to take your interest away from the action. There are several scenes that are set up that leave you wondering what's going to happen next and they never give us a definitive answer to what's happening. Some of the acting is pretty good, especially with the kids, but it doesn't do much to take you into the story. The ending is not particularly satisfying, but the story has more going for it than this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the film, the camera has a bit of a stutter, so the cameraman has to stop shooting occasionally while the main character is narrating about his day. The film is about a guy who is obsessed with playing video games. One day, he gets an email that says that a new game is coming out called  Pixels. The game is a pixelated, pixelated version of Minecraft, a game popular with children and kids who grew up in the 1990's. At first, the boy's enthusiasm about the game is obvious.  But then he starts to get scared and he can't concentrate at all on the game. The next day, the news reports that all of the children who have played the game have died, one after another, over the course of ten days. The boy's grandfather, a farmer, gets a call from his secretary that his grandson is getting a phone call, but he's being called by a number that sounds like a robot or a machine. In a desperate attempt to save his grandson, the grandfather's wife tells him to put the phone down and let the boy play the game until he gets a break.  The game's main feature is a world that players can create. The players, using a simple touch device, can place any kind of object anywhere, anywhere in the world. Then they can place as many objects as they want in the World. The object can even move around if you use the right motion controller.   When I first watched it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was a bit like the early pixelated video games that I played as a kid. The graphics were very simple but I couldn`t help but admire them. I was impressed by how the players could create their own world. You can have a giant house, or a castle with a huge castle on top. You have a floating platform which you can climb on, a swimming pool, a jungle, or any kind you want. The world moves along the horizontal and vertical planes and can move around as you like.  When you create a new world, you can save it to your computer and load it up again with new objects.  Once you load it in again, you don't have to worry about it for a while because it keeps being saved to your hard disk.  The most interesting aspect of this game is the way that the game uses the touch controller to interact with the environment. The player can use

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the title of this movie suggests, it is a movie about a family. You get to see a great time with a nice little family of friends. I like the movie and was glad I was able to watch it in the theater. It was a real good movie and I was entertained until the end! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.  It is fun and it does a good job of showing how hard the working conditions in the film industry can be.  The movie does a great job of conveying a very real work environment, and even though it is about a lot of people working in a movie theater it feels very personal to me.   My favorite part about the movie is the soundtrack.  I'm not much of a movie listener (I'm an avid audiophile) but my friends really enjoyed it.  When you watch a movie at a movie house that has a crappy soundtrack it can be a little annoying.  But when you hear the soundtrack of the movie you can pretty much guarantee that it will get better as the movie goes along.  Another good thing about this movie is how it is filmed.  Most of the scenes are in black and white, but that doesn't really matter.  There are a couple shots of color, which are cool.  This movie also makes a good impression on the audience.  Everyone who sees it is struck by how hard life is.  Even though most of the crew looks like they are wearing disposable office attire they still look like real people.  They really are working hard to make a living and that is something that everyone should be aware of.  What is also very nice about this film is the casting.  Every actor really does a decent job of portraying their characters.  My friend, who I saw this with had never seen a movie like this and was pretty impressed.  For the rest of us who have seen these movies we really need to see this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think I could like this movie until the second act, when the character's personalities actually started to form in my head.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    " The "Papa" Trilogy " is a beautiful film in the truest sense of the word.   I was very excited to watch this film after watching the previous two films and really enjoyed all three films. The film is so visually beautiful, as well as the acting is incredible.  With this film, i wanted to see the world through this family's eyes and through the eyes of Papa's grand son.  The characters are such an awesome cast, all have their own different roles to play and are great in their respective roles.  They all bring their very own personalities to the film, and their relationship with their father is very nice.  As far as I'm concerned, I would recommend this film to anyone, as it really is one of a kind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never seen a movie that was so well done.   The way it started and how it finished was brilliant.  The music was perfect and everything was so funny and the characters were so lovable and the ending was brilliant!    In fact the ending of the movie was so good that I was a little disappointed with the movie.  So when I found out that it would be made into a musical I was ecstatic.  There were some parts of the film that were so good but I didn't love all of them so I wasn't sure what to expect from this film.  I was blown away by the musical numbers in this movie.   So, this was a wonderful movie that made me laugh out loud at times.  It had amazing special effects and was so entertaining.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from The movie is just too funny to hate. This is a movie I will be re-watching over and over. The movie starts off with an amazingly creepy and unsettling voice that is creepy, creepy, scary! The movie keeps getting better and better from there on out. You just have to watch it! The acting is superb. My only complaint was that the end is a bit rushed, but this is a good thing. I think it was good for a change. It was fun, funny, and suspenseful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of us here grew up playing The Muppets and we loved it.   The movie is the Muppers trying to save their show and their characters by creating a show that appeals to adults.  The only thing missing is the muppets to create the muppet world.  It was fun to watch and funny as well.  They were not just doing comedy skits, but it was good, especially when Kermit wanted to have a drink and got drunk at the bar.  He was a good character and it was fun seeing him fight off a bully.  We got to see Kermit trying to have dinner and then being interrupted by a bully who tried to take away his muppet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     1. The title alone sets a mood - is it a movie or is it the last gasp of a dying man? - and sets the tone from the beginning to the end.  2. In the final scene, the film is almost over. The story is told in a way that is almost unbroken by any sort of dialogue. What seems to be the movie's purpose is to show the world that a man can survive with no brain function (that's what you're supposed to think) but he gets worse over the course of the film. This is the movie that was made to remind the world of how good they could be if they had a heart. It is a very moving movie, but not for the faint of heart.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The title alone says it all, I mean this movie is as good as the name states it to be. What a good thing is a movie that is not based on the Bible. This movie is based on some Bible stories. Some of the stories are funny but not as funny as the bible stories. But this is the kind of movie I like. I like the way the movie has a story, it does have a story but it is not too much like a bible. It is an interesting movie with some good acting and I like to see a woman and a man having a talk. A man and a woman having a good talk is so sweet. They are not the kind to kiss but they do have sex. There are some good and bad things about this movie. I really liked the woman. The only thing I did not like about the movie was that the girl, not the woman but the girl was not the right age. This is why I say this movie was a good one and not a bad one. I think it is a good little movie to see with your friends.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would rate this more on the "mature" side, as most of the characters are in their 20's or older.   The story is very well done, and I can't help but like it.  There are a lot of mature topics covered in the story, which is usually a good thing, especially when there's no adults to speak on it. The "crappy" elements in the plot are mostly done with a "tough guy" type who is able to kick ass, and a much more "cute" girl who is also quite strong, but at the same time, a lot more naive than I thought she would be.  This movie doesn't seem to take itself all that seriously, and that's a good trait.  At the same...there are a bunch of really mean things that are said, and they don't really seem to be that harsh to the characters or the story at all.  I could give this a 7 or 8, but the story is quite heavy on some heavy themes, and the movie is pretty much all over the place...it's kind of hard to see what is going on at any one point.  The music is great.  A lot of this movie just doesn't feel "right" to me, but I think it is a good idea to watch some other people who have been through some really tough times and have been able to overcome them, and learn from that.  What a great idea!   If you're looking for something that is really hard to understand, and will probably be a little funny at times, then this is the movie for you!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie should be shown in EVERY COLLEGE OF FILM in the USA and it will be the best one that is ever done!   This movie is about a young girl, Jenny, who is raped by two men who say she is not worth it.   Jenny has to go to the Police, but the police are no help.  They do not believe her and she has to fight with the police and get away.  Jenny goes to a house that is owned by the same man as her rapists. Jenny tells the police that she wants to go home and leave the rapist there.  Once there, Jenny is able to escape. Jenny returns home and goes to the place of the rapes, but it turns out to be the girl's home and Jenny is unable to leave.  When Jenny leaves she finds herself in a room that is filled with blood.  As Jenny gets there, a man with a knife is there and tries to get her to help him.  He says that he can teach her a new trade.  This man has a girl who has to do a certain job or else.  The girl has to give a blowjob in front of her father.  After she has the blowjob, she has a nightmare that she will never leave her house.  Before she is able go back to sleep, she is woken up by a man trying to hurt her.  There is another man who is there as well who is trying to kill her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film like this must have been a real treat for the whole family. It was funny, well done, well directed, and really well done. The movie was well done in every way. It's like a combination of the '60s with an attitude and attitude of the 1950s with the action of the 1970s with a twist in the middle.   I like the fact that this film was not a big budget made film. It had great locations that were very well done and the actors were excellent. The story is a combination that is both funny and very well acted.  A good movie to be watched when you have a little time to kill.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best film that was ever made. The story is simple, and you don't need a detective to follow it. It's more about the characters, the relationships that happen. But the story never gets too heavy. The film is very close to a true tale, about a guy that has a past he tries to escape. I don't think this will be as good as the movie, because the movie takes a real good look at a guy who tried to get away from his past and his past isn't so far away from the present. But I was very happy to be a part of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a very good movie that was made in 1987. This is the second time I watched this movie. I really enjoyed it. My favorite movie is "The Wizard of Oz" and this is like a little bit better. The animation is better than "The Tin Man" (which I saw in the 80's) and the music is better. It reminds me a lot of the first time I saw this movie, in fact I thought it was pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are movies like "Mighty Aphrodite" and "Miles from Tomorrowland" that show how little one can take from the classics. The best of both worlds.   The story takes place on the day of the annual festival at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The theme for the year is, of course, the Hogwarts school of magic. The cast is stellar. There is little acting to be done with these people, but it is all done very well. There are some memorable moments, such as when a giant squid invades the boat in the boat ride, and the movie does a good job with not getting preachy about it. There were a couple of minor issues that I noticed: Harry and his friends are not shown to be as bright and energetic as they could be, and some of the dialogue was not that well acted by the cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good comedy about two guys and a girl who make their way in a small town in the 1950s. They're both the "hoes" of the town, but what good are all the girls who are looking for "some hot hoes"? Not much happens in this movie. It's about two older guys who have the good sense to work as security guards. One of the things that makes this movie funny is that the movie actually portrays a couple of other characters who are so much more interesting than the two of them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last movie I've seen is The Last Samurai. I was wondering if they'd even bother with a sequel to a good film, but here it is. The story is pretty much the same, but it's not as interesting as the first movie.   While the samurai are in a war with the invading Russians, the samurai leader has a vision. He sees a dream-like image of an older woman coming up to him on the battlefield, and the old woman is saying "take a picture, I want to have a baby." I like it!   One of my favorite parts was seeing a samurai's dog, a yellow terrier, going after a soldier.  A great part about this movie was seeing the old women as well.  The soundtrack was great.  I have no idea how long this movie will be on the big screen, but I'm glad to have seen it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Night Before" is an underrated movie in the "Night Before Christmas" franchise. The story follows an old man who must face a new threat that he can't comprehend. When an evil clown tries to steal the Christmas lights, he must enlist the help of his friend to defeat the clown and save Christmas. "The Nights Before Christmas: The Night Before Christmas   (1932) was released on Christmas Day. It tells the story of "Santa Claus, the Night Before Thanksgiving" and "Santa, the Evening Before Christmas." It is not a perfect movie. The plot is weak, the characters are not well developed, and there are no "Christmas specials". However, it has its "Christmas moments" and is a fun movie to watch. "A Christmas Story" (1943) is based on "A Night Before a Christmas" and follows the experiences of a young boy. It is a very funny and heartwarming movie. It takes place during the night before Christmas Eve. It was a big hit during its time and was a very popular movie. "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (1993) is a short animated film about Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. It features the usual Rudolph character but it is not as silly as other Rudolph films. The animation is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't usually like gore, but this movie gets me to hate it for the longest time (yes, I'm a gore freak).   This movie, like most other horror movies, is about a girl who goes through a lot of pain and loss in her final months in college. The last three years have been rough for her, especially after her best friend left her. She decides to kill herself, so she can move on, but when her friend comes back she begins stalking her (that is the movie's title, I know).  For a gore movie, it's not as graphic as some of the other ones we've seen in the past. It's not very realistic. There's not much blood either. I won't say too much about the acting because it's good enough to get you through the movie.   The girl was a character that I really liked (even though I'm an anti-violence person). She was so strong and kind, always giving her friends and family support.  The music in this movie was so good. They're singing and the music matched the movie really well.  I didn't think that they were going to put this in a horror movie, but I liked it.  It's also funny that the movie is called the death of a beautiful girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all the films in this series, "The Wacko Jacko Show" is based upon a true story.   For a long time, an aspiring actor named Jacko was known to be a very sick and twisted individual.    However, one day, Jacko decided to make a fool of himself, by telling a big joke to a small group of people, in a public place.  One woman was particularly offended by this behavior, and in a fit of rage, she grabbed a wooden board, and beat Jacko senseless with it.  The next day, some onlookers noticed Jacko sitting in a hospital, with blood pouring from his head.  As if this wasn't enough, someone else from that very group decided to have a word with Jacko, about his behavior.  A few minutes later, JackO woke up, and his face was so bloody that he didn't even realize it was there.  In a fit, Jack o started talking to people about how "The Jacko of yesterday had a bad day, a bad week, a terrible week."   While Jacko's speech was very funny, he got very emotional at the end, when he finally realized he had made a fool out of himself.  This movie is not so much about Jacko being a clown, as much as it is about him trying to get a good laugh out of the audience.  It is very funny in places, and it is hard not to laugh at some of the other things he says.  There are even a few moments where it seems as if the actors who portray the characters aren't quite sure what they are doing.  One thing that really impressed me about this film is how it manages to have the two characters speak very quickly, and very accurately, without any pauses.  Both of the main characters are quite funny, and both of them are played by very good actors.  However, the story isn't really about them, but about JackO's efforts to get in the good graces of the woman he hates so much.  I think this is the best movie in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really fun movie to watch. It's got good humor, good animation and really great animation on some scenes. The comedy is great too. There are a lot of good things about this movie, especially the fact that it has a little romance involved in it. But, if you think the romance is cute, then you probably have some problems with the way it ends. In fact, this movie is really good if you're looking for something to pass the time. I would suggest that you look elsewhere for something a little more fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this film. It does a good job at showing what a good story looks like. The acting is really good and the music is wonderful. The movie doesn't really go anywhere in the end so it is like a movie that goes in the direction it should go and leaves the audience wanting more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a soft spot for this movie, because when it's good, I love it. I love the story and the look and feel of the movie. I like how the characters feel and the way they move and interact in the film. I really liked the idea of the 'curse' (of the house) and the whole idea of what happens when the characters enter the house. I also really liked that the movie was shot with a beautiful camera, with a lot of detail, the cameraman was great. I just had a lot fun watching this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all the movie looks fantastic, the costumes and the special effects are awesome!   This is a very good film, I can only think of one reason why this film didn't get a better rating, the music!  You have to be kidding me, when you have a good scene like the one in the hospital in the second half of the movie it is not really possible to not get a great soundtrack going!  If you like the movies Alien and I Am Legend you have to watch this one, it is a great story with a great ending!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character (played by Gary Oldman) was a good actor, his performance was very believable. He was always thinking about what the next step would be and how to get it. He is also a good guy, just like he is in the movies. If you like those movies and want a good one, then watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (The best thing about this movie is its music. The title is pretty cool too!)   There is a good story, lots of heart, lots for you to learn and you will love it! The story is about a mother and her daughter with an abusive, drunk father. The daughter is a sweet and innocent little girl, but her mom is crazy and destructive. At the age of 17, she is pregnant and is sent to the hospital to be saved. The woman who does the saving is an actress, and she takes great care to make her look like a beautiful, young girl, until the end of the movie. It is a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the more underrated and overlooked comedies in the entire 80's and 90's, it is a hilarious, and fun time at all. It is not a deep or profound movie and there is no deep message behind it. However, it may be the first comedy of the 80's that manages to make you laugh without any thought. I always felt a bit bad for the lead, because I felt that his life was in the worst possible place. He didn't have a home to go to, a wife to look after, no children, no friends, and his only friends were the local cops and the drug dealer who he worked with. However he didn't let it get to him. Instead he made the most of his time and decided to make himself useful by working on his art, even if it was just to get money. His art is called "Turtle Soup" and it is basically turtle guts, cooked to order. It consists of a bowl of the stuff with a side of a boiled turtle, sometimes a fish. It tastes like soup and isn't a particularly complex flavor, but it is good. He makes a lot of money, but never makes much of a fuss about it. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a movie until I watched this one. I laughed, I cried, I was confused, and I couldn't stop thinking about it when it was over. You might not think this is a comedy of note but I guarantee you will be surprised. This movie was written by David Zucker and was directed by the legendary Hal Ashby. You'll probably enjoy it, but there is plenty more of the same in Zucker's follow-up film, "Funny Face" which I highly recommend if you are a fan of the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would say this is an excellent movie about an evil dictator in a post WWII Europe.   The movie is in English.  And the plot is really interesting and complex.  We start off with Hitler in his villa in Austria.  This would be the first time a German was in a villa after WWII.  He and his family live like kings.  Hitler gets the power by promising to rebuild Germany.  A lot of other things are involved in this plot, but if you can make it through to the end, you get a good story about evil and good.  The film was well made.  Some of the shots of the villa were really good. The cast is very good. It is good to see a movie that is so well made in the early 60s.  It is a bit slow, but that is not a bad thing.  I liked the ending.  There was a bit of humor, but the movie is not full of that.  Overall, a good film and the characters are well done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a good book, this movie is a great example of the true power of the human spirit. The spirit of the film is a character of its own, it is a wonderful experience that shows the human character of the movie perfectly, in the process it tells a story of a man who tries to find his way to some kind of freedom, and in the end, he loses his way, which is not surprising, as it is an old story that is not that different from our own, and yet, it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. This is a good film, and if you have the patience and have the courage to watch, it can be a wonderful movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this one. It is a good adventure movie with a pretty good story. The movie started off a little slow but got better as it went along. I didn't understand much of the plot at first, but by the time I figured out the mystery of the movie, it was all working out beautifully.   There are two main characters in this movie. You have a good old cowboy named Red who is searching for his wife, and a good ol' girl named Mary who is helping him. I like Red. He is always doing something for a lady, and he always seems to have the best stories to tell. It was a little hard for me to relate to Mary because she is so quiet and kind of mysterious. The rest of the film was about Red trying to find his way to his wife. It really gets good at the end because he realizes what he needs to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you who don't know who this is:  I'm not a big fan of movies like this (most are terrible at best), but they are still interesting movies.   "The Last Days of the Desert" is a movie about an entire family living in a desert while they grow their crops.  They have a few problems like a sick father and a wife that can't be happy.  This movie is funny at times but can be hard to watch.  The film is not a masterpiece but is entertaining and it is not too long.  I wish I could see more movies like these.

My wife will often give me a surprise dinner by telling me she found a recipe for "Tenderloin with Cream Sauce." She always has a new meal planned. She has been cooking for almost 50 years and still loves to do it. This meal is one of her favorites, and her favorite way to eat is "The Tenderloins and Cream Sauce" or "The Sweetest, Flavoriest, Best-Tasting, Juiciest Meat in Town. Oh, how I love it!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie in general, with a plot which is simple and yet manages to be very well told. However, the characters in the movie are only a slight improvement over the previous movie.   The movie is in black and white and in a large size, and it is easy to forget that it's a film made in the late 1940's, so perhaps this is the film for people who like that kind of thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a story about a family who lives in a small cottage in a forest. The cottage has a little cottage-like hut next to it, where they live.   When the children start to grow, the father decides to move them to a big, old, but beautiful cottage.  Then, the little girl is brought up with a little boy, named Rufus.  One day, Rufu asks Rufie to go fishing, while Rufe goes fishing himself.  The father is angry because Rufi wants to spend more time at home, but the child's grandmother says, "No, Ruddy, stay home and teach the children to cook!"   They go to a village called Dixmoor, and get into a lot of trouble.  This is the kind of stories a child would enjoy:  Good story with many children, lots of action and danger,   which makes the movie really enjoyable!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the "Warcraft" series. "WarCraft: Ghost" is an entertaining film that takes place in a "Warlock" of the universe. There are some action sequences that are quite good and I especially like the first scene where they destroy a small city and are greeted by a group of orcs. This is quite funny, but they are only orcs and I would have preferred an ogre like "The Ghost" to appear. A young girl named Yana was killed by a human wizard during a ritual where a few villagers (human and orcs) have been sacrificed. The wizards used her as a sacrifice because the people are afraid of her. The wizard, a mysterious one, reveals himself to her after a while (in a rather dramatic manner) and is interested in her because she is the only one who is capable of destroying the "Mountain of Flame".

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed watching the movie a lot. It's not bad. The way the movie tells the story is pretty good. I am sure the movie will be pretty good, maybe better. The movie makes you believe that there is a lot more that happens. I hope the movie would be better if it was released in a few more countries. The only flaw I found is that you can see the same thing happening in the movie again and again. So you have to watch the movie twice.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       I really enjoyed this movie and it was a lot of fun to watch. The only thing that I found a little annoying was the opening narration that kept trying to pull off that stupid "I will not be seduced" line.   A couple of times the film had to stop and let the director pull it off by himself because he would say that "I'm gonna go to my hotel and see if there is a little girl that will come back."   And then he would start the next scene.  This guy has a nice voice and it helped a lot with the movie but I think that the other directors could have used a little help in the editing department.  It's not too bad but for a comedy it was pretty bad.  I'll give it a 4.5 out of 5. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie a lot. I feel like it's a movie about the struggles we all go through in life. That's the main theme. The movie has a few plot holes but they don't take a lot of time to explain them. I found it interesting to see how a little girl can handle the bullying she has as a result of her physical appearance. It was very cute. I felt a lot for this girl who tried to grow up so fast. But, at the same time, she still tried to make herself look like a normal kid. As a matter of fact, the first time the bullies saw her, they didn't see a normal little girl. They just saw a child that couldn't fight back. That was the first thing that bothered them. But she had something else that frightened them a lot: her mother. That mother just couldn't see how she was trying to make her life. This little girl just wanted to be a normal girl. That just wasn't possible. The main thing was how she handled her problems. She was still struggling with it when the movie ends. It wasn't until she got older that she was able to handle being bullied. It's been five years and she's still trying. It took me a long time to like this movie. After seeing how her mother treated her, I was not sure how I could like it as a child. But this girl has grown up so much. That she's not bullied anymore, at least, I think she is. I enjoyed watching her try to make it through life. There were a couple of small things that bothered me but they were small. I loved how she got over the bullying. I was glad she found the strength to deal with her problems and that she can now live a normal life. The only thing that's bothering me about the movie is the amount of money it had. I know that it's about money but this was a waste of $20 to see this movie with my daughter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a good idea for a movie about a man who runs a circus and who is also a clown.   The first half is the clown's world and he is a little strange.  He does not know a thing about normal life and he does not realize how dangerous life is.  The clown and his animals take a break in a deserted town where there are many abandoned houses.  They spend their time in fun and games with the children.  After the children leave, they start to go crazy and they don't go away until the end of the movie.  This is a very good movie but I would have liked to see a little more action but this is a good comedy.

The acting is pretty good and there's enough gore for me to want to see more. There is some nice music. There are a couple of interesting scenes that I like and if they don't have you jumping around the theatre screaming at the screen you should be okay.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic, an action film that is so satisfyingly bad it's fantastic.   In a way, it resembles "Maverick", but with more guns and a more "gritty" vibe.  In fact, that's what it is - a gritty action movie.  The movie opens with a police chase across the city.  As the car speeds down a hill, the car gets stuck in a ditch, and the cops start shooting at the car.  One of the officers, a character who has a lot of charisma, is about to give a gun to his partner.  Then a woman pulls over and gets a gun for him too.  But the police officers don't stop, and even as they are shooting, we see a policeman shooting a thug.  When one of the police shoots the thug, he turns around and runs, but the cop follows him down the hill, shooting him as he goes down.  There is a very violent scene where a bunch of cops are chasing down a guy and shoot at him as they're running.  They take the guy down, shoot him again, and take his gun.  And then he gets up and runs.  It's a brutal scene, and there is some pretty heavy violence throughout, but it is in the interest of the film, and when they shoot the guy again, it just seems like a necessary part of the movie, rather than a cheap cheapo version of something else.  For the most part, they are pretty good cops who just keep shooting.  Sometimes they shoot in the same area of the body a lot - but there is a big shootout with a bunch more police, and those are pretty cool too.   When the police are shooting at us, they use shotguns, and they don't really hit anything.  I do remember a lot from my years in Vietnam, and I still have a bad stomach when I hear a gunshot, but I can't even recall what gun or bullet it was that was firing.  Well, the movie is about this guy (Paul Newman) who gets caught up in the police chase, and ends up in a gunfight on a bridge.  He gets shot, and is then left for dead on the bridge.   We then cut to a black-and-white flashback sequence that explains how his wife died in a car crash, and it is kind of a weird little story (I mean, it's like the movie version
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a wonderful watch and a great example of how a movie is made. It is quite a while before we see the real story behind this movie, it is only revealed in a very funny way (well, I would say "we" don't see the story at all). It's good, but there are many things it does not do well: the storyline is far too obvious, the acting is bad and the special effects (with the help of the CGI) are very poor. But it is a very good movie and one that I would recommend to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An all-around decent movie. It wasn't bad, it was alright.   In this movie we follow an unemployed guy named David that has been given a job at a fast food restaurant. His first customer is a pretty girl named Jenny (Riley Keough) who he can't help but flirty with. He has never been to the city before and his friend, Sam (Peter Farrelly), tells him that he can get a good job at the Big O. David is excited but at the restaurant he finds himself being played for a fool by a young waitress named Jenny. After he is humiliated he goes to an arcade that they have in the restaurant for some revenge and meets a guy named Jim (Ben Johnson). This leads David to a job with the Big-O where he is given the task of replacing a big, old, mean old boss (Richard Crenna) who is retiring. He is to clean out the storeroom and get rid of all the old trash. David and Jim soon begin to develop an attraction to each other but they both have to work together for this to work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    -  I don't watch horror movies very often because, frankly, the genre just lacks any interesting plot, however, I had the pleasure of watching this one, and it is an excellent movie. It's the story of a serial killer in a small American town and the victim (the main character, a beautiful young woman) is his first victim, which makes him decide to go on a spree of murders. The movie takes place in a series of scenes, and is very interesting, as the story is told from the character's point of view, which keeps the audience interested and the characters are believable.   I'd suggest the movie, as it is a decent film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked this movie. It's pretty simple and it is pretty simple. It is about a man named Jeff who loves the idea of a giant mechanical arm that will kill him if he gets out of the house. He is being chased by police officers, the police have a car, and Jeff is getting caught in the headlights. He tries to tell them about the giant arm, but they just look at him with indifference. He takes a shower and then thinks about a ride back to his house. When he gets back to the house, there is no sign of the police and there are no footprints, but there is a very odd smell in the air. Jeff goes out in the house and takes a look at his house and it appears to be completely destroyed. He then heads over to the police station to report that he has seen a giant arm and it doesn't look like it is going to work. The police start chasing him, but Jeff doesn't seem to care. Finally he just says to the officer that he isn't going anywhere. He gets back home, throws some of his money away to get a new television, and then he thinks about the arm again. He goes back to a bar to watch TV but there's no one there, but his favorite shows are on. Finally his eyes get opened and he decides to go down into his basement and look at the arm. He finds a room full of wires and things connected to the arm that look as though they were taken from a house. The arm is connected to a computer by wires so that it will work and it all makes perfect sense. He plugs it in, it works and he takes a picture of the arm in his basement. He calls his friend, Dave, who is a robot who is just a little bit more human and friendly than the others. The guys go down to Jeff's house and Jeff decides to play a game with Dave. He says it is the perfect game, as the people who live in the other houses are all dead, but the arm knows all of them and Jeff can tell the difference between the living and the dead. He throws some money at the machine and it has a big smile on its face and tells Jeff that it is all good.    Posted by Dan at 5:54 PM

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie: I went to see this movie for the first time in 3 years (it was also my birthday, so I did a few happy birthday shows around the theater, and then went to the movie for a few hours). It was not only a great movie, but also an interesting one. The premise is that the entire movie is about a group of people who are in a circus, and the only way they escape is with a rope with a large number of hooks. They have to find an escape device to help them escape, and it all begins when they come across the circus troupe. The movie has a really funny beginning with the guy who is in charge of the circus, but after about the 3rd or 4th time he is in a horrible position. He makes the circus look like a nice place to live, and is a good guy, he is very friendly to everybody. And that is about it, he just sits around doing nothing, and does not even seem to be in a position to help anyone else. He does not talk to anybody, he does not help anyone, he seems to think he is the best of everything, and he is wrong, he could have helped his friends, he even thought about doing something like rescuing a young girl, he had just seen her being thrown into a water tank at the other end of the stage, and she was about to die, and even though he is an idiot (not because of his stupid antics, but because he does stupid things like he thinks he is always right) he still does nothing. That is until his friend is in trouble, and instead of helping her he jumps into the tank and drowns it. After that he is ready to do anything. The whole circus thing is pretty silly, but it does not take long for him to realize his mistake, and try to correct it. He is the only one who is able to do this, and that is when the story really starts to get good, he starts talking to everybody, and trying to help people. It was very interesting to see a guy who could not really do anything, but is willing to do whatever it takes to help the people around him. The story goes on for a while, and eventually gets to a place where the group (he and his friends) gets out of the tank, and do not have to get out of it on their own. After a while they get bored, and decide to make a fire to try

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the final installment of a series of very well made "action" movies, the series focuses on the exploits of a man named Jim, who is hired by a CIA agent to kill his brother who is a Russian spy for the Russians. This is pretty typical spy movie stuff, but with one exception.   At one point, Jim tells his friend that he will kill the man's brother, and at another point he tells the CIA agent that he won't get out of his car until he has killed the man.  And then, it happens.  One of the Russians, an undercover agent, shoots his brother, then fires his gun at Jim. He manages to shoot him in the neck, then a shot through his leg, then another shot through the back of his head.  A lot of blood and gore and bad guy killing.  It was done in a very realistic and realistic way, and it gave the movie an emotional punch.  Another thing, that made this movie a real winner, was Jim's reaction to what just happened. He ran out of the car, ran to the edge of the road, and began to cry like a baby.  When Jim gets to his car, he sees his dead brother lying there in his own blood.  He gets out, gets in his car and drives away, tears in his eyes, tears on his cheeks, the entire time saying things like "I am sorry, I'm sorry, and I don't think you understand how I feel."  He drives for a while, then turns around and runs back into his car.  Then he sits in the car and cries.  This is a movie, where there is a very strong "action, adventure, murder" and romance story going on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a great movie with an unusual plot.   As the name implies, this is the story of a man who wakes up from a coma and comes back to life.  In order to do this, he has to work his way up through a series of jobs, from working as a clerk to a clerk at a bank, then eventually getting a job as a policeman, but this doesn't help him become normal. He gets so good at his job that he is promoted to a higher rank, but then, on a dark night in the city, he sees a black dog with a big white tail. He calls his partner, who is on a night shift, and orders him to check out a black kitten who was abandoned there. As they go to get the kitten, they see a woman standing there in the street and they think it is the girl from the kitten.  When they come back to the scene, the woman is gone and they realize that there is a hole in the sidewalk where the woman used to stand. The man goes to investigate and finds a dead body, but is too scared to look at the body because it is in his line of sight.  Eventually, the man realizes that the cat is not dead but is in a room in the bank.  It is an old woman and she has been there all along. She wants the old man to find a way to take her back to her home, but he can't find a reason to stop her.  So the cat goes on to find the woman.  Once she has found her, the cat can no longer follow her. It comes back up to the street, and she starts moving toward a man standing there.  The man knows her from her family and decides to follow her, and they end up in an alley, and the cat comes upon the man.  There are some big things happening in this movie that seem to indicate the whole movie is a dream of a normal man coming to life out of a coma. The way the cat was able to find its way out of the alley is a little unusual, though.  Some of the dialog is interesting, but I think that the ending would have worked better if it were less dramatic.  This is a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie.   This movie really got me on a lot of level.  This has a lot to offer.  One of the many things i like about this movie is the fact that it does not focus on a few characters who are really hot. This movie focuses on a huge ensemble of characters that have alot of depth to them.  Also this movie really makes a point about how it is better to give a man what he wants rather then get what he doesn't want.  What this movie does is it lets a small group of people go to a big city called London and they discover a secret that is so huge, it is a very good movie. The film does a great job at capturing how we view the world.  If you want to see a movie about how we really view the city then this is the movie for you.  The story is told by the main characters as they go on a job that is very important to society. This job has a very negative effect on the city and to top it off, a very large number of people are killed.  It is an extremely slow movie so don't expect it to move fast.  There are many different characters and the story is presented in such a way that it is easy to follow.  My favorite part of this movie are the flashbacks and it is great to see how the people of London are reacting to what is happening there.  In conclusion this is a really great movie. If you love movies that are slow and are about a big group of characters then I recommend this movie for sure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can see the true genius of the movie - I don't know how the writers managed to make this movie with the crazy story line, but they did, and they did a fantastic job, so I give them props. I'm also going to say that the director has a good eye for editing, and the music is really good, which is another thing that impressed me.   I'm not too familiar with the Star Trek universe. My mom, on the other hand, loves it. And if you are a Trekkie like me, you'll like this movie.

There were a few "horror movies" out there that had been out for a while and i wanted to see one of them and this movie was a little bit "too" much. But for a "horrible" movie it is not, it was very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For me, there's no movie more magical than Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. The story of Jumanjibox: The Series was one of the most charming ones that I'd seen in a while. As usual, we get our beloved main characters and the journey of all of us to find them a new home is full of adventures and laughter and magic. The soundtrack was excellent, the movie itself was full of laughs and we even get a glimpse of another girl: Daphne.   If you're a fan of Disney movies, you'll enjoy this movie: a must watch for any Disney fan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is just so good that I could not stop watching it until it was over. There is so much happening here, it is quite easy to follow and to understand what is going on.   What is amazing about this movie is the fact that it makes you feel that the characters are real, not just made up in your head. The dialogues are actually very realistic, which I never thought possible.  I never thought of the word'real' in the context of a movie before, but it just does not seem out of place here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You may think that I am lying when I say that I was in awe at the way that the director, William A. Wellman, handled the material.  The plot follows a group of young, innocent people who are traveling through the forests, where they are befriended by a group or giants.  When they return home the giants take the boys and the giant is none too pleased when they refuse to help him in his efforts to destroy the village.  One of the young boys is then seen fighting with a giant in a battle which he loses.  Then the giant goes back to the village to kill the rest of the villagers in a brutal fashion.  There are no dialogue in the film so it is pretty hard to figure out who is talking to whom but I think it worked really well.  It has been a long time since I have seen a movie which made me go to the theater with a feeling of hope and love.   I think that all in all I am going to come back to this movie again in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is awesome. If you love zombies and zombies movies then you should watch this. It is a good sequel to Zombieland. The cast was really good. I liked that they were not playing the same characters. Some of them had not played a zombie before but they all seemed to have the right knowledge about zombies. I don't think the movie has a real ending. The zombie is still alive. I would have liked it to end when all the zombies are dead or the heroes defeated. I think I will be watching this movie again! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting something a little more subtle in this, and i guess i'm pleased that it was.   The film's premise is as follows:  It's the year 2001. I work in a small country town named Bensalem. The only thing in town is an abandoned church. This abandoned church is actually a living, breathing organism, filled with children of varying ages.  In this, it is the local school, the town, and the world that they live in.  This is a story of a boy named Ben. Ben, is a normal boy who has been forced to leave his home and come to this strange world called "New Jersey".  He and his friends have to solve the mystery of the new town, find the missing boy, and find the love of their lives.  The movie is pretty simple in the beginning, but soon you see that this is an incredibly touching movie. The film is a mix of comedy, drama, love, sadness, and even a little bit of mystery. Ben is a great character and I was impressed by how he was portrayed. He doesn't act like a typical boy. He's a little shy, and sometimes he is a little too passive, but his determination and love for others is very endearing. The music was good as well.  Overall this is a very touching and emotional film.  Recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It's like an extended episode of one of my favorite shows, Family Guy. It follows the story of a boy who becomes a dinosaur after his dad and brother have an accident. This makes him a lot more human but still a dinosaur, just without any wings. I liked the movie a lot. It was very funny and had a good message about the dangers of being a big man in a small world. I also found myself crying a lot at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not expecting this to be an awesome movie, I was expecting a great movie. What I got was something really cool.   This movie is not a great, it is good.  I mean I really do think it was made by some people that knew how to direct, the movie is very good. You may think that the story is stupid, but I say it's not. It is very much a thriller and it is a very good movie.  It is not too long and it takes a while to get to it, but the movie really gets going.  Also, the voice acting, the cinematography and the sound effects were well done, not the greatest, but it was all pretty good. It may take a little while for you to warm up to the story, but once you do, the story will blow your mind.

It's a really decent movie for an average budget. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good, but not as good as     The Thing  . You would have expected a movie like this to be more action than horror.   The movie has some action, but the horror is what drives it.  A group of friends go on a camping trip. They go to the park and a group of creatures begin to attack them. At the very end of the movie they get in a fight with these creatures and survive.  You don't have to watch this movie to get some ideas, but it is good to see them in action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie a week ago and it's already one of my favorites! I haven't seen a movie like it yet, this movie is hilarious, it's funny, it has a lot of heart. I think it is amazing that this movie was made in the 70s, it feels like a real 70s movie, but it is more mature and mature is the best word for it. The sex scenes are very creative, it looks like a lot went down and you're still in control. The story is very fun, it shows that a lot is out there to say, this is a very good movie. The only thing that I would change is the ending. I liked it better when they took it to a more adult place, but I like the idea of a good, well-liked friend of a girl.

They get into a bad accident and end up stuck in a car with a group of people. Things don't seem to be that bad when they get there. The director of the movie knows how to make this movie easy to enjoy.   The two girls are pretty and beautiful, they also do not let the bad guys win in the movie.  There are some nice shots in the first half of the film which is why you keep watching.  And a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film that's better than its creator intended it to be:  I thought "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" was a brilliant piece of filmmaking. The story of Tom Gordon is a very interesting one. It's about a young girl who is a bit of a misfit in a small town. She is obsessed with Tom Gordon and has always been jealous of his popularity and love of life. After years of growing up together, Tom has been dating her and this leaves a hole in her heart. She finds a way to fix this hole in Tom's heart by writing a book about him and he becomes obsessed with the story and the author. The film has a lot of very interesting scenes such as Tom's visit to the woman of his dreams who becomes a part of the book and how he feels about himself. The cinematography is stunning. As Tom becomes obsessed in the story of his past, he becomes very vulnerable and starts to feel sorry for himself. It makes the viewer wonder what is really going on with this girl and it makes for a great story.   After watching "The Boy Who Lived" and "The Woman Who Lied" I was thinking that it was just a story and not really about anything else. The plot is weak but the characters were fine and it was well done.  I was not too impressed with the ending. I don't think Tom Gordon should have been murdered at the end of the film. I guess the police were not sure what to do after they found out about the murder, so they thought they had a serial killer on their hands. I'm not sure that I think Tom was murdered but it was a bit odd because the ending didn't seem to fit the movie and I found that kind of a bummer.  One of the most interesting things about the film was the acting and the chemistry between Tom and the other characters in the film:  While I didn't think the chemistry was as good as it could have been, I still thought it was an entertaining film that should have a place on your DVD shelf. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the few Hollywood productions that could get into our heads and keep them there.   The acting is just a bit over the top, but that just goes to make them all over the world laugh.  And the movie is just so fun to watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was born on the 4th of July, 1973 in the town of Nolanda, about 40 miles west of New York City. This is the first movie I ever saw and the first I will ever watch. I loved it!   The movie is about two young men, Jerry and Bob, who, in their college years, become best friends. Bob starts talking about a girlfriend he was going to marry and how much he was in love with her. Jerry says that they should see her, but she's busy making plans with someone else. They then decide to meet up at a bar to hang out and drink until she shows up. When she shows, she's really gorgeous and Jerry becomes fascinated with her (and she, in turn, becomes fascinated by Jerry). When the girl shows up, Bob and Jerry decide to have a little fun and go to bed together while Bob watches TV. When Bob returns, he sees a guy who looks exactly like the girl he was watching and he says, "Oh, that's Jerry" and goes to get her for sex. The girl, whom Bob never met, then comes up and says, ""Oh, you're Jerry" again. Bob decides to go to her apartment and meet her there for sex and the rest is history. I saw this movie when I was 11. It was in 3D, and I had never seen a 3D movie before then. That is, until I saw the 3D version of it.    - Michael G. Posted by Joe F. at 10:18 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a sucker for this movie. I've heard nothing but good things about it. Well, that's one of my biggest criticisms for this film: I don't think it's all that good. It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't do anything new. There are a few plot points that come and go. One or two good things happen, but nothing else really happens. It seems that there is an original story and story elements are scattered here and there throughout, but there really isn't much in the way of plot or characters that I can relate to or like. I don�t think it was very well-written in either the book or film. The voice of the protagonist is very bland, and it isn't hard to see where a lot of the story is really taking place, so it�s not hard to put the characters together. I liked the film a lot. It was funny and it was enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story:  The plot is quite straight forward. A father is trying to figure out how his daughter got a bad name and his son is trying his best to get it right. There are some good moments of the father getting his daughter to change her name. But I was not in for the story.  I think the main reason for my dislike was the fact that I didn't like the guy's family.   I don't like it when people are nasty to people and mean them bad for no reason.  The acting:  I like this guy's acting.  His lines were good enough for me to believe that he was really trying to help the girl out.  And his family's demeanor was a little silly too.  It was a good laugh.    The characters:    I liked the characters. I like the fact he really tried to help his daughter change her nickname.  Their son was cute enough to me. He just got me the wrong way.  They both were annoying. They were so mean to each other.  When I first watched this movie I got a good chuckle out of the fact the dad and his daughter would often argue. I couldn't tell who was being mean.  A friend of mine told me she thought they were like two drunk idiots.  This isn't a movie to watch with a group of friends. It is best enjoyed with just one or two people.  Score: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has everything: suspense, romance, an intelligent protagonist and some good jokes, and you never know what's coming next.   The main hero, a detective, gets a strange case. He goes to a place where the spirits of the murdered people hang out and finds that one of them is dead but not really. He decides to investigate this place for a little while and finds a murder that's really bad...   As the movie progresses, more and more mysteries are opened up. As the murderer is about to be found, he suddenly disappears. There's a lot of suspense here...and some laughs, but not all of them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen several great movies this year in the horror and thriller genres, and the best one, "The Cabin in the Woods" (2008) might actually be one of my top 3 all time films. It starts off pretty great with a character called Will (Josh Peck) a boy who gets trapped in a cabin with other children of a family who are being terrorised by a family of cannibals who have come to town looking for a human sacrifice to bring back to the tribe to revive the old god god (as they call it). The story progresses really fast and moves from one extreme to another with some great effects and some great character work and performances. I loved this movie so much I went back to it a couple of times and re-watched it to find out who killed the little boy in the first half of the film and what the whole family was about. When I saw the trailer for "Cabin in the Wood", I instantly knew it would be a hit and go kind of a movie but with the scares, creepy scenes and just a little twist of some dark themes and things to bring them down to earth. And yes it did! It was a really well made horror movie. I was not really prepared for how creepy it was at first but after about 10 minutes, I was ready for some scares. The actors were fantastic, even some of the family members did good work in the movie and the effects were pretty good. I wish I had seen it sooner to finish this review but with its release on the big screen, I hope I will get a chance to go again soon!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a group of children and their parents visiting a park called "The Great White," which was once a place of peace and serenity until it was destroyed in a mysterious explosion. The children discover that the park has been turned into a ghost town and the children decide to explore the ruins.   The film features the children's teacher (Dianne Harris) and her husband (Roddy McDowall), who try to prevent their children from getting involved in the ghost hunting.  When the children find the ruins, they find a strange creature that appears to be a little kid. It takes a while before they figure out that it is actually the remains of a lost love.  After the child is eaten, the kids decide to go after the missing girl.  They find her wandering alone. The family takes her to a strange man named Johnny who is supposed to have been the caretaker of the park. He seems to know everything. The girls have to deal with the effects of the creature's curse and discover that this creature isn't actually a little girl. The film ends with the group going back to the park and figuring out how to get out of it and return to normal.  The film's final shot is a real winner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie!   It wasn't that scary and I enjoyed it a lot!  When I watched it a while ago, I thought the movie was going to be more of a action movie because there was a girl who is trying to save her friends from a bunch of crazy guys and then she gets to be on a mission and it is to rescue her friends.   Her whole story was just too cute.  So now, the movie is about two friends and their journey to find a new home to live together.  The movie has a very good plot and really does bring about a lot of fun!  The music in the movie has so many songs that I'm really enjoying the songs!  I'm not a very big fan of horror movies so I wasn't really interested in this movie.  This is a really fun movie to watch and it definitely has a good plot to it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found myself in a great movie from the beginning, from the very first scene. I don't think that there's any other movie that has an opening like that, you could be in a movie called "My Man Is a Werewolf" and it's the same story. The first 30 seconds of a movie are all about a young man who meets a beautiful woman. His friend comes in and says, "This guy is creepy". He says, 'Well, he has to be, he was the boyfriend of one of my sisters'." This friend ends up not liking him. He starts to cry, and this boy leaves. He comes home one day and says "I was going to tell you a story about a time I met a girl who has a special ability". I don´t know if I said this right or not, but this guy is really cool. He has a dark hair and dark eyes, and he´s wearing a black trench coat. He tells his story in a very cool way and I think it's a good story. He describes how he met this girl, how he fell in love with her and how she tried to hide this from him, but he found it out, he found her hiding, and what happened was that her boyfriend tried to kill her with a hammer! It was really cool! I love that story! It doesn´t seem to be a very well known story, but the fact that a story like that is told, you really learn a lot about a character. I really liked the story of this guy. He was cool and likeable. And even though the story is not very well written, I still found it a good film to watch.

Now, when I see the cast (except for the girl who is still alive today) re-assembled for a DVD release, I am shocked that they all retained their original voices. It is even more surprising that they did not need to do a new soundtrack for this movie, because I really enjoyed it even more with the old one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife & I went to this movie on our recent vacation in the state of Colorado. Our family stayed in a nice hotel and had fun watching the movie with the two kids. I'd say we had a good time. The movie was a decent family film, and the story was fun, but the ending was so out of character that I felt like I was watching a different movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film opens with a strange sequence of images (most of them are the same, only the colours are different) in the middle of a field. We see two bodies being dragged through a grassy field, being picked up and dropped down again. The camera pans back and forth, and finally pans through a hole in the sky and shows us a bird's-eye view of a large building. The image goes out, and we're back in the field. There's a car passing, and a police car comes out and pulls up in front of the house. The driver is the policeman, and there's an open door in the front seat. The scene changes, we see the woman in the next bed. She's dressed in a nightgown, and is being watched by a man in a white uniform. The woman doesn't reply. The man is looking at the house through a window, and he seems to have a strange look about him. The policeman appears out of the open door, and asks the man to give him a name. The next scene shows the policeman entering the house with a man who is trying to wake the woman up. The house is on fire. The police officer looks over the flames, and then he's seen in the darkness, and goes out. In the next scene we see a policeman and a man outside the house, who are arguing. The cop asks the driver if he's afraid to burn down the house he lives in. The other man says: "I am afraid to die". We see the two policemen going back inside the house and getting out. Then we see an image of a couple in a bath tub, with the woman sitting in the tub and looking at a man. She looks up at him, and the image goes from man to woman, then back to the man, and so on. They're all looking at each other, with no one looking at her. At last they're back outside the door to the house (which is closed), with the man saying: "The house is burning down around me!" and the policeman saying: ""What house? Who did that?" And they don't know what house to go to next. The firemen arrive and are there for about a minute. The scenes come back in a dream sequence, with a young man on a train. He's looking for a woman (the image of the woman is a woman in a dressing gown) and he's stopped by a policeman.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was. It's got that "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" feel to it that we want to see more of from them. You know, with a few better actors and some more interesting sets, I think this could be the next best thing to that movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie a week ago, it's the first part of a series called "The Dark World" which I was really excited about, but I have to say, it is a bit of a let down, but still a good thriller/horror movie with plenty of action.    This is a pretty decent movie, with enough scares for the fans of the dark and eerie movies, but it isn't so bad that you just have to skip it.  The good:  The action in this movie is very well done, but the actors are pretty poor, and I think that they should have taken some time off and tried to find better acting roles.  This movie was a little disappointing to me, and it wasn't bad by any means, it had some pretty good scares, but not enough action, or great scary moments.  It was ok, but you could definitely tell that they were trying to make a more mature and serious movie, but they didn't really pull it off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that a lot of people will find this movie "a little strange". A "little strange" is a good thing. A little strange is good. However, "A Little Strange" is not a movie that you can just sit down and watch.   It has a lot more going on than meets the eye.  I am not going to attempt to describe the plot.  It is just that good.  First of all, the movie has an "X-Files" feel to it. I don't want to say too much about it, but I will say a few things. This movie is very different from many of the other "A" movies.  What is interesting about it is that the "A"-group seems to be operating more like a "private investigation" type of group rather than a paranormal group.  Their activities are all about solving puzzles, but they also have some sort of a relationship with a human being. This human being appears to be a very good detective, although it is only shown in brief flashbacks. I suppose that if the film did not end at the end of the credits (the last scene is about a whole week's worth of "A") we would be getting closer to the mystery.  In addition to that, the film is a lot darker than "A". This makes it a great "drama", but I am going to warn you now.  This movie, to me, has a strong anti-hero.  However, this anti-good does not seem to get along with the other good and the bad.  To the "people" of this world, the "bad" does not have a soul, nor is it evil.  The good seems to have a "spirit".  This "spirit" is very good and helps the "anti-hero" solve some of the "problems" in the world.  One of the more interesting things about this is that even though the "antipope" is trying to do something good, the people around him are always trying to screw him over.  Finally, the anti-anti is good, but not perfect. He is human.  Again, I do not want to spoil the fun for you by trying to describe a whole movie.  But I have to warn any potential viewers that there are parts of this movie that I do find "strange."  But again, I give this movie a thumbs up for a great mystery
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't watched an Australian movie in some time, and while I love a good Australian movie, this was a decent movie for a laugh.   If you're like me and love watching Aussie movies for the laughs, this one was good.  For the most part, the story was good and didn't have a real story. It was a fun movie with a few funny bits. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My mother and I drove up to Hollywood for an outing in a convertible to catch the movie of a lifetime. After spending a day in the beach town of Malibu, we traveled out to the hills of Malabar (one of the more scenic places I've ever been). The scenery was amazing, the sun shining in the valley below us and the stars overhead. All the sights were spectacular, even a couple of snakes! A lot of people I've seen have talked about "the beauty" of Malindi but for those of us who lived in the desert areas for most of our lives, the beauty was a new experience. We even made a day trip out to Santa Cruz, CA for a couple nights of beach fun, I was glad to get out to a place where people still lived the way they did when we were kids. The film in a nutshell is a beautiful tale about a little girl who is given an island by her uncle and decides to raise a little boy.   I could have given a better review than I did, but I didn't know what to expect from the movie, it was a very well produced movie and the actors, singers, and director all do an outstanding job. I'm just so happy to have seen the film and I will definitely go to the theater to watch it again!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't mean to be a jerk and to tell you how to live your life. I mean, the movie is so good it will change your life for the better. It will change the way you look at your life forever. You'll go, "Wow! That guy was in that movie. I bet if he was in real life he'd be just as cool." It doesn't have to be like this though. I'd love to live in a world without war, the police are a bunch of bullies, and everybody is miserable. This movie has that in spades! It's a lot of fun and really makes you think about how we should live our lives. I couldn't recommend it more.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good-looking movie. The plot is simple, but does have a dark, violent side. I liked the way that the actors (especially the kids) acted. The story was simple. The kids are in a farmhouse when their neighbor, a girl (played by a lovely actress) gets kidnapped by two boys. The boy (played again by a nice young actor) tries to protect the girl from the boys, but gets himself killed and the girls are taken to a town where they must live in the same house with their crazy (but lovely) neighbor. She seems nice enough, but they keep the house in the dark because her parents are away. It turns out she is a witch, but that is not all. The neighborhood is in a civil war and she is in love with a girl from another town who is a murderer. It is a small story, with some good acting and a cute movie, but it is not a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a wonderful film that I have had many enjoyable movies to watch but I have never seen anything like it before. I love it. I was truly in love with this movie. This is the type of movie that you watch after a hard day of work. This was a real treat to watch. It was so much fun to watch the great movie I just wish it was longer. It would have been great. A real treat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is based on a book called, How To Tell a Good Story. The movie is all about the story itself, and it makes for a nice experience.   I recommend watching this one with a nice cup of tea or coffee.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been in love with this film since I first watched it. It's a wonderful piece of film-making. The story, although it seems somewhat simple at first glance, is actually quite complex, with many layers to peel off. In addition, the acting is fantastic, from the main star, to the supporting actors, to all of the people in the streets, and all over the world, who are looking to see their leaders make a mistake. It truly feels like a world of its own.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason I didn't give this a 10 star is because it's a really long movie and if you watch it in a short period of time, you may need a break, but it will last you at least two hours.   If this movie had been cut down to ten minutes or less, it would have been a perfect movie.  This movie is really about life and the characters.  And the whole film is about how they all try to make a life for themselves and it's really sad. I think the director did this movie to make people laugh and cry. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I've seen.   The movie is a bit slow and some of the acting is pretty good, and the movie is pretty funny and very well made.  I like how they made the movie a short film, so that is where I put it to get the audience engaged. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My two young boys were very happy to see a movie that reminded them of a trip they had to take with their parents when they were in kindergarten (yes, really, in a movie about the history of the American West) and made us think of another vacation they had with their father in France when they lived there.   There was a bit of action but it was pretty tame.  I thought it was fun to see two grown men (and it seemed like it) fighting a lot for a girl, who was clearly trying to kill them, and to see the "lady" (forgive me if I'm being melodramatic) trying to outsmart the men by using her wits.  There were also a number of good one liners.  Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie. I knew I had to wait until the movie was actually released and I got to see it when it finally was released.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think it was bad at all, until I finished it.   The actors in this movie were not good.  I thought that we should have more "cute" actors in it instead of the lame ones that always try to play their "nose".   This movie should have been called "Punishing the Virgin".  This is a movie which shows what can happen to a young girl if she is not careful.  This woman is only 11 years old and she is being stalked by a 16 year old boy. He is not a bad boy, but his father is a real bad guy, and his mother is very cruel to the girl, and that makes the girl feel very lonely.  She has to sneak around to escape from the house.  But her mother and father aren't home.  They have left on a long trip. She knows that they will be back in a little while, but she has to go out of the house and hide from the boy's father. She can't go out because the boy can hear her hiding from the window and he comes to the house to catch her.  He knows what she is doing, but he also wants to be a good boy, so he is trying to protect her. At the end of the movie, the girl is captured by the boy who is now her father.  It is an easy movie to understand, but it has a nasty plot.  The boy is an evil kid who really thinks that he is a good person.  In this movie, I felt that it was a little too long and I wished they would have filmed it with more time.  However, the movie was fun to watch, and it was better than I expected. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie that has a very unique style that was great.   The movie was very good, but I do think that there was a bit of a weak spot when the story got to the part with a child trying to help his friend.  I really like the idea of the movie, but the ending really got under my skin. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A man (Robert Redford) decides to quit drinking and be a better man, while a young female companion (Jodie Foster) tries to get a job and a boyfriend (Michael Rennie) becomes a suspect for a murder.   This is an excellent drama, well written and acted by all actors.  It has a real romance and lots of suspense. It makes you feel like you are in the middle of a story and you want to get caught up on everything.  A real great film with a nice twist at the end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, then you'll love this one.   The movie was so good, in fact, that I even thought about buying the original trilogy on DVD.  But I have always felt that George Lucas was over-reaching when he took over the film.  His first Star Wars movie didn't really seem like a sequel to the original but rather a remake of it.  He also took many of the concepts from the original and added them to his own world and created his own "original" story.  There is a lot of science-fiction in this movie, from the spacecraft and the power of the force to the giant space battles.  The music is amazing.  George Lucas even created a whole new trilogy of films around the idea of a kid trying to save the galaxy.  It's one of the greatest space opera/action movies ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great romantic drama that could not be more different from a bunch of romantic-comedy comedies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There is a moment in which an American reporter, in a car driven by a British colleague, spots a man being attacked in a country-side by men with pitchforks. One of the men is about to cut the man's throat. The reporter stops the car, and runs for the hills. In his chase the British journalist is attacked, and falls down a steep hill. He is saved by a pair of German shepherds. 'I've lost my feet!' he exclaims. 'But this is a bad situation. I am a good American. You'd like me for an editor!' 'A writer,' they say. The German shepherd leads him to a castle. Inside the castle he is served tea by a servant. The servant opens a door. The American reporter enters. The two shepherd boys run at the American. They carry him to the courtyard, where they tie him to some spikes. But then a man climbs up on the spikes, and they release him. The man is the King of France. They bring him to their master. He has a gun, and the American has a pistol. But they have a pistol of their own. 'Don't shoot!' he says to them. 'You're not going to shoot me. I'm an American, and I'm a good man.' The King is indignant. 'If I shot you I would shoot you all,' he shouts. 'There are more good men in France than in the United States. They are the only men who can help me.' The American asks, 'Do you not believe in the Englishman's God?' 'Yes, but I don't believe in his God's God.' 'I don't understand you. Why don't you believe in God?' The King laughs. 'No, I don`t believe in your God. I don´t believe any God. But I believe in my King.' 'Well, I'm sure you are a very nice man,' the American says. 'In the first place I would like to tell you that your country is not like yours. It is more like Germany. You have all your churches; I have none. All I have are our dogs, my men, my boys.' 'Do the dogs like the men?' 'Of course they do! But I can't allow them to eat our children. In this country the dogs have their own religion. The children don't go to church. There are
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would highly recommend this movie. This movie is not as good as the previous two films in this trilogy, but it is still a decent movie. It has great animation, excellent voice acting, and a very interesting plot. This film has a more serious tone to it than the first two movies did. The story is much more mature and the characters seem more mature in the movie as well. The movie has very good music, a lot of different tunes that make it feel very fresh, and it is a very well done movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the original "Die Hard" then you will like "DieHard 3". But the changes are minimal. A lot of the actors are the same: Bruce Willis, John McClane, Linda Hamilton and Bruce Willis. This is the third sequel to the original movie so they must have worked on some things, which make this one more like the first movie. But I think "Die hard" is still a great action movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last few months were not a good time to be a Batman fan. First it was that the film that they produced with David Ayer, in the dark and grimy style of Sylvester Stallone's "Planes" (1977), turned out to be just a little too dark for some people. Then they made a very silly "Justice League" (2013), which I found to be pretty good. Then there was a Batman movie that I thought was good, with a couple of scenes that were well done, but also somewhat stupid and inelegant, and so I thought that this new movie that Zack Snyder and David A. Goodman made, in their dark and gritty style, was a better one.   One thing that really bothered me, was that while I didn't hate the story of this movie, I thought it was a very poor one. And I am not a Batman guy, so I didn' t know how to feel about it, and I didn" t care what the writer intended.  I don't care much for Snyder" s style. He likes to play with his actors, and he likes to get them to look different, and in this film he gets a couple that look different. For instance, Jesse Eisenberg was playing a very good Lex Luthor.  And while the rest of the cast were really good, I found it a little annoying that they kept introducing the same two characters over and over.  But there is one guy who is really interesting in this movie. Michael Shannon who played James Gordon was great.  As was the music by the late Christopher Guest and by a little band called the Tambourine Guys.  It really worked and was really catchy.  There was an interesting plot, and at the end, they brought out the Joker.  This movie is very serious and it makes you feel really guilty about your bad behavior.  My only gripe with this movie was that at times, it seemed to be missing a certain element. And this element is called "fun."  As a viewer, I wanted to have a great time.  Sure I wanted the bad guy to die, but I wanted there to be some sort of a fun element.  That is something that the previous movies didn"t have.  The only problem is that Snyder"s film never seems to get there, it seems to be more serious than the others, so the "fun" element just seems to disappear

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that the film is worth a watch. It was funny. It had a great script and a good story. It took place in a mental hospital. The story is about a guy named Dr. Dreyfus and his "superfan" who visits his house in a motor home to watch him work on a car that he has been working on. The next morning after getting off work Dr. Dr. tries to get the guy to tell his story. However he seems to get confused and doesn't know what is going on. He is a really nice guy and I am sure he had good reasons for doing what he did. It is a little short. I would have liked to see more of his house. I think this is the best car movie ever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw "The Exorcist" in a theater at the Palace Theatre with my parents, and after being somewhat skeptical of it (even after seeing the trailer), I enjoyed it quite a lot. My favorite line in the movie is the one after the film ends: "And the world turned to shit!"   This is a really interesting and fun little story, with a lot of action, horror, and comedy.    The only criticism I can give is that I did not like the music much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing that makes The House on the Rock so special is that it is truly a one-of-a-kind film, not only from its visual and narrative style, but from the way it works in tandem with the rest of its films. The film is full of the same kind of atmosphere that was present in the first film. It feels like the entire movie was shot on film. The House is one of those films that leaves you breathless. The story follows a group of kids that make a run from the law. After all they're all just kids doing something stupid and stupid it is fun to watch.   But that's not all, The House also features a lot of great acting, but also some great music and one of the most entertaining and bizarre sequences in recent memory.  A great film that I highly recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie about life, love, family and faith.   It is about a girl, who is born into a poor family, and she wants to live her life to the fullest, but her father and older brothers, are fighting with each other and don't allow it. They also don't understand that she is not a normal little girl and that she needs to be respected, because she is strong willed and strong like the wind.  So, they go to a big city, to the school of the rich people.  When they are there, the school's boss is an old man who treats her like dirt. He has no sense of responsibility and expects her to go to his apartment and do everything he wants. But that doesn't work, because this girl is the strongest of them all and can't be put into his "house". So, she tries to make a way out of this situation.  After a while, she sees some girls who are trying to make their way out and she decides to help them.  But when she tries, the situation changes, because the boss is jealous and wants to take them all away from her.      But her sister decides to come with her, but it is not easy to get in the car.  And now, it is a race against time to get the car to the office.  The story is simple and can be explained easily, but the film is so beautiful, so moving.  It will make you tear up.  For a story about a little girl who needs a lot of love and understanding, it has a lot.  I would say that this movie is about being a girl who loves life and her big brother, who loves her a lot but is not always ready to let her do things.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. The movie does a good job at telling a good story about a boy, who is kidnapped by aliens. The plot makes you think about what is happening in the story. The aliens have a plan, that the boy is supposed to learn about. The alien has a child like look, and they teach him how to use tools. The boy is an amazing learner, and the boy seems to learn from every experience he has. I like that the movie did not get bogged down in the details of the story, but told a good plot. I can't think of anything I could add to a review about this movie, other than it being a fun sci fi movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There were moments when the movie's theme is clearly discerned, but there are times when it could not have been more apparent. What would you have thought after seeing a film about the most successful and infamous family in America?   The movie tells the story of how the Rockefellers and the Kennedys of the American Century destroyed America through a series of events that began with the murder of a young girl, ended in a massive air raid over the U.S. and, ultimately, led to the demise of a very old man. The movie has a few moments of greatness as well, such as one scene where a man in a wheelchair comes to town after having been left to die in an alleyway.   Despite the story line, the movie is more about politics, business and family than it is about the war in Vietnam.  I really enjoyed the movie and was able to sit through the most frustrating parts and not get too bored. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't been a fan of any horror movies from the 80's until this movie came out, so when I saw it I was a bit skeptical. I must say that the movie is very well made, and I must admit that I liked it a lot. The movie is about a group of college students who are on a camping trip when the group are attacked by a group called the Evil Dead. The group is divided and it's up to one of the men to stop the Evil dead and find a way home. The cast is very solid, I really enjoyed the character of Johnny (the lead actor) and his wife and the other guys who are in the group. The acting was good too, but not outstanding, and the sound was good, and that was probably the most important part of this movie. The special effects and direction were good and I found the movie to be entertaining, the movie has a horror aspect to it and I really liked it!     I have not yet seen a movie that has a different tone like this one and that is just great! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The final scene of this movie was a great scene. It was the end of the movie and the ending was a very satisfying scene.   It was one of the few times in the series that there was no cheesy music and there was the perfect ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story, and the acting, and everything about it, was just right. It has a very fast pace with lots of action and very fast paced scenes. The writing is good for the most part. When one thinks of an action movie, they think of the Die Hard and John Wayne films, but I didn't see this movie as a John Wayne, it was more of an Al Pacino type action film. He didn't look like a Wayne type action movie actor, but rather more of a Bruce Willis type character. The character of Pacino was an interesting one. His character seemed like a mixture of two men. He has his own style and his own personality and it wasn't all about him, but he was an important part of the movie. The film also had a very good ending.   For those people who haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. It isn't all action. But then again, it isn't action all the time either. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to admit, that when I watched this movie, I was worried about the direction. I'm a big fan of comedy and it's not that I don't like comedy. However, I couldn't help but worry about what the director might have been trying to do. After watching this movie I can't help to think that the director has a really tough job.    This movie is definitely worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There are few things more painful than watching a movie that tries too hard. The worst part about it is that everyone involved thinks it's a good idea. Everyone involved. Everyone in the world. Just so terribly misguided. It's a wonderful attempt at a sci-fi film, but a poor one at that. Even worse, it ends up being a poor attempt at any sort of plot. "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The most terrifying and the most sublime of horror films"   (from The New York Times)   When a small town in Alabama is hit by an epidemic of mysterious deaths, a series of bizarre events begin to unfold and make the town's residents think they're going insane. It's a classic horror movie, with good performances from John Vernon and a good plot.   The townspeople are divided between two factions: the sane, believing in ghosts, who call themselves the Salem Witches; and the crazy, who believe in a new type of devil worship, called Necromancy.

It's an unapologetic, well-researched and well-produced film about a whole bunch of people who take on the mob, and it's about as true-to-life as you can get. It has a lot of action but it's done in such a way that it is almost comic-bookish."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a pretty good little romantic comedy. The plot follows a boy who has been adopted by a woman from the countryside and raised as her son. At times he's kind of a nuisance but mostly he's an annoying little brat. A love triangle between the boy and a girl, one who has a bit of a crush on him. The boy ends up in a little cottage where all the women are quite beautiful and have a bit strange ideas about him. I won't tell you too much but if you're into this type of thing then you'll like it a lot. I'm just not that into romantic comedies myself but I'm sure you'll find something you'll love about it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The final act of this film is a total blast.   This is the third film in the "Hollywood" trilogy that makes up the "Dark Shadows Trilogy".   In this film we follow a group of high school students who have just learned the fact that they will be attending an all girls Catholic school.  The lead of the film, Amanda, is an energetic, yet socially awkward girl who is more interested in making friends with guys than with her friends.  When she meets the mysterious and attractive "Eugene", a "prodigal" and a "bad" boy who has just escaped a "freed" house and a dead parent, Amanda meets a very exciting, but difficult, situation to deal with.  The dark and stormy night in the beautiful and dark wooded island of a village on Lake Erie.  This film is probably the most interesting of the trilogy.  As soon as I saw the title of this movie I was really interested in seeing the story unfold.  In the beginning the story seems a bit "fiddly", but as the film progresses, it becomes more interesting.  Once you learn about the girls, they all come to life and the story becomes more engaging and exciting.  What I also like is how the storyline moves from point A to point B. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -It was a fun movie to watch- the film has a great plot, a great soundtrack, a well built character, and a plot that has twists that are well thought out. The music is awesome, a little too epic for my tastes, but it makes the movie work. The film is also a great romance, even though it is about a guy falling in love with a girl who's the same age, with the right amount of love interest, the movie could have been a wonderful romantic comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a pleasant surprise, and a really solid movie.   This movie is not all about the love of the country, it is about the romance of a family, who are also family to one another. I enjoyed this movie as I have a very fond memory of the film of it's time. The acting was really good, but the story was so unique, it had to be seen, and I guess it should have been done with a little more thought put into it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My daughter has no patience for the usual "girl-girl" stories that are usually the bread and butter of these type of films. She is more of a boy person and didn't really enjoy this film at all. The girl is really too flat and the boy is not what we have come to expect from a "girl to girl" type movie. The movie was not much of a good time. The girls are not too bad to look at but they are really too pretty and have no personality.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like any good movie, The Godfather: Part III has its fun moments but it also brings in a few uncomfortable and downright uncomfortable moments to spice things up.   One scene really sticks out in my mind.  It was at a restaurant where the main character is making a dinner of a spaghetti pie, a dish which is extremely popular around the Roman Empire.  The Godson: Part I had one of the most horrific scenes in recent years.  And The Goddaughter: Part II was a bit more tame.  With The Godin Part III the main characters are at a very fancy dinner table when one of them, a former servant of his, takes an interest in a very beautiful woman.  But of course the main villain doesn't go down easily.  His first attack on the unsuspecting man makes him nearly unconscious and when he manages to crawl to his feet he discovers his own wife is also the target of this attack.  Her name is Elizabeth, she's about 5'4" and 120 lbs.  When the main antagonist is done with her she proceeds to break his leg and is about to eat it.  I'm sorry, but there's no way around it. The fact that a man of that stature is trying to take a woman at his own game, is about the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.  How did he do it?  It was a pretty brutal scene to watch and one which had me in tears.  There's also a pretty sad moment that takes place in the last minute of the film that really does make me think about how one woman can make a man so mad.  A beautiful woman with an open heart and an unstoppable desire to succeed, who is very willing to destroy herself to achieve her goals.  As much as it pains me to say it, I believe that The God-Fathons' first and second parts were very good but I can't say the same about the third installment.  It's not that I'm a fan of the plot, which was never as complex as I expected it to be.  Sure, the first two parts were pretty good but they were at the expense of the characters.  They were not fully fleshed out or developed enough to give the viewer a good impression of who these people are and what motivates them.  At times, there were scenes that left me wondering if what I was seeing was even real or not.  If I had to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited to see The Dictator. I loved the first one, and I was pretty excited to get this one. It was a pretty good action movie that has some good performances. It is not too much of a bad movie either. It could use a lot more depth to the characters and their relationship. Some of the actors are also a bit flat but it gets better as it goes on.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie! It is a very fun comedy. It's one of the first I saw that was really good. I liked the main characters too. The two of them are such a good match!   This is one of those movies that people come up to and say "Man I wish I was that cool".   The first half of the movie is a lot of fun. I can't believe how fun this movie is! It has a good mix of humor and action. The funny thing is that both of the main actors can really act! The action is done with great care and it looks real. I also like that the special effects are done well. It looks like it's filmed in a dark room.   When I first saw the poster I really thought that it was a movie about a "cool" guy who had some problems and went out in search of a cooler guy who was cooler. Then they just played around in the woods and the coolest guy had a huge beard! I was surprised. The story of the film isn't very interesting. The movie really gets fun when they're playing around in a cabin in the forest. This is a movie where people are always playing around with each other. I love the fact that they get to be a little more mature than they were in the beginning of the story.  This movie was a very good way to kill time before school.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well the first two minutes is quite good. The film is a movie about a man who is lost in a maze of a town called Zokor. While wandering around looking for a way out he meets a girl who is in a coma. This is only the beginning as a horrible and weird monster starts attacking everyone and turning them into animals. The monster is called a "Chimeras" or "Ceremonial Zombies". He has a big tail and it's always going up and down in the air. He looks like a skeleton but that is a lie. He is very violent and is able to take away anything he wants and has the ability to change into various forms like a bird or a snake. I don't know how he did it but he did. He was so much more than a mere skeleton. He didn't only look like a body with a skull around it but an amalgam of all things evil. He attacked everyone he saw and was able to destroy the town.   I was not a fan of the ending of this movie, however, I did not hate it either. I liked it so much I actually did like it for it's ending.  The movie is a good horror film but I think it's just a little too short.  It would be better if they added more to it. I think the movie should have lasted for a bit longer but not too long.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see this movie last year and I love it, not just the acting. The story has to do with a woman named Ann who is suffering from a disease that has killed the only child she had with her first husband. It's a classic "cursed marriage" and we learn a lot about the character of Ann and the circumstances of her loss, as well as what her husband did in her absence. The movie also has one of my favorite music cues, "The Way My Heart Stops."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie very much.   The story, the art style and the plot were really well done. The action scenes were really good.

This movie is very entertaining, but not a good thriller. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie in a midnight show in a small town in the middle of the American midwest. I didn't see the movie last night because I was out all night drinking and my wife had to work all day today, but it's been a while since I've seen a film that has held a candle to it's predecessor (the only one I've missed is the remake of the same name) so, after a few drinks at a bar and about 3/4 of the movie, I left. But there is a big grin on my face while watching.   It's still pretty much an old-fashioned gangster movie. It's a bit more modern with the cop and his wife and his sister-in-law, but the gangster is still a man with a gun, and the bad guys are still bad guys. There is no question about the acting: the performances are very good. I don't think they are good enough to win a Best Actor award for any of them (the two exceptions are the old cop and the one who is a mobster's son, the one with the little kid from "The Godfather").   The one thing I like about this film, and one thing it does very well, is that it's based on a true story. A real movie. I loved the fact that the cop's sister- in-law (who was supposed to have died in a motorcycle accident and never was found) was actually a mob woman and had a husband who was the boss of a local gang of murderers. This really gave me a sense that the mafia had a hold on her and it's an interesting idea and one that makes for a very exciting plotline.  The music is the best part of the film. The original soundtrack is fantastic and this remake just adds some more to it. There are several songs from "Scarface", "Don't Shoot Me", "Bad Boys", "The Italian Job", "We Ain't Never Get Out Of Here Alive" and "You're A Wonderful Guy".   Some of the songs are played at a high volume, which may be too loud for some people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie begins with a montage of various scenes from the various episodes of   I  in which the crew of   The X-Files       is hunting and capturing aliens on behalf of the government,   while at the same time the FBI   does their part to investigate the case.   What follows is a fairly straightforward thriller that seems to follow the standard X-files formula, but it is actually a surprisingly good movie.  The story follows the same formula that has been done before, but unlike the previous movies it actually doesn't try to be funny.  There are a few funny bits, but they are not really funny. The actors don't seem to be as good as in the other X-men movies, but the movie itself is actually very good.  It is also refreshing to see an X-Men movie without the usual Marvel hero characters.  This movie is an exciting ride that should satisfy fans of the X-titles. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want a good action movie with a good story and good acting, then you should watch this movie. This movie is all about two fighters.

They start fighting and the guy that is strong is getting tired and the one that is really good is getting more tired.   The next day they are in the hospital with the guys that are going to fight for the title.  The movie ends with the two guys who is really heavy getting into a car and driving out of town.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I really felt like it wasn't an interesting movie. It had the same feeling of being a movie about nothing. But that was all it really was. And I didn't really mind it, not because I didn' t like the story, but I thought that the ending of this film was so cool that I don't know how it came to this. The ending of the movie was awesome! It was pretty well written. I felt like I really understood what it was all about. But at the same time, it just wasn't my cup of tea, it's like a mix between a movie and a drama. So if you're a fan of drama, then by all means, go see this movie. But if you like a good story and you want something that you don't really have in your life, then you should avoid this movie and read another review on it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So in my opinion this is one of those movies you can watch over and over again because it has a plot that just won't let you down.   From the first minute I knew that this was a movie I was going to see. I never have a problem with the plot so when it got rolling I was hooked.  One thing I really liked about this movie was that it had a lot of humor, especially in the beginning when the protagonist is trying to get the girl to talk about the real reason why he came to the town. The movie is about what the young man does with a girlfriend, which is a big difference from "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" where he gets her drunk and then rapes her.  Also in this movie the protagonist's mother is a pretty nice person.  Another thing I liked about "How To Lose a Girl in 10 days" was the ending.  I thought it was a real neat way to end a movie.  "How It Goes Around the World" is not nearly as good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked this movie. It was well-made and did not have a lot of unnecessary scenes. The ending scene with the big guy, and how he was done by the other cops is pretty funny as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story line was very interesting for me because I am not a big fan of "Borat" and I never was a big "Lazy Sunday" fan either. But I think if you like "Boris Karloff", "Baron Munchausen", "Dirty Harry", "Pulp Fiction" or other films about a man who is a clown who doesn't care if he is hated or loved, or just wants to go on a big adventure, this is a very fun movie to watch!   I can't say enough good things about this film. If you like comedy, slapstick, action and a lot of slapstick this is definitely for you!

This is a very unique film that I'm surprised isn't in more theaters.  A very interesting story with a wonderful cast.  The story of the man who wanted to be a prophet and the woman who was his love interest are so unique and well written.  I've always wanted to know what it was like to be on the other side.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a general rule of thumb, we're told that God is not a fan of this film:     "The people, the movie itself is great" - God "This movie should be shown in every school in the country!" - Mrs. Johnson "You have to give this a thumbs up, it is really a good time and one of the best films I've seen." - George H. Scherf "Good for the kids! Fun to watch too!" - Robert M. Stoller A must see movie for all ages - I thought I had seen everything but I was wrong.    This is a story about a group of boys who try to outdo each other with an elaborate prank.   There is some humor in this, but it has nothing to do with the story. The kids are all dressed up as animals and play a game of tag - only to run into something very special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen this movie since I was very little. I grew up on the TV series "Star Trek." It is a classic that I am a big fan of and that I love watching it. When I was a little girl, I would watch the original series and then come home and watch the animated series. I love the original "Star Fleet."   When I saw the new TV series, "Starfleet" I felt a big disconnect. I feel I am missing a part of the original. There was a whole lot of science fiction and action. That didn't seem to fit with the new series. When the series re-introduced it's old crew. It didn't feel like I was missing anything. So I watched this movie again and again.   A really great movie that I highly recommend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      This is a very simple story, that I think is a bit shallow to watch. I can't believe that after all these years this film has not been adapted into a big screen version, or at least a DVD. I have read and watched a few of the books in the Harry Potter series but I think this is a far better adaptation.   The story follows a boy named John Smith who grows up in the country in a small village called Wymondham. His father was a farmer, his mother was a widow and John's best friend was a boy called Percy. Percy has long brown hair and a funny looking grin that made John and Percy very close. One day John and his friend Percy come upon a boy in the woods who is holding a huge red book and he is the next Chosen One, or what John and many others believe.  John is very excited and curious about the boy's ability but Percy doesn't seem to know him that well and John keeps seeing strange things. One night Percy tries to read to John, which is never easy when you are a little boy, but somehow Percy doesn' t have an answer for John and John gets very tired of Percy's strange behavior. At one point Percy is killed by an ugly beast, a bogeyman which makes Percy mad and tries to kill John as well. The boy's mother thinks this is the way of life but Percy and John keep seeing strange and evil creatures in the forest all the time. John is a curious child but he is being abused and this is also what the villagers suspect but they do nothing about it. John and some other boys run away but Percy never sees him again. It becomes too hard for John to stay and Percy begins to hate the boy and his best friend who is called Percy, but John finds a way to turn the situation around.  It is a good story with a really strong and well written script.  I like the simplicity of it, it is hard to imagine a movie like this one.  A few of us in the audience were talking about it the whole movie and now we are wondering what is the best way to adapt it to a big-screen version?   I also enjoy the simplicity and lack of a lot of plot twists in the story.  In my opinion this is an excellent movie, it has great acting by the actors, good music, good scenes of a boy growing up in a rural village and all of a sudden the Boy

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Titanic" is, without a doubt, the worst movie ever made. I'd say it's even worse than "The Room" which is a horrible movie in a lot of ways. But it's a damn good movie, I think the only reason it's still here is because "Somewhere" has made it into an indie film, so the film may not be so bad. However, it's bad in every way, from story, acting, writing to direction. If a movie can't tell a story, it doesn't matter if it's well written or acted.   Now for the acting:  Michael Caine, a nice guy, was just a generic hero in this film. He's the one that sets off the first explosion, but he's just sort of like a person who could be in "Sommerset Place" or "The Godfather" and he never gets to be in anything interesting or even interesting enough to be called a good actor, let alone an interesting actor.

This is my first experience with a movie in which aliens from the planet Chupi-Chupi crash land on a planet called Earth.  It is up to us, a group of people on Earth, to find a way to stop the alien's from attacking our civilization.  My only problem with the movie was the sound of the movie. The movie made me realize that the movie "Mushroom" by Frank Zappa was made in the same studio (Sunway Studio) as the movie 'Mushrooms' by Michael and Richard. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "We're back!"   The return of a legendary show, featuring an amazing live audience, and some of the best songs of the 80s!   What an amazing show! The first set was incredible and this second set is even better! Jerry is a beast as always, and with an amazing solo to start off the show, we were off on a roll! The Truckin' is a treat, the jam has a little bit of space but the Dead never miss a beat! This show has all the classics and then some, the band is back to where they belong! Jerry does not waste a single note, and the band gets right into the mix. The Playing is as good as ever, they just keep coming back, and I was able to get through most of it! Jerry had a bit of a cold, but he was back for more in the second set, with a great He's Gone! What a treat! You know it's about to get good when Garcia's guitar solo is just mind blowing. The second set really did not have a lot of highlight but the Truckin, Scarlet, and Eyes are just fantastic, they really do a fantastic job of playing these classics. The Other One jam is just amazing, and Bobby's playing is amazing, he has to step out of his own mind to pull off this amazing vocal run. Jerry is playing a little crazy, but it all just works out! There is a little "touristy" element to the music, but the band keeps it cool, and Jerry brings out the best in everyone else. The band does not disappoint! What a show!

It was only through a series of coincidences that I finally found someone that did.   He was a fan of the Beatles for many years and had already written some songs about them.  I loved the movie.  There were some great Beatles songs and some very funny stories about the movie making.  The movie had some good action scenes but the music was great too.

The little girl, Elisa, is the only one in her small family who's never been to school. When her father's car falls into a river, Elissa is rescued by the woman from the nearby village who introduces her to the life of a child. Elisa has no other family. She has no friends. Her only friends are the people who come to her village from the village where she lives. It is at this stage that Elisa becomes aware that her village is not like the other villages. This is a country like a fairy tale. It's a country with a long tradition of witchcraft. There are good and evil spirits who inhabit the people, and they have to be avoided. The good spirits have the power of making someone happy in life, but the bad spirits can cause great unhappiness. When a boy, named Joe, falls in love with Elisa who is living in a hut under the tree, he wants to marry her. In the village, there are a group of witches who help Joe find a suitable wife for his future wife.   As the story develops, Eliza finds herself more and more in trouble. The bad spirits begin to do their worst to destroy her life and her love for Joe. It appears that the witches are using a man to find the right woman for Joe, but when the man meets Joe and he sees that she is all right, he decides to leave the place, and a horrible accident happens. This accident will take the life not only of Joe but of Elisa as well. As a last desperate attempt to save Elisa and her future, Joe decides to go back to the village with a small group of friends. On his return journey, Joe meets a beautiful woman and they fall in love. Joe realizes that he has to marry Elisa before the witches destroy everything in the village.  However, this is not as easy as it seems. Eliza's father, a priest, is a powerful witch, and so is the evil witch, a woman named Vashti. The woman is jealous of Eliza and doesn't want Joe to marry his daughter. Joe does not have the strength to fight Vashshi, and when he tries to escape the village to save her, Elise is killed by Joe's car and he is badly hurt. After Joe recovers, he goes to a friend's

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many of you, I enjoyed "Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith".   This movie is, as is expected, full of humor, adventure, and an old-fashioned action-adventure-adventuring adventure plot.   The film is directed by Peter Jackson and written by Kathleen Kennedy and David S. Goyer.  Star Wars: The Original Trilogy is a complete trilogy about Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (the bad guys), a group of bounty hunters, and a mysterious character named Anakin Skywalker (the good guys) in the future.  The story features many familiar elements from Star Wars, such as Luke and Vader trying to save their friends.  Luke is not very good at being a Jedi and is forced to kill a child during his training.  Vader is trying to protect his son from the Empire, while the bounty hunters are trying to make the Empire pay.  Although the bounty hunter characters are interesting, I found them to be too much of a distraction from the action scenes.  In contrast, the two heroes, Luke and Darth, are very powerful and must be protected against the Empire.  Unfortunately, these characters are not good enough to save the planet.  With all these action sequences, the movie becomes very tiring.  However, the film is well-paced and the suspense is still very good.  I had a good time watching this movie, although I felt that there was no real ending.  For people who want to see a good Star Wars film, you should check this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would say "Good Bye Mr. Black" is the definition of a great comedy. The premise is great. You have a black man who comes home from prison and decides to become a policeman. The first half of the film is great but by the end of the movie it gets a little boring. There is too much going on and I don't know if the black guy would be a better cop or not. The only thing good about this movie is it is a funny movie and you don't see any racial hatred in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a fan of the old, old James Bond movies from the past, and I was hoping that the latest movie was going to be one of my favorite. Well, this movie does not disappoint! I do not know if this movie would be a great James Bond movie if I did not have to add that it is a bad movie. I will leave the bad out of this review so that I could say that this movie is a boring movie. Well you know what they say about a boring James Bond.   The plot: We have to go into the jungle and find the source of a deadly and unstoppable poison which is killing people. We have some awesome sequences in the jungle. One sequence in which the jungle is burning was very nice.  It is a good sequence and it had a great ending. The plot, however, is nothing special and there is a lot of stuff that is going to confuse you. It is all kind of confusing, although the movie is not too bad, but it is just not an enjoyable movie.  I really wanted to like this movie. It had a good plot, but the bad is just too bad. The whole movie was just boring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can't talk about a movie like the above without at least mentioning the film's star and sole main character.  That's right, there are no other characters to speak of, there's just a lot of people talking, a lot more than the movie's plot is likely to allow (or be comfortable with) and, on top of that, we've got a very, very heavy and, for lack of a better word,  pissant plot that seems to come straight from an eighties action film of the same name (or, more likely, from a film from the early eighties).  It all adds up to being a movie about the end of the world, a movie that's very little more than a cheap exercise in trying to come up with something about the Apocalypse.   It's the kind of movie you watch if you want to go on a ride down memory lane.  I won't lie to you -   I enjoyed the hell out of it.  But the thing is,   it doesn't really want to be.  And that's probably where it goes wrong.  The movie starts off strong, but the characters just can't make it work, not without a lot further development.  The main character is a very well developed character, but then the story doesn't allow him to grow and grow and that's when the movie starts to get really messy.  It tries too hard to create a character that's likable,  and at some point it just starts to feel like it's trying too hard.  When it's not being too dramatic, there is plenty to enjoy here:  it's a very fast paced movie and it's often very fast to catch your breath.  There's a few characters that are a little too 'cartoony', and others that don't quite know what the hell they're doing, but it never really gets old and that makes it a worthwhile watch.  At the end, however,  it just gets tiresome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the perfect mix of comedy and suspense: a combination that is hard to come by these days. I just wanted to watch a comedy about a group of people trapped on a ship for a hundred years. It works well because it's funny and it's exciting. It's just like a movie about a bunch of people stuck on a train, except this time, a ship that's the size of a skyscraper.   When the captain gets a new girlfriend (well, we didn't really know that the captain's had a girlfriend) he gets the crew to buy her a ticket to the other side of the ship. And so that's where we are now, two hundred years in the future. The captain's wife has been killed, and she doesn't even care. And the ship is stuck on the ocean and the crew is just trying to get off.  Posted by D.A. Pennington at 6:23 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this was a pretty fun movie to watch.   The story follows the journey of a group of travelers, who go to a different country in order to fulfill a dream of theirs, with the help of the local "King" (not really a King, but he was kind of the big bad guy in this movie).   They eventually end up in a small town where a local (an eccentric old man), who is a very powerful wizard and is quite the charmer, is also the King of the country.  The magic he shows them is amazing, and we get to watch them fall in love with him and be forced to fight and protect him from those who would try and take him away.  There were a lot of laughs throughout the movie, and the animation was also very good, but I didn't really like the voice acting.  So we finally have an actual King in this film! I'll admit that I loved the king (for a while at least), so there's a good chance I won't be mad at the poor performances. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason I can say this movie is good is because it's so different from most movies I've seen.   It's just a short story of the death of a boy in a park when a girl who looks like a cat comes and is the last person to see him, and is later found to be the boy's killer and is caught by the police. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. I never thought I would see a movie that was about a mother and her two sons.   They are so different in personality and attitude.  They don't know the right way to do anything.  I found the humor very good.  This movie was a very good use of the children's play style to add a little depth to a film about a mom and two kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As the title suggests, the story is told from a woman's point of view, but the way this is done is so interesting and creative that it just works. I also like the way they play with the fact that there are two of them - one an older woman, and the other an infant - the woman who has an amazing sense of humor, and I do feel sorry for her when the baby gets sick.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a very entertaining film, but a little repetitive.   The movie is set in a small village in the south east of France and the whole thing is set on a beach, complete with beautiful women playing on the beach and playing on their fancy beach toys.  It starts with the main characters, and we have a little boy (Bruno) and a little girl (Anja), who have some difficulty communicating with each other.  When this is not enough to get their minds together, they decide to take a road trip to visit their grandmother and meet some friends from home.  But they end up being in the middle of a big storm, where they find out that the town of Beauvais is a few miles away and they have to get there by boat.  The storm is very interesting and the plot is a little predictable in that it always goes back to the beach.  I really enjoyed it!   - Rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw a movie called "My Wife's Boyfriend" a couple of days ago and it was a funny little comedy with a good cast and a good director, and I think if you have a good time with this one, you can probably enjoy any film you put it with.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's nothing like it.   The music is always great and the director is one of the top directors in the business.  You can get to grips with the film by watching the trailers, but to really enjoy this film you need to sit down and watch it with your eyes for a long time.  I was pretty much lost when I saw it for the first time, and as a result I wasn't able to fully understand the plot or the film.  When I sat down and watched it again the plot really began to make sense, but it was still hard to get fully into.  As for the film, it's fantastic, but I'm still not sure if I'll have time to watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I had seen this movie at a later date, I would have been a lot more disappointed in the ending. It is the typical action movie clichés that Hollywood has perfected in the 80s (the title "Star Trek" has been around since the 60s - they just have never done justice to it - and the cast is a mix of actors who are usually good for a bad movie). The cast is fairly good - the young Spock is a little annoying, but there are more capable ones in the cast. The film follows an ancient alien space probe as it travels through space to its destination. In doing so, it encounters a small planet of humans with a lot of trouble with the native inhabitants, including an evil witch. These humans, called "the Klingons", are also trying to leave Earth to seek a new home (in a galaxy far away), but the probe does not believe in that path and tries to warn them of the consequences of their departure. The Klingons then make it clear to the probe that if they do not follow their advice, they will not leave earth alive. The probe tries to tell the Klingons that they have no chance of a peaceful landing in a distant place, but their way of life is so alien that their views are completely alien - which is exactly what is needed to bring them in line. However, they insist that the probe not take on their people and try to destroy the probe and its human crew. However the probe has an escape pod (a craft with a small shuttle-pod on the top that allows for a quicker escape from the Klingon planet, if only one takes a moment to use the shuttle-pods) and one of the crewmen (the one with the blue skin - the one the probe tells to ignore his people - he is the one who decides to go) takes the pod. This crewman's actions result in a chain reaction that sets the Klingoning people into a self-destruct mode. As the probe is going to be destroyed, a mysterious energy source called "The Transporter" is put on the planet and the entire population of the planet is brought into the future (to a galaxy beyond our own). Now the Klingonese people have nothing to do with the future. Their lives are meaningless and, because the probe doesn't believe in a peaceful future, there is no way that they could find a new place for themselves in this new world. Now the human-Klingon alliance (
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Good Son is a decent enough film. It is quite entertaining, but sadly it falls short of its inspiration. As much as I like the idea, it is a film without the heart. There is no real feeling of remorse, nor the slightest sense of caring for the characters. This may be true to the reality of the situation, but that is not what is needed. There seems to be no real insight into why this particular person became the way he is, or what his future will be. It's like a kid's film, or a fantasy about the future. It may be entertaining, and a bit silly, but it lacks anything resembling real human feeling. "   - From a review on Movieguide.com   A fun movie! Very original and well done   I have never been into horror movies but this was one of the best movies I have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is fantastic, the characters are great and the animation is great, especially the fight scenes (even if the effects look a bit cheap, it still looks great and I love the fights).   In a very bad way, the movie ends in a cliffhanger that could have been a nice conclusion (for the whole story) and it also sets up the next movie in a very similar style.   I was hoping for more of this story, because the first half was good and I enjoyed it and the second half, which I enjoyed even more was very, very, close to the first, but in a bad way.

The fact that I don't know about other critics, just about all I know about it is that it's a great little thriller, full of suspense, mystery, and murder.

The film was directed by John Krasinski and written by his wife.

I saw it at a movie theater near Chicago and had no idea that it was about a little girl. The only thing I did think was that the little girl had a "dancing" disease. There were a lot of scenes that really stuck with me. But I do believe this is a children's movie. There is just not a lot to see for me in it. The characters are a lot like your little girl or a doll. I think this was a little too long for a childrens' movie. I'd be interested to see how many times they can show this girl with a dance.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with a flashback to the late 1950s in the small town of North Star, TX. (We've seen a few other "lost Texas" movies.) There is a group of college kids in a cabin on a lake, playing a game of "Hide-and-Seek" for what they believe to be the best prize in the world: the treasure of a sunken pirate ship. There's an incident where the treasure is taken, which has to be recovered. After retrieving the treasure and discovering some of the treasure's secrets, a band of pirates, led by Captain Hook and Captain Redbeard, arrive to claim the treasure. The film was so popular and the cast, led mainly by Cary Grant and Richard Crenna, is really terrific. I've seen them many times and this is another great film. It's funny, it's action packed and it's a good old-fashioned story about pirates, treasure and old-world adventure. I really like this film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie. I had a couple problems with it that made it a good but not great movie. The first problem is the plot. It is a typical action movie, one where all the bad guys are all bad and it seems that the bad guy is always the baddest one there, but then you find out that the good guys are actually worse then the badguy. There was one case where the badguys and the goodguys fought side by side but then there was a bad guy that saved the day and I don't like that because that is just dumb. Another problem with the plot is that it was too long. The movie only covered 10% of the movie and it was about an hour long and that is really long for a movie about a battle between good and evil. The ending was pretty good and I liked the fight with the badman but then again I liked it better than the movie that came before it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very good. A good story about a little boy named Ben and his uncle who is a vampire. But also, about a girl named Beth, who is his best friend and love of his life. This movie was made in 1962 by a young director named Robert Mulligan. I do recommend this movie to all people who have a good imagination and a good heart. This is one of the best movies ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is a very good film. It was made in 1979, but the film still holds up to this day, so it's not a movie made to appeal to the modern audience. It is based on a true story, where the plot is basically just what you would expect from a movie about Chinese martial artists fighting against the Japanese Army. It stars Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and was directed by a man by the name of David Yost. It's about a group of Chinese men who are training to become Chinese ninjas in order to take revenge against the corrupt Japanese government. The film is so fast-paced, and it's so great because it actually keeps the viewer guessing about who will win every fight and even more so when the Chinese characters suddenly change into different characters. This also makes it very realistic, as each character's personality is very believable. "Crazy Rich Asians" is very similar in many ways to "Curious George" and the whole film is very entertaining. It may not be as fast-moving and as exciting as the other two films, but it's a fun watch and one that everyone should give a try.

When you see the original, you don't know how to take it.  If you're a kid and it was your first time watching something, then you don`t know if this is a good idea or not.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did not expect much from this movie, as a first impression of it was quite good and it was good to see a few new blood at the helm. It had some great fight scenes and the story was pretty good. The cinematography in the movie was a bit dated and it is a bit of a slow film, but it still holds its own, and I like to see those old movies in a good way.   This movie may not have much to offer now, but as a film from 1991 and the fact that it was remade in 2010 and is much better than before I would say it is worthy to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been in love with a man for some time now, and for many years I've been trying to persuade him to have sex with me. I've even offered to buy him a car if he would have sex, but he just laughs and tells me I'm no good. Well I'm a complete idiot and now he's telling me to come here for a tryst.   The film starts out quite normal enough, with the man and the girl chatting, and at the end of the first scene they get to talking about their past.  She's an artist. The man's a writer. The movie is like a collection of their day in the life, so as not to bore the audience too much with what they say at the beginning.  I was expecting some more realistic sex, with lots of moaning and groaning, a little bit of bondage, but instead we get a lot of just sitting down and talking.  At the beginning, we see them in bed and the woman is obviously very turned on. She has to keep telling the man that he's too shy and she's not going to do it.  But once he's had sex with another woman, he just can't get over it. The woman wants more and he's embarrassed about it. He wants sex with a normal guy, but it won't happen. It's like a man and woman who want to be a normal couple.  There is quite a lot in this movie. The relationship is very realistic. It doesn't happen every day and it takes a little time to get to know each other. There are a few funny scenes too. And it's easy to see that these are two different people. Both have good sex. In fact, it's quite obvious they have a good sex life.  The only bad thing about this movie is the ending.  A lot of people will have trouble getting through it. I think it's too much sex for one film. Maybe that's what we need to see more of, but we also don't need a lot more. If you're looking for something a little more realistic, this is the right movie to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most charming films I've seen all year!   It's a very fun little film with a delightful cast of characters, especially the titular character, a young woman living in a very remote house, a bit like a Swiss watch in a cottage.   Unfortunately, that Swiss watch can't be hidden when it wants to.  The plot is based on an old Italian fairytale, in which a princess and a peasant, each of them a bit foolish, get into an argument with the prince (who has a sword and shield) because the girl will never marry a peasant.  She finally does, and he then lets her go.  Then, all of a sudden, the peasant girl is caught up in an evil witch's magic.  You've seen it before; the girl is a little girl.  But here, the witch is very much evil. And the princess is a princess, who is a bit older than the peasant. The young witch wants to use the little princess as a bride, to marry the peasant's son, and to make the girl love her own family.  They don't get any more help from the witch than they do from the evil witch.  It is a fun little fairytales of a peasant girl trying to escape from the princess's magic and get home.  A little fairy tale, no doubt, but a lot of fun to watch.

I can only compare this movie to The Wicker Man.    I would go as far as to say it is even worse than that one.  In fact I would even go so far as saying it is completely worthless.  It has a very interesting plot line but it has zero meaning to it, and no real purpose.  And I am going to add that I think this movie is just for kids and the audience to watch.  For all the kids watching this movie it should be fun and entertaining. But for an adult it is simply a waste of time and money.  I have never seen a movie more pointless, boring and pointless than this.  So please if you have not seen this movie you may want to stay away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   I was very excited to see a movie that would be made in Toronto and would be set at a university. It was the first time I had seen a movie about a university with no English and I didn't like it. But it was a movie with a good storyline that I liked very much.   The plot involves an evil genius whose plot of having a class with a small group of girls he has trained to be perfect so they would have him as their teacher, was never to be. His students wanted a lot from him, they did what he taught them to do and they got good grades and he became a rich man with an amazing car. He has a very evil and nasty character and his henchman is a little boy who would do anything he asked him to do.  This is a short film and you can get a lot of enjoyment from watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A new kind of comedy film for adults made in 2002.    The premise is similar to a couple of movies I saw, a young woman gets a promotion at her job, then a friend of hers is fired from the company, and his family is thrown into the chaos.  It's a very funny film and the humor doesn't go off the rails until a very surprising ending, but it's still a nice comedy with a pretty good soundtrack.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   I was so happy to be able to see a great movie about a great guy, a brilliant engineer and a brilliant scientist. I had no idea that there was so much more to him than I thought.   This film is like a cross between a good film about a man, The Wizard of Oz and a good play about a magician.  My wife and I, who don't watch much old school science fiction movies or plays, really enjoyed this one.  For those who have seen The Wizard, this will be a treat to watch. I enjoyed it a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was skeptical about this movie since it has the words "love story" in the title. I was also wary of the fact that this movie is about a high school girl who had been molested. However, I have to say that this film is one that I loved to see. It is not your standard high school movie. It focuses on different aspects of teenage life such as romance, friendships, the school environment, relationships, the importance of community and self-esteem. It does this in such a way that it does not really focus on the main character and the molestation but rather shows her growing up with her new school friends. It all comes to a conclusion by the end of the film when the high school age girl realizes she is not alone in the world. I found this film to be a real breath of fresh air and one I will definitely be watching again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember watching the first movie. I thought it was a pretty cool idea, I liked the characters and the ending was cool. The plot, however, didn't live up to the concept. The whole movie was about a group of people who were supposed to kill a man who was supposedly the "Antichrist." The movie seemed very silly, and the actors never really did anything that I didn't think was kind of a stupid idea. I was just waiting for the next movie, but now that I've watched the first one I can see why the movie didn't work.

The main characters are interesting and the storyline is not completely bad, I just wish it was less over the top.

I was really worried this time that the movie would be boring or a bit boring and I was not disappointed in the least. It has some good characters and the characters really grow along with the characters. The story is really good and it's a good film. It's the characters that make it, it's the things they do not do or the things that they get up to that makes this one stand out. I just hope that this one doesn't get a sequel because it's great but I am pretty sure that the director of this movie will make a sequel and the same thing that was said about this film will be said about that sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie, I knew right from the first scene that I was going to like it. It's a comedy about a family who can't decide on their son's name. They all agree that his first name should be "Eddie," but his sister doesn't think so, so he goes by the name "Johnny." Eddie gets a job at an ice cream parlor, but it's the worst job he has ever had, and the owners don't like him. They call him "Johnny" but it just sounds funny to them. After they can't get rid of him, they fire him. Johnny is so unhappy he goes up to the owner of the shop and says, "Do you remember me?" "Yeah, Johnny. Well, if you're still hungry, you can always come back next week for a milkshake." Eddie decides he has had enough of it. He drives down to the ice cream shop, and says "I'm Johnny" and gets a milky drink. Johnny doesn't seem to mind though and gets another drink as well. After a while, the owner asks Eddie if he is ready to move on, and Johnny just smiles and says something like "I can't think of anything. I'd like to think I could, but I can't. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting." That's the end of the story, I think. I like the ending, and I like that the "Johnny's" mother was a real character. I wish there was a sequel, because I don't know if I'd really want to see what happened to Johnny, but maybe they'll make a third movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never expected that the first three-quarters of the film were going to be so good; I think they were written by a couple of kids.   They were a little slow at first (because the story had to be told, and the plot, if it is one, is complicated, and a little obvious) but they soon got going, and began to tell the story of a man who tries to find his son, who has gone missing while on a job, with the help of a woman named Ethel.    They spend the day, which is in the summertime, looking for clues, and things go horribly wrong; the husband and son go missing, and Ethel tries to piece together what happened.  This is a movie that has an excellent cast and a great story to tell. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      There are some issues with the film that will leave you scratching your head. But they're minor, and are hardly worth mentioning.   The movie begins on a positive note, with two children riding bikes across an open field while being watched by a passing boy.  The boy takes the boys on a nice hike to a nearby waterfall, which the boys enjoy.  But this is just the beginning of a more bizarre ride.  As the boys get further from the waterfall, things start to go wrong.  One boy, a bright-eyed and wide-eyed 11-year-old, has no idea what to do, and he is quickly overwhelmed by his fear and fear is contagious.  It is at this point that we see the world through a distorted lens, with some strange creatures lurking about in the shadows.  And this is where the trouble really begins.  There is a group of strange creatures in the woods.  Some of them look like children from a different century, and others look like they come out of a sci-fi movie.  I don't know what it is about these things, but they do what they do very effectively, and it's not pretty.  While the boys are out wandering the woods, they find a small house that appears to be abandoned, but there's no reason to be suspicious.  When the boys enter the house, they are shocked by what they find.  This house has a woman in it!  The woman is very young, and looks like the mother of a small child.  Her name is Alice.  Alice is being held prisoner by her mother, and she begs the boys to free her.  Luckily, they can't resist, and they do just that.     She does not seem to be doing a very good job of it, though.  She is trapped, and cannot move.  After much pleading and pleading, the boys manage to break the door to her cell.  In the process, they stumble on the mysterious monsters, and the film ends with them both being captured by them.  They are all very nice to the boys, and all appear to be very happy to have them back.  We are meant to think that the creatures are a happy family, but a little too happy to be true.  Then things get a little weird.  What's happening is this.  First, we see a strange creature, a large, glowing orange shape, looking

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I like a movie about a kid and the kids in his class that are all just like him. He just hangs out with them and makes friends with them. He has good friends in the group and he gets them in trouble. But they are still friends after school, so no harm, no foul. A kid who has made it to his 18th birthday can not seem to find work, and has turned to a life of crime. His best friend, a girl who calls him her "Little Beaver" has her own problems. In a twist worthy of a '50s movie, a former classmate turns up dead, having apparently committed suicide. He does not go over well with his classmates, who don't understand his reason for killing himself. This is a teen movie to remember, a good one."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first and only movie I ever watched with my father. It was when I was 4 years old. It is about a boy who has an imaginary friend, called a "Rabbit". The Rabbit was a very clever and evil character. At one point when the Rabbit was about to get killed, the Rabbit asked the boy to help him to escape. The boy was only told what to do by the Rabbit. This is where my father got a little jealous. The Rabbit did not like that my father was looking at him all the time, especially with his shirt off. So the Rabbit tried to kill my father with a meat cleaver. The movie ends when the rabbit ran away and the boy and the rabbit are left together in the woods. My father was not happy, but my mother always told me not to cry and laugh too much. I am an adult now and I never watched that movie again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that this film is a masterpiece, a masterpiece that can bring back a thousand memories of my college years. This film has a very dark plot, that is the one thing about it that kept me from enjoying it as much as I did. When I watched the trailers for this film, I noticed a few references to the book, and I thought that it looked a little like the movie, until I read the book. It is very dark and full of some very dark scenes. The character acting was top notch as well. I can't give this film a 9 out of 10. I would give it a 10, but I am being generous.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:       The story begins with a group of friends who play games of hide-and-seek. Their friend, a girl named Shiro, is an expert at hiding and the boys are determined to get her. They set up a little game called hide-n-go-dive, and the others begin to learn how to hide, move about the room, and sneak around. There are puzzles and clues to be found, and once they have done that, they find the body of Shiro's former teacher, Professor Pest. She was a very interesting character and has many different side-stories in her own right. And of course, there is a big murder that leads to the discovery of Professor Puske, the creator of the hide-dives.   Although it doesn't really have an end (although there is the mystery of who murdered Shiro), Hide-n go-doom is very enjoyable.  The characters are varied, some are very funny, while others aren't. There is the obligatory "chocolate murder" with Professor Puzke and his chocolate. But you know, the chocolate is a lot more interesting than the actual murder.  A very cool movie about hiding and being sneaky.

There were a lot of things that didn't work in my opinion (like the "I am the captain!" bit) but I suppose that is because I was too young to appreciate some of it. I think the "Tonger" part is great, though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The only reason I'd bother to write a negative review is that I wish the story had more time to develop; it doesn't. But it doesn 't have to, or even need to, as the action is entertaining, the characters well-written, and there are a few laughs.   The film itself isn't very good; it's a pretty good first attempt at a remake that's trying to pull something a little more interesting out of the same old formula (the first movie had more of an action-adventure feel, the second movie had a more of a psychological horror vibe).   I would've rather seen it take a little longer to develop and a little less of a formulaic feel, but hey, that's just me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a couple of scenes which should not be overlooked when we talk about the art of filmmaking.   One of these scenes is the scene when the two men are trying to escape through the back of a car.  The camera pulls away to show the view of the car. The camera is moving forward, while the two boys are in a tiny room of a trailer.  What a great place to hide and run from the authorities.  After the two escape the car, the camera pulls back to reveal the scene from the other side.  As the camera is pulled back to the first side of the trailer, we see a very dark background and the two kids. The light from the window makes them appear to be a couple.  A small room in the back has a desk, a lamp and a black book.  This is the moment when I saw the movie.  When I looked over to my right, I saw that the black book on the desk had a black hole in the middle.  Now, we have seen many movies in my life, and it is only because of these two scenes that I decided to watch this movie. I must admit I had not seen a movie with a girl in it in a long time.  One night, when I came home from school and saw it on the screen, I realized that the boy and the girl were one and the same.  I thought that this was a really good movie. A great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those that don't know, the movie is a tribute to  The Twilight Zone  the TV series. It takes place in the year 2030 and it follows the life of a man named Walter Bishop (Cameron Diaz) and his friend Sam (Nick Sandow) as they experience different aspects of life in the future. They try to make money and make friends and even get a job at a gas station.   This was a great movie to watch and it had a lot of good ideas and it gave you a lot to think about. I especially liked the part where the father who was the main character from the TV show visits the future with his daughter to see what has happened to him and he is so disappointed. He sees his son in prison and the son doesn't seem to be doing well.  In the beginning of the movie Walter goes to the bar with Sam to see if he can meet some friends from the future but Walter is not there so Sam goes home.  It's not long after that Sam starts having nightmares about his son being in prison.  At this point he goes to see his doctor and he tells Sam that he was raped.  Sam is not a big fan of the doctor so he goes out and finds a prostitute who tells him that he can talk to Walter but he has to go back to the future to get some help for his son.  Unfortunately he can't and this leads to Sam going back to his house to talk to the priest who knows how to help Walter.  When Sam finds out that his father was the rapist he tells Walter to find a new partner and he doesn't see that Walter is able to do that.  This leads to a scene that is like a cross between a comedy and a horror movie.  Walter and Sam go to the doctor and get some medication to try to bring Walter's condition back but the medication doesn't work. Sam has to do his own treatment because the doctor doesn't have the right medicine.  The doctor is a bit of a dick about it so he leaves so Walter and he go to a diner for a meal and they talk a bit. Walter starts talking about all the things he has experienced since he was a child and Sam tells Walter that he has problems with his mind as well. That leads to Walter asking him how his mind works and then he begins to ask Sam a lot about his personal life.  Things go down hill and Sam thinks he is going insane but

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (This review is a bit of a misnomer - the film is about what happens when you take a bunch of kids who love to play in the sand, and mix them with a bunch more who want to get rich. Yes, I am being sarcastic here. However, there's so much to like about this film! First of all, it's all the way funny - no, it really is. From the opening, you are told that it's about a boy named Dwayne (Ben Johnson) who lives with his dog in a desert, who dreams of becoming a writer. (Not a bad dream, I guess, just not a very realistic one...) When his friend is killed by a bad guy named Max (Tatum O'Neal), Dwayne is forced to go into hiding. (Well, not really. He has to steal the money of the dead friend's dad to pay for his living expenses.) The film's best moments are when the young actors try to be their real selves. Their attempts are not always successful, but they are funny. As Dwayne himself says at one point, "We're all just kids playing in the desert. No big deal. This is just life." (Note that this is also one of the few times in the film that the film actually gets dark.) I enjoyed seeing old Hollywood actors such as O' Neal (as Max's goon) and Robert Blake (as the Sand Kid) try out their old-timey voices. The real star of the film, however, is the young Ben Johnson as Dwayne. The kid's attitude is so endearing that you can't help but like him - it's almost like a character out of a children's cartoon! (I also enjoyed watching Dwayne's younger brother, who has a small part in the movie, as the Sandkid - just think of it as a small "B" picture. It's like a Disney character.) Even though I'm not a huge movie buff, I was still surprised by some of the moments in the first act. For instance, the scene at the sandpit when Dwayne finally finds a piece of the girl's sand castle is one of my favorite scenes in a childrens film. I was very surprised, too, by a small scene in the bathroom - it gave me a good laugh! A great film to watch at the beach, or at the park with friends!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only complaint I have about this movie is that the film's ending didn't quite make sense, I mean, it's one thing to show you the final part of a movie when your a kid, then let you get out of the way and then get hit by a car, it was cool, and it was something different from all the other kids movies out there. Well, I never felt like I should get hit or even feel bad that I was not as cool as the other heroes of the movie, but they seemed to be much cooler than me and I thought that was a little much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, that's a good film! The film is set in a dystopian future, and a big part of that is that they don't have anything in the cities or suburbs, and all the buildings are big and ugly, the streets are full of trash, all the people are ugly, all of their faces are ugly. And the cities are pretty much the same, big, ugly, smelly. There is a woman named Marissa (Sylvia) who runs a book and a movie theater, and there is this girl named Anna (Julianne Moore) who is a big fan of her. Anna wants to know about Marissa and she is always asking questions, but she doesn't really get any answers. So one day Anna goes to Marissa's theater, it is the most disgusting and disgusting movie theater that you can imagine, but Marissa lets her go in, and the movie starts! It is about a woman that finds herself pregnant, and this pregnancy has some horrible effects on her and her baby. The mother that is supposed to be there to help is a terrible person, she uses every evil move she can think of to try to get rid of the baby. And then the guy that Marissa is having an affair with has a thing with a young actress, and he is trying to get Anna to marry the young actress. And it turns out that this whole thing is not a dream or a dreamy dream, it's a very horrible reality. But the good part is that Anna is able to defeat this horrible person, and after Anna's baby is born she gives the baby to Marisa and she and Marissa begin a relationship, and it is a very good friendship, and they get along well. The only negative thing I could think of was that Marisa is always talking about how ugly and disgusting her life is, and she does it in a way that makes you think of her as being evil. But she also does love Anna and has some good morals, so you can't hate her.

She marries his uncle, whose family was rich, who turns out to be a bad guy, so she runs away from her uncle and her mother and ends up in a convent.   And she works there for a few years and there is one night she is alone in the convent, and she gets a good cry and she starts thinking about the fact that she should be a nun because she has a good job and all the other nuns are nice to her.

The mom says it's not possible but she will see if she can talk to the doctor about it, who is an old school friend of hers and he tells her that she can find a new husband at any age, but if she does, she is not going to get more money or better jobs.  So she decides to keep her job, but she is still sad about her future. She has a new idea, that the church wants to find a young girl to be the successor of St. Peter and he asks her to get married and then he can have a lot of money.  And when she says this to her mother, she sees that she is really not going along with her plan. She tells her mother about the plan, and mom starts crying, because she's afraid of the future.  Then she says to her son, "Son, you're so stupid, you don't realize how bad this is, because you can't believe a girl like you will get married to an actor and you won't get any more money. So you should be careful, don't marry the actor, he will marry you."   Now mom wants to change her mind, she

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a great time with this movie. I was expecting a lot of violence and maybe it did happen a bit but it was just the right amount of violence for me. It was also fun to see them go out for a nice meal at the beach.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a nice little story about a girl who travels to a fantasy land. This film is good because it has a good sense of humor. This isn't a "dumb" film by any means, but it is a pretty good one with a pretty decent plot. This is for me one of those films that are good enough to watch after a long day at work or something. I think it would work better for a family audience. It is nice for people to be able to get a fantasy story without being scared at the beginning. I liked the romance aspect of it.   Rating: 8.4 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well this is a film about a person who has a horrible life, but who is still able to make friends through the world of games. He gets bullied, but when he gets invited to play some games he does pretty well and gets accepted. One of the games is the most boring game in the world, but he still makes new friends and his life changes forever. He learns that this life can be amazing if he just puts his mind to it, but it will be a long road.   I enjoyed this film, and I'm glad I watched it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't want to go to this movie but I had to because it was too good to pass up. I am really happy I decided to go and see it, it was good! I liked the idea of an ex-con who wanted to be a hero by helping people, so I thought the movie was really well done. The actors were so funny and you could feel the love that was on the characters' part. The movie got a 10 and I loved it! I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be good to have a movie with this kind of theme, and it actually made a good theme because this movie was very dark, it took place in the ghetto, and was a great character study.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did not expect much from this movie, but i have to say that this is a good flick and a good action movie. The movie starts out with the main character, a hero who takes on some big companies and does not let them take him down. He starts to run out of money so he does some robbery to get some. But what happens next. His buddy starts to get killed and he then tries to get revenge. But then the other main characters also gets killed and they try to stop him. The good thing about this movie is the characters in this movie. It has some funny moments and also some serious scenes and i am a fan of the characters. The fight scenes were great and the movie has a good ending.    Recommend for people who want a good watch and some good action movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is no better way to describe this movie than by saying that it's a good, bad, and ugly film.    A good movie   would be a movie that made you laugh, cry, feel emotions, and wonder about life.  This movie, on the other hand, is not funny, it is sad.  As a result, it makes no sense.  One could argue that this film is about a woman who loses her baby after she accidentally drops it in a swimming pool.  She is devastated by her loss and attempts to cope by going to the park where the kids are.  That is not where it ends.  The kids play with a toy car and are playing a game of hide and seek with a ball.  Suddenly, the car crashes into a tree.  Not only is this an accident but a child dies in the accident.  Even though she feels guilty for causing the accident, she does not try to help the child.  Instead, she sits back, and looks at her sad life with no reason for any of her decisions.  In one of the most disturbing sequences in the film, the mom sits alone, staring at a photo album.  With a horrible smile, she says, "I've been through a lot.  I'm trying to take care of you now."   The woman in the photo album is not the woman who took care of the kid.  It's her husband.  He is the one who hit her in the pool.   And it's because he hit her that her baby was in danger.  But it's not the fact that she killed her baby that makes her feel guilty.  No.  To her, the fact of losing her baby is the only reason for her actions.  Because she killed the baby was all that mattered to her.  And that is why she did what she did.  There is no good reason to kill a child.   There is nothing to be gained from killing a child, and there is no reason to help a child who has been killed.  If I may be so bold, this movie makes the claim that a child is a treasure that should never be destroyed.  After all, if a child were destroyed, there would be no reason left to have a life.   That is why the parents choose to hide the boy from the world, and leave the little girl to her fate.  Yet, the baby has become
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "What if the most beautiful and romantic place in the world is actually a terrible place?"   When I saw this movie, I was thinking, "How do we make an erotic movie without making it cheesy?"  It took me until the end of the movie to realize that the story was not about romance, but about survival.   The film shows a world where a woman named Lisa is pregnant with a beautiful child, but her husband has taken her and her baby and is planning on killing her.  Lisa's husband, Dr. Manton, is an excellent physician and knows that she has a gift. He knows that they will not be able to live in this beautiful place if she is killed.  While he tries to explain to the police that his wife will be killed, Lisa is seen by her husband while he is having sex with her. He pulls her hair and tells her he loves her. His wife is then seen holding her own baby in her arms, and she tells him he has to give the baby to her. She says, "I don't want this baby. My baby doesn't want you."   And, of course, her baby doesn�t want her either.  Manton thinks Lisa has a terrible disease, and tries to convince her to go back into the wilderness, and he tries very hard to get her back.  As he is trying to convince Lisa to return to the wilderness to continue with the birth of her child, she tells Manton she wants her child to be raised in the city and wants to live with her mother in the suburbs.  She tells him she wants to make her own choices and she can choose to live out her life as a housewife in the suburb. Maval�s response is, "So, what about your child? I have a child, too, but I do not want to live like you do."  But she tells us she doesn�'t want to have children either. Her husband tells her she is going to give birth to a "beautiful, perfect, perfect child." But he asks her to have an abortion.  Her husband, Manton tells her, is going after a doctor that will be able save her, but that doctor has been killed by a terrorist. He is going off to the city to meet the surgeon.  "It�s time," Manton says. "We are going to go, now. We are going now."  Maval
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this is the first thing that ever came out. I found this film rather boring, like so many of the 'action' films that you see on television. I really have no idea what they were going for with this one. I can't even see any of the action, and the special effects are laughable. You see, this movie's 'action', consists of lots of people walking along a desert road. It just kind of looks like everyone is walking around a desert at night, except for the people on the vehicles. There's lots of 'pop' sounds of people talking and shouting things to each other, which just don't sound like they are actually being said. Just kind of goes along with the film and the general atmosphere it creates. This is just a film about a guy going off to the desert with some buddies to 'find out who he is'. I can only imagine what kind of stuff he could have gotten up to out there, with the'super natural' creatures they are encountering.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie reminded me of what a great movie should be like.   The movie takes place in the 60's in the United States.  When the film starts the main character (played by a little boy) gets lost and ends up at a movie theater.  He sits down and listens to some music.  This is the movie's first shot of something that will get him,  the main characters, out of this world.  The next thing you know he's in a spaceship and he's being taught how to fly.  If you've never seen a good science fiction movie then you can't understand what a special time it was back in the 1960's.  I never understood why we couldn't get a movie like this from the 1960s,  what they had back then was nothing like this movie.  You'd go to the movies just to watch the people look so cool while flying.  There's a lot more to this movie than just the flying scenes.  In the second half of the movie there is an episode of the Sci Fi Channel called "Science Fiction TV."  This episode features the movie "Men in Black."  It is also in the Sci-Fi Channel and is even better than this movie (though it is a movie).   So there you go you now have a great idea for a movie,  I just wish it didn't end up being one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little apprehensive when I first watched the first act of this film. The first five minutes seemed like the movie was going to be an episode of  The Andy Griffith Show. That didn't last long, however.   The plot was a lot like a sitcom, which was a breath of fresh air for me.  In a town that is full of oddity,  Dr. Eureka's house was like a mini version of a home.  While the characters, including the young couple, seemed like their personalities and lives were completely different, they were more alike than different.  There was a great sense of joy about the whole movie.  I don't think I'd want a sequel to this movie. The ending left a bad taste in my mouth, however, and I don`t think I would recommend this to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title says it all.  This film is a story about a little girl who's just lost her father.  She lives in a village called Yoh.   It's a pretty place with a couple of families, and the villagers help out those families when they're in need.  It was a sad tale, but it was pretty well done.  The film also tells the story of a young man who gets involved with the Yoh villagers.  He has a small son named Nellie who is a little sister-like character.  While Nell is a good little girl, the main character is somewhat of a boy.  If you're looking for a happy, nice family movie to bring to your family, this might be just what you're waiting for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is like a fantasy made from the same stuff that make movies magical to those who love it.   "Weird" is the word that best describes this movie, there is a lot of fun here, which you can't really find in the normal movie.  In "Wendell, I'm In Love Again", we have a guy who works at a restaurant where he keeps to himself and gets a bit too close to the customers, but he is still able to keep a proper distance, yet in order to get them to like him he tries to show his "strange" side.  Well, I can see his odd behavior and the lack of "strangeness" of the restaurant. But this movie is a total surprise and a total shock.  One of my favorite movies I have seen in a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would like to add that there are a couple of things I would've changed if I could: First, I would add some more music and more sound effects. The sounds in this movie are really pretty. I really like the musical score. And the sound effects in the action scenes are really quite good. And if you want to see a great action scene, check out the one in the hotel at night when the bad guy is walking around in his underwear while he watches his wife and kid having sex.   The bad guy would have looked better if he was wearing a big black dress.  It would have made for a much more dramatic scene.    And yes, this is a movie for the ladies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a result of the excellent special effects and acting, this film is one of my favorites.  The story follows the character of a teacher who is forced to travel back in time to prevent his young daughter from becoming a nun.  It is a fairly good movie that takes place during a busy year during which the students are having trouble with life, family and the world.      The film is well acted and well acted actors play their roles well.  I would like to see a movie like this every year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a nice story line but not a real twist or much to see in a movie that is pretty much about a man and a woman and a kid who are all trying to survive. The story doesn't seem to be that important with the little boy just running around looking for something that he may find at a strange house with the man just watching the kids play but it's very silly to a point that it may get your heart racing. The family that is there is just about everyone from a mother, father, a boy who likes to be naughty and a girl who likes getting into trouble. I don't really care about it but the movie is silly and silly and stupid.   The acting is good with all of them and most of it is just people playing their parts. A little boy that is about ten to twelve years old. His mother, dad, and older sister all just sit there doing nothing. There are not a lot of scenes with them but those that there are are just for show and are not really anything that makes them interesting or funny at all. The best thing about the movie was when they took all the old movies and made new ones of the same scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a fun, silly movie, filled with lots of slapstick, and the characters are all really silly, but it has a lot more heart to it than I expected. It has a strong message about racism in America, and a great little scene where the black sheriff sees a black guy getting on the bus and he looks at him and says, "You ain't never gonna make it." And I'm sure there are other things like that in it, as well, and while I was watching it, it was hard to put down.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie, a great romance, and a very emotional movie! It is also the first of the "Twilight" series.   I love it so much!   When we are introduced to Twilight's new family, we immediately get a good look at their relationship. It is a very sweet and affectionate relationship between a man and his sweet but stern wife.  This movie is very much "Couples Retreat" meets "Jungle Fever"   The movie is also very good at providing some great acting from the cast, especially Twilight's mom.  The romance is very good and is really a heartwarming story!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My parents gave me this movie in a drive-by.   It had a great plot, but the acting was so awful, I didn't like it at all.  The girl (who plays the girl's mother) is such a whiney, entitled crybaby who can't hold down a job.  She can't find a man, can't date a man.  Then the guy who plays the boyfriend is such an asshole, constantly calling her a bitch and a cunt and she can't get over it.  What's worse is she seems to have a big crush on him, but I'm pretty sure it's just a phase for her.  I wish the guy had not been such an ass.  But then she falls in love with him and I wish she hadn't.  So far, I'm disappointed.

I do have a couple gripes about the ending, but they're all minor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An important film about two great guys in a difficult but inspiring situation.   This film is a great story and a great movie.  It's about two men who want to take down the big bad, but who are held back by two great people who help them and help themselves.  This isn't a romantic story and it's not a sentimental film.  But it is a story about two people, who are being held back, by two people who want a better world.  In a way, it's a really inspiring film to watch.  There's a lot of people who don't want the world to change because it's just so boring and ordinary.  That's true, and that's the problem.  The film talks about things that are important.  And when I say important, I mean the way they are.  I didn't think it would be good when I first saw it.  My mother loved it, my dad liked it, and my best friend really liked it. But it was hard to watch in a theater.  One of the things that made this film is the use of great actors.  Because of the roles that they play in this film, the characters become real people.  Especially the leads.  When the two men are working to take out a corrupt government and a corrupt corporation, we see them play out their fantasies of what they want to do.  We see them act, we watch them do these things, and we feel sorry for them and we sympathize with them.  They are not perfect.  Their love is not pure, but it's there.  A lot of us have done things that we wish we could have done, but we never had the courage to try.  For the rest of us, there are people out there who have had to do things that maybe we would not have had the balls to do, but they did.  These two people show that some people do have the balls.  As long as you understand that you can change, and you can be a part of something good, and the future isn't all bleak and grey,  then you can go forth and make a difference.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first ever horror film ever (well, I guess that's a slight exaggeration) I think I've really hit it big with this one! I was not expecting to enjoy it at all! The beginning scenes of the film were pretty awful and at first I thought the film was not funny but after a few minutes I was hooked. The movie is just as it seems it's about a couple of children whose father goes missing and the poor kid's mother is forced to care for the kids alone. It didn't take long before I found out this was a family with a secret they have to hide from the world. I love the acting in this one because it didn't feel fake like other horror films I've seen! It had a really creepy feel to it with a lot of weird things going on. At times, the film felt really eerie but I guess it was to be expected with a movie like this. I would definitely recommend this to any horror film fans because it's a unique experience!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a horror movie with some weird humor. The story was pretty basic but the character interaction and humor were good. The movie is scary, but not too scary. I didn't find the ending disturbing at all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent movie from a great director!   In the late '70's, a former astronaut is sent to Mars to see what it is like and how a human can survive on the Martian surface. While on the way, he is chased by an alien, who he fights, then the alien returns to tell him the story about a group of people living on Mars who made a deal with an alien and they were all killed in a nuclear fire. They then make a new pact with another alien who is supposed to make a planet on Earth habitable, but they have to fight the aliens in order to make the planet habitable.   It is not really a story about space aliens or about Mars. It is a film that makes us think about life and death, and it does not waste time with meaningless dialogues.  There are a few technical difficulties and a few long takes that are very unimportant but they don't matter to the overall plot and the movie is enjoyable in spite of these flaws.  This movie is a very enjoyable ride.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When we first saw the trailer, I was ready to tear my hair out. The trailers were often so ridiculous that I could tell they weren't even trying. It just looked so cheap and unfunny. I knew this movie was going to be bad, but it still amazed me how poorly the production was done.   This movie was shot in the 90s, and I was surprised by how cheap the production looked, but not the bad acting.  The movie was definitely made by someone with very little experience working on a movie.  I don't know if this movie will be a cult classic, but if it is, it sure isn't a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is the first in a series about the war between Russia and America (it should have been called America and Russia ), set during the Cold War. This war began at the beginning of WW I and ended at the end of the war in the latter half of WWII. For some reason the two main characters are not Americans and are not really fighting for anything. Instead they are just living their own lives: a retired engineer living in a small town called Krasnovskaya (I think I heard about this town on a Russian radio show) is a retired war hero and he runs a small hotel in a Russian village called Stavropol, which is very popular among the locals. In the village there is a very beautiful village school (about 40 students) who are not interested in the war or the school. They are rather interested in reading and painting (at the moment there is one very beautiful boy who is about 12 years old). The main characters: the Russian girl, the English girl, and the German boy.   The only thing I found to be slightly disturbing was the sex scenes. I have seen a few scenes like this, and they usually end very early, but not this time. The sex was not just "tit for tat" and this movie really should not have gone this way, especially because one of the main characters (the main German boy) was about 13 when he was in the US army during WW I. The scenes where the Germans and Russians fight in Russia were more interesting, though.  My rating:  (no stars)

Kenji is a really bad-ass high schooler that knows all the secrets!   I would watch this movie again just to see all the cool gadgets Kenji has...  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a big fan of the "T" family of films. Some good fun with a good plot, some good acting, good cinematography, but no real connection to the original. Thats why when this came out I went in thinking it would be a bit of a miss.   And I was right.  In terms of plot and characters, there is a lot going on. It is all very well planned but really, this has a fairly standard "T"-like feel. And I guess I could have said the same about the whole film:  - a lot of different things happen and it seems as if the movie could have been told in a few hours and I could see the point, but I suppose it could have done with a bit more time.  - it doesn't have a very good voice acting and some of the dialogue is rather awkward.  It was a good little "T".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie for fans of the original The Goonies who also have a nostalgic connection to Disney classics like The Rescuers, The Three Caballeros and The Black Cauldron.   The original Goonies are back!    And it's not just a re-boot, this film is an excellent addition to the series.  Like the other films of this series, this is a retelling of the events that occurred between The Goonies #1 and The Goons #2, but with a much more comedic bent.  The Goones have never been the bad guys, nor are they the only ones with skeletons in their closets, but like the other four films in this series they can't keep a secret and are hunted down by a mysterious villain named Dr. Facilier.  His name is also the name of the villain in a book by William Blake, one of the greatest poets of all time. The Goonic villain was supposed to be a major character in the original Goons movie, but he was killed in the first cut.  But Facilierre's identity is finally revealed in this film, along with his ultimate plan. He wants to revive a medieval English castle that has been abandoned by the French during World War I.  When the Goonies first come into the castle he's already in the process of bringing it back to life. It's a little like a time machine.  He summons a few Goonies in the form of a few ghosts, and they each do something to try and restore the castle to its former glory.  A lot of these Goon costumes were made for the original film, but they are a little different from the other film.  Some of them, like the original costume, look quite cool.  And one of my favorite costumes is the one worn by the "Goone" who has the most amazing red lipstick.  This film also includes the only appearance of the Goons' arch nemesis, Dr. Face.  It's never really explained how Dr. Mask got into the Goon's lair, but I've always thought it had something to do with a series of paintings.  Dr. Faces mask, if you will.  As you can tell by this description, I have a problem with the Goony films.  They start off strong, but then lose their way and are really only enjoyable because of a single character.  Sure, they are fun to watch, but most

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie so much that I don't know why I didn't find it sooner. It is the perfect combination of comedy and romance; the two best parts of a bad movie: a) the way the plot comes out; and b) the cast. The romantic comedy is a very good combination of good acting and funny dialogue.   The best parts are the two first scenes, when the main character comes home with the girl and the man looks at him and says, "It's not fair, this man is so lucky!"   That's a really good line for a movie; the same kind of line will appear in an opera, but in a movie: it's the funniest line ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a big, dumb, and somewhat stupid action movie coming out on January 4th. And this stupid movie is, like, right up there with the worst of the worst. The film is called "The Expendables". It is a movie with a bunch of "action" actors, some of them not that good at acting, and all of them really dumb. "The Expedibles" is also an overproduced, cheesy, and completely pointless movie, and while the stars of this movie are all pretty good, they are not the stars. They are not even the best of the group. The most pathetic action movie I have ever seen is "The Rocketeer".   When I heard about this movie, I was intrigued. And it turns out, "The EXPEDIBLES" is another "action movie" with a few good actors, and a lot of boring action. This movie will make you laugh with its absurd action and stupid dialogue. It is only good for the first 15 minutes or so. After that it falls apart, and gets really really stupid, and really really dumb to boot.   The first 15 or so minutes are just silly. There is no real plot. No real point. There are a lot a characters in this movie: Sylvester Stallone (Bruce Willis) is an "action hero" (and that's really about it), but he does not have a real action role in this picture. The other "action stars" in this film are: Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jason Statham (also known as the "Camel Man"). And we have the "lead actor" in the movie, Nicolas Cage. This guy is so stupid, it is almost comical. I mean, it's not even funny, really. It's just annoying.  The plot here is basically that there are three mercenaries (Stallone, Willis, and Statham) who are fighting off some bad guys who are destroying a city. But the real bad guys are actually two bad guys. One of them is a "psychopath" who hates everyone, but loves "killing people." The other bad guy is a pretty bad guy, but he is really bad because he wants to "save everyone" by destroying everything. In order to do this, he is willing to destroy the very city he is destroying. But there is one person, a reporter (played by an annoying little girl

But this movie is so much more than a soundtrack.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. It was well written, and did a good job of taking on a subject that really has no good solution.   It was a hard movie to review.  It is very serious about the whole thing. It does a good number on its main character. But there are some parts that make it really hard. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie takes a good idea and makes it a really good one. It is really sad how the story has been told and I could not believe what I was seeing. It was a good surprise that this was coming out after it had been off the air for 6 years.   I will definitely be watching it again when it comes up on DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about an Indian man, Rajni Kulkarni, who was a very good detective. The movie had more plot lines than I could bear. Some scenes were very dull. Some parts were not so good. The characters were not likeable. The action was very good. Rajni is good in his actions, but sometimes he shows some weaknesses in his thinking. He makes a mistake in his methods. I don't like to like a good detective like this, but I don`t mind.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The whole idea of "Namakaye" (a Japanese word which translates to "The White Woman" in English) is brilliant!   The film is based on a true story of a Japanese woman named Namako.   Namako had been sent to live with an American family in New York when her father was called away to fight in World War II.  After the war ended she moved to Japan to study painting and her own unique style.  While there she discovered she could speak English and she became a fashion model, a dancer and a socialite.  Namakaye is the story of how her own life changed during the course of these events.  The only problem is, Namako has a very unusual personality and personality change throughout the film.  I'm a sucker for a movie about the woman in the white hat.  A simple yet intriguing storyline!  Namaku is an interesting character to watch, she's a very interesting character and I enjoyed the time spent with her.  It was a fascinating experience watching a woman with a strong personality change from someone I knew to a totally different person.  For a non-Japanese audience the language is spoken very well and it makes you curious to see what kind of stories are coming out of her mouth.  From a story-telling standpoint, it's very clever in how it handles the changes of Namakaye.  If there is anything I can complain about, it would be that I found it a bit confusing to figure out exactly how things played out in the end.  My review:  I give this film a 3.5 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a great movie. There was not a lot of story here and the movie is filled with action. But the great part is that there is a romance that happens.   So good. It is a great story that is filled up with action, comedy, love and the whole works. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case you're not a big fan of a certain genre - and it's a genre I'm a big aficionado of - this movie is for you. It's really entertaining, not a typical horror movie, but something that is not really scary, but has a sense of humour about it. It is an enjoyable comedy about a guy who comes home to find a dead body in his room. It turns out that the man has killed his own girlfriend - something that isn't a big shock to the guy, but which causes him to go a little crazy. After getting out of jail, the guy goes and gets the body back (of course) and then goes and kills the man he thought had been his girlfriend. The film ends with an amusing twist when the guy finds a letter from his girlfriend, telling him that she has gone to get help and to come see her tomorrow. It ends on a good high note for sure.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first part of this film is very good. I like it.   I liked the fact that the camera follows a girl around for a while (a young girl and her mom who is looking for her). It's quite interesting to watch a kid so young playing around in her home. I don't want to give much away, but it has a good story line. I was not a fan of the music and I know it was recorded at a young age, but if that was the only issue I had with it, I would give it a good rating. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is really great. I am a real fan of horror movies and this one really surprised me. The movie is very creepy and the plot is quite interesting. It is pretty much like a good ghost story, if a ghost story with a lot of horror. The ending of the movie is great and the ending of this movie is so good I can't stop watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very good movie. My wife and I love it, but it takes a little while to get there. I think a lot of people have gotten used to the way it looks, and then, after a while, it is a little more realistic.   I also love the "twist" that is put on the end of this movie!   It is not your standard Hollywood "chick-flick", it is really something else.  This movie made us feel like we were in another world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's about a guy whose family is from a poor family in rural Ireland and now he wants to move to a big city to become a lawyer like his father. So they have a vacation trip to England and they end up at the pub where the local lord and lady have invited them to stay overnight. It's a great film because of the great acting. It doesn't really have a happy ending though it's still a good film even if it was all over the place with a bunch of different characters that you get to meet.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (This is a spoiler: the movie is amazing.)   This movie does exactly what it set out to do: to make us look into the mirror of another.   The movie is not simply about the story behind the movie, but it is about a man's journey to reconcile with his father, his brother, and a new friend who becomes important.  The story of a man who is driven by the need to be loved by his father and his new friend, who he can't really love, who helps him to reconcile.  It is a movie that deals with the pain and the hope of human existence.  And I can not recommend this movie enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny little movie about a bunch of kids who are all "gifted" with a rare "super hero" ability, called the Power of Five. The only problem is that they don't know when to use it, or how to use their powers.   It has a little of everything: Superheroes, super fights, super pranks and a good love story.  The only flaw of the movie is the lack of a villain. The story could be a little more complex but I was never bored by this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting the first part to be rather dull, with most of the movie being spent by the protagonist in a school room playing video games (i'm sure there's a way to do something else that doesn't involve killing people and you don't have to like it) The first part of the film is probably the most boring part of any of this films (and to be fair the movie is not that bad) I was not that surprised to find out that the kid has a serious mental problem (which i found out on the first viewing of the second part) The rest of the movies is good, although the last one might be too dark for some people to handle, i can understand that though.   Recommended for: people who love the first and second part of this trilogy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born in '68 and I am 43. I never grew up in New York. My mother lives in New Jersey and my father lives in Connecticut. I was in 7th grade when my parents moved back to Connecticut. It was the last year of school and a big change for me. I loved going to New York for high school, and my school had a very eclectic and unique music, dance, theater and art curriculum. I would study that curriculum every week to see what kind of talent I had. I went to an all-girls private school where the female teachers were incredibly talented. They were all singers, dancers, actresses and musicians. It is not an easy school to go to. We had lots of great instructors that worked on developing and strengthening my body and mind. I took music and art classes from a teacher named Dr. John. He was an incredible teacher who did a wonderful job developing me as a person. He taught me to speak in sentences, write, draw and to sing. He gave me the ability to express myself and he encouraged me to use my talent. He told me, "When you sing like that, you get recognized." Dr.John and I had many conversations and we connected very well. He loved to talk about different things. We would discuss the weather, music, movies and books and anything that would make us laugh. My favorite teacher was Mr. Ewing, who lived about a block from me. He took me to his house to teach me his piano. He would show me every day. He had a nice piano and it was really easy to play. I always asked to be able to play it. Mr.Ewing would take me to the local diner where I would sit down and play my piano while the food was being prepared. Sometimes I would play in the backroom of the diner. We were at a piano bar called Piano Bar. I met a guy named Mr. Bierbaum. He liked to sing and he could play the piano really well. I got his phone number and he sent me an album with some great songs he had composed for me (I don't remember all of them, but I'm pretty sure they were the ones). He called me to ask if I wanted to play piano at his house. My mom, who loved to cook, said "No." He asked for my permission, I gave it, and I decided to go. I ended up sitting on the floor with a

In A Day in the Life (1989), a family of four was taken to a carnival.  The first stop, a carnicle ride, made us laugh, but then the movie began and we both had to watch it.  It's a classic and the last time I was in a theater with a Christmas film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this with my family for Christmas morning. It was a very nice movie that is about a guy named Paul that lives with his wife in an old house. They live in a nice old house and are very nice people who do their best for each other. Paul is always trying to improve and help the house run better and better. He was trying to help his wife with the chores and they were getting more and more upset as the days went on. He is an only son so he is worried about his siblings but he keeps trying to show them he loves them. He tries to help them all and eventually it seems like they will all be able to do a better job at housework and chores. The movie had a great soundtrack and the story line was very good. I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys movies about nice people doing a good job and living a good life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just came to the theater yesterday to see this movie in which I was very impressed with its storyline and characters. It is very dark in its plot, I would like to say that it is a film that can show the true life of the Mafia in a way that I cannot think of a better one than this movie. I like the cinematography that has an eerie feel about it and I found it very engaging to watch it. The movie was great in the way that it had its own style that is unique to it and a way of showing how they do things to make sure they can do anything with the money that is going to be made. They take the money from the Mafia families and they make sure to keep a lot of it for themselves and the police to find so that they can continue to make more money. I would have liked to see a little more of the backstory of the gangsters and they way they interact with the Mafia family and their families. In the movie, it is all about the money and how it gets to the top of the hill so that it can buy some of the other families.   This movie is very different in the sense that the mafia are the only ones that do not know about the drug business and they do not try to prevent or stop it and they let the drug businesses continue to grow and grow until it is completely out of control. It should be noted that I have seen many movies that try to show the world about Mafia and gangsters but this movie was not about the Mafia. This movie made me to want to know the Mafia as well as the gangster and it made me want to see their back stories. This is a great movie for people who like gangster movies and they should not miss this one. It can be seen on VHS or DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An old western, in which a sheriff must rescue a band of Indians from a mountain ambush by a bandit clan, and a man trying to get rid of a deadly curse that threatens to turn a man into a buffalo. This movie has the action, adventure and comedy of a Western in a unique setting. There is no romanticism here, but the romance is present enough to make it tolerable, and the characters seem like good old-fashioned Americans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:        "Gimme a break! This movie has everything you want out of a great Western: a good old fashioned Western. Not all westerns are that good though, and this one is. I could watch it over and over. The story is really old, but really well told. I really can't say enough good things about it. A must watch, and you'll enjoy it as much as I did!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was excited about this movie, it has a lot of action, lots of characters, and it was great! I watched it in the theater, it was a lot to take in but I had a good time.   The action scenes are really funny and a lot better than the other movies. The villain's name was a little hard to say because of the accents, he was so loud in his accent and it really made it hard to understand what he was saying. But when he was yelling at his daughter, I was laughing so hard. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie started as a real story of a young girl going back to her father's farm in the country when her mother went off to university in England. This story was very moving for me and I remember thinking how sad my mother would have been if she had not had her daughter. I was never a big fan of the movies and had no idea what to expect.   I was not disappointed at all. The acting was good and the movie was well acted and directed.  A great movie to sit through.

The acting was really good and the plot really intrigued me. However, the movie is not for the weak of heart. The plot revolves around a group of high school boys who are going on a camping trip and have to make a deal with a mysterious young woman, who they seem to be able to trust and respect. They have an adventure all over the place and learn some things about what love is all about. This movie is full of good stuff and is one of the good movies I've seen in a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was made for one purpose and one purpose only: It is the best horror movie I have ever seen.   I have never seen a movie like this in my life.  For one it does not try to be a horror movie; it is a horror film.  This is a movie about a guy named Jason who gets his head chopped off.  The best way I can put it is this: He is not in a movie theater.  He is in a room in a hotel called The Chateau Marmont with his wife Meryl Streep.  It seems that Jason, Meryl and Meryl's daughter have been married for a long time.  Jason's father has died and Mengele has found Meryl to be too old and so, he decides to get rid of her.  Meryl has two things she has been searching for all her life. One is her father, and the other is Jason.  She was on a trip with her father (from her memory) to a cemetery where he is buried.  During their trip, Mengely finds Jason.   Mengeles is there to kill Jason. Mengelys wants Jason dead because Jason is not like Mengels parents and he has made a couple of his father's friends to work with him to kill the old man's son.  I like to think Jason is a good person.  After the head chopping Jason is in the hospital and when Mengey has him back there, Menevens comes and holds him over a balcony (he also puts Jason in a coffin).   Jason tries to escape by going over the balcony but Menevers and his men catch him and put him back in the room with Meryl.  Once he is back in there with his friends and Menevis has him cut his own head off. He tries to save Meryl but she is dying.  And you think Jason and Micevens are in love.  They have been for so long.  You start thinking Micevis and Jason are in a love triangle, they are both in love with Meneves but then Jason is forced to kill Menevise because she is so old that she is about to die.  Now Jason is alone with Manceves head.  His father, Munges friend and a couple friends have been waiting for a chance to kill him.  But Jason is the only one who can kill him
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great! I don't think I have seen a better movie about the "Great Depression". It deals with a large group of poor people who were trapped in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Most people from this town had little to no jobs and no place to go. They had no family and no one to help them out. This movie follows this small group and their attempts to overcome these disadvantages.   I thought that this was a great movie. It really shows the small things that people had to endure in order to get by. Even though the movie was about this very group of people, it really touched on many things that the viewer could relate to. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent and well-executed thriller in which the story of a group of friends who are taking part in a national park hike through a mountain range is made even more thrilling by the fact that they have to hike in darkness, in a forest of giant lichen and with a lack of compass. The plot is fascinating, the dialogue is interesting and the acting is also strong, so I can't say much more than that.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The King of Kong" is a good time, for sure.   In a way, it is a love letter to classic monster movies, especially those featuring Godzilla.  In this particular film, we have a new Kong, a baby Kong (voiced by Bill Duke) who is raised in the care of a woman named Jane (Bethany Joy Lenz).   Once she is older and a little older, Kong becomes angry at the world and his caretaker, and goes on a rampage.  He ends up attacking a ship full of men who are trying to bring him back to his mother.  They manage to destroy him in the process, but Jane ends up getting shot by one of the bullets, and becomes a real Kong.    The movie ends with a nice little sequence of the old King being visited by Jane, who tells him his true destiny, and to take up his mother's mantle as her protector.  This is a movie that has a nice cast, and a nice soundtrack (thanks to John Barry).  It isn't anything super special, but is fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember when I first started watching the movie. I saw it the first time on a Friday night. And I liked it, I laughed and felt for the characters. After watching a few more movies I was ready to see the movie again. I had to wait for a couple of days to see it. And again I enjoyed the movie but I still felt sorry for a lot of the characters that they had to deal with. And they still don't get what they want. They try to go and do things for the sake of the movie's story but end up hurting themselves. This movie is not only a story of a man who wants to be a hero but of a human being who wants more than anything to be able to live in a good place. It shows you how we live in this world and how much we depend on things that seem to be impossible to get. This is a story about a man trying to go for what he wants, and not wanting to do the wrong things just for the money. He tries to be the person people think he is by being what he is.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The most interesting movie I saw in a long while. I am really glad I saw this movie because it was a great film and was very thought provoking. I liked how the script was written because there was no real characters and it all happened in a day or a week. It didn't really happen like a movie, more like an actual thing, that is. However, I think the movie was done by someone who is very passionate about his work and a lot of people would like to see him again and I really don't understand why he hasn't made more movies. I love the movie and it is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a great, well crafted tale of a mysterious little boy named David. David is on a journey to find his father, who has vanished into the Bermuda Triangle while David was still a toddler. When David is nearly run over by a freight train and has to go into a coma, he meets a little girl named Sophie and his grandfather, a sort of father figure who seems to have a great affection for David, but David does not feel quite right with him.   It's pretty much the story of an eccentric old man trying to figure out how to bring David back to life. It's a little strange how he can seem to know a lot about David just by looking at his face, like he is the most famous person in the world (or at least that's what the other people seem to think).   In this film, David is the perfect embodiment of the classic Disney hero - a little boy who wants to explore the world, but is too naive and sensitive for most people, not understanding what a real world is like. It is really interesting to see how people react to him and how he changes as his relationship with Sophie changes.  The way he slowly becomes more and more like an adult is really amazing and shows a lot of depth in the character.    The animation is great and is a part of what makes this film great.  They have done a great job with the backgrounds, but when it comes to character designs, they don't quite match up to the rest of the work.  While most of the characters in the film are pretty typical, the one that stands out is David's grandfather, the eccentric and mysterious man who looks to David for guidance and help.  It was very interesting to find out about this man and find out how he is able to understand David without speaking a word.  This was a great addition to the Disney canon and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just received a copy of this movie today. This is a fantastic flick. I think it is good for both adults and children. There is an interesting cast of characters that are different but likeable. There are a lot of action scenes and some humorous moments. My only complaint is that it takes a while to get into the film but once you get into it you enjoy it very much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie I've been waiting for the longest time, now I got it!   They make it look easy.   And it is.  If you watch this movie in 2 days it will be fun.  This movie is an adventure of the three friends and their pet chameleon who's name is Bouncer.  They are going to explore the jungle together and make some new friends along the way.  What I like most about this movie is the humor.  I like how Bouncier has a sense of humor too.  There are so many jokes in the movie but I don't know how to tell them apart.  Bouncil and his pet chamare are traveling all over the place.  But in the end they meet a group of little children, the Chameleons.  The kids tell them about their lives, about the big bad tiger that eats their pets and so on.  So Bounctor and Bouncam start to get the Chameleon's respect, which is how Boonie comes to know about the jungle.   BounCam wants to take Bounboun on a big adventure, but Bouncar wants to stay with his pet.  But there's also a good chance that they will fall in love and the movie has a very romantic ending.  Here's a hint for a more romantic ending:  It is a good idea for your pets to be pets and not real friends.  One time Bounbot got in a fight with his chameleonic buddy and Boonibou had to tell him to leave the chamelette alone.

While the main character is a little slow in getting used to his new home, there's no problem finding the right movie to show him.  It's an old-timey sort of film; you get that feeling of the early 1900's, with the old-fashioned home, the old people and the family dog.  And of course there are the famous "daddy issues"   and the "dads"

A lot of things happened at the same time, but the film never gets lost in it's action scenes.

The story is pretty great. i did enjoy the fact that it wasnt just a simple story like a lot of animated movies out there. It had an interesting style to it, and i thought it was great.   What i really liked about this was how they did all the different characters and brought them together into one story. It also had a very great ending, which i thought was a really nice touch.  A little something I liked:  There is a scene where a girl is getting her hair cut. When she is about to get her hair done she thinks that it looks really weird and tries to say that it does not look too good but the person behind the bar does not understand her and does not do anything to help her. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to watch a great horror movie you should see this movie  !   This is the movie I have been waiting for since the first time I saw a horror movie on a VHS.   It is a very funny movie that I love the jokes, they are clever and funny and are very funny.  Also I love how they have the big scary guys from outer space.  The plot is interesting but not really good.  It seems like the movie is trying to be as horror as it can be but it's not.  I think that they made it for the kids and they didn't do a very good job.  What a great movie, so good, so funny and it does a great job of being scary.  My kids really like this movie because they get a laugh out of it and it's so funny!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like your movies scary and gritty but you don't like to see zombies or vampires or werewolves then you're going to like this movie. You don't see a lot of films about werewolves so this is a very well done movie. The acting is great. The story is fun and well told. It's a very dark movie. And I would love to see another movie with this premise. I wish I could give this a 10.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An unusual choice for a film about a group of college students in love. One of the most amusing films I have seen this year. The characters are amusing and the story is engaging.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie.   It has a good plot, a well-developed and believable lead character, a good cast of characters, and even better visual effects than the original.  I do like the sound, however it is slightly more melodramatic than the TV series, though I doubt this could really be called melodrama.  The special effects are probably the best yet, I like the new effects more than the old ones.  Some people, however, seem to think that this film is a copy of the television series, a bit of a stretch in my opinion.  But it is still a good film, an interesting movie about a new generation of computer hackers that make a difference in the world, and it is worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my book, the movie is a good adaptation of a really good story:  And while the film has its moments, it is still a solid and entertaining movie, with a nice cast of characters (although some don't really feel like real characters, but I guess this was an adaptation of an original story):   This was a fun movie, that has a really nice story and it's pretty well done.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited to see the new, well made, and really pretty, The Purge. It was the kind of movie that I wanted to see. I've been looking for a movie like this for a long time. After hearing about a new franchise, I knew I wanted this one! I also wanted to learn about the Purge before I watched it. So, I've heard about some people on reddit going to the movie and the story line is cool! Now let's get to the review:  I would like to start off with a very important thing to note about The Purging. It's a movie that starts out very innocently. You see two kids, a girl and a boy, get the power to go around town killing everyone. There is no killing in The Purged, just a couple of kids being hunted down by the Purged. The film takes a while to get going but once you get into the swing of it you are pretty much entertained the whole time. It doesn't take long until you see one of the boys being brutally murdered by a child murderer. After that, it's just a bunch of children running around killing the Purges. But it's all fun and games until the end when things take a turn. It took a bit for the audience to realize that something was wrong with the film. The beginning and the middle were really enjoyable but as the film progressed things became really dark. I'm sorry to say that the film did not pick up until the last twenty minutes. It had the usual stuff with guns, murder, etc., but there was a dark underbelly about what was going on here that you wouldn't normally get. Then, the film becomes a story about a small town being taken over by a group of people who want to purge the town. The first part of the film is about a boy who can kill any Purge that comes around and is on a mission to take down a Purge from a different state. The boy's name is Billy and his dad is the town leader, Mr. Rook. You have the Purging coming to this small town but a man named Mr. Gully runs it. But Gully is also on a Purging mission so that he can rid the town of its evil and get rid of it in one fell swoop. Billy tries to stop him but is really killed by a Purged and falls in a pit. Then the girl is revealed to be the daughter
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story:  In the not so distant past in a not so far away land where there is a lot of magic, monsters, and magic. And, yes, magic in a pretty good sense in the hands of a decent but slightly awkward young man who is in search of something to fight for and in a way it is an old-fashioned adventure film about good guys and bad guys.  In this film the young man is a wizard named Tom. And his friends and associates are elves, dwarves, witches, a dragon and a witch named Derry (Linda Hamilton).  So Tom is a young but talented young man that has a little to no interest in women, and just isn't all that popular.  He is also kind of a slob and very shy and quiet. But there's not a lot else going for him at the start of the film. In fact, his parents don't love him much either.  Tom finds a book about a magical castle in a faraway place that he is determined to get into, and there is no better way to get it then by joining the castle guards as a squire.   Tom wants to be a hero, and in this film he is no slouch as a man or as a wizard. The plot is interesting enough and the action is pretty cool.  The film is a little on the slow side at times but it certainly isn't that bad.   This is another one of those films that is best appreciated on a big screen in a theater full of people and with a decent soundtrack (like in the case of 'Funny Girl' which was a good film, but you know, more like the Disney variety show).   I'm still a little underwhelmed at the end of the movie and think that it could have been better if it had been a little longer and with more film to work with.  It could have used some better direction and I am not a big fan of the ending.  But still, a fun little adventure with a good script.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The characters are likeable.   He's your normal guy with a girlfriend and a bad temper that is never appeased.  In a perfect world he would have the girl, but when his mother dies of cancer, he doesn't understand why he keeps finding himself with other women.  When he goes to a meeting with a friend who is going to marry his sister, he sees a handsome stranger.  He doesn't know what to think, he's got no idea who this guy is, and he doesn-t have any interest in him.  They get in the car and get lost for a while.  After that they realize they are in the wrong country and he has to work for a week and come home.  The friend who runs the store is a nice guy who is nice to him. I'm glad that this movie was made in 1981, when there were lots of bad films about the same type of man and his sister.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, if you like horror, if this is your thing and you're on the edge of your seat, then you're in for a real treat.   I'm a huge fan of the films of Stephen King. I'm not sure what the reason for the remake is. Was it the director's desire to make something of himself? Or is it more of a sequel? I think the director did an excellent job.    I can't recommend it highly enough.  MOVIE:  "IT"

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You could not find a worse, most unnecessary, over the top, and yet somehow completely effective   plot device in any of the movies from the 1970s.   The film does a very poor job of getting the audience to care about the characters and the story but it works.  They put in one of the most over thetop and unprofessional voiceover performances  that I have ever heard.  The plot is a bit silly but the ridiculous action and silly dialogue makes it funny for the most part.  I laughed out loud at a few jokes.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, get it before the video copies sell out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie, with a twist at the end.   One of the most popular and acclaimed action movies of all time, this is an action movie for the ages. It really sets the tone for what the genre was going to be after the first two films.  While the ending might be a bit too much, this movie does not let you down.  The movie does have its share of bad guys (like the guy with the crossbow), but they are hardly ever as bad as one might expect.  And, as always, Bruce Willis is great.  I did see this movie during the "Avengers" summer event (which is also included in this movie).   It was a fun summer movie with a fun plot.  At the time of writing, I was about six months ago and I really like this movie.  It really has everything.  If you like action movies, then you will really like the movie. I just wish that it would have been released a bit later so that people could have seen a little bit more of what was going on.  So, if you want to see a movie about a guy that uses an arsenal of high-tech weapons (and a special armor that lets him blend into the environment) and the girl that is trying to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, I highly recommend that you check this movie out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie a few months ago and I'm very impressed.   A movie that I'm sure will stay with me and is sure to be on my list.  This is a very good film.  An old fashioned horror movie with a nice cast and good special effects.  I was really surprised how well it was shot.  If you are into ghost movies you should check this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie of all time    I'll take a moment to talk about the movie.   The film is based on a series of novels by Walter M. Miller which I haven't read.  It's an excellent movie. It's a brilliant story told by one of the greatest screenwriters of all times.  Walter M Miller's films are never good, but usually great.    This film is a fine example.  What's interesting to me about the film is how it was made.  First the film features a young boy named Peter Parker who was raised by his loving and caring father.  As Peter grew up he would get into trouble and get caught by the police, he always got into trouble with the same people.  One day, while visiting his father, he accidentally killed his father and his father was really saddened by this. Peter didn't seem to be upset and didn't even seem concerned.  Peter was really quite cool and not to mention a great actor.  His father never got to talk to him after he did this, not wanting his son to go through what he went through.  And this is where this movie gets good:  Peter's father, who we never see for the most part in the film, gets sick and dies and Peter and his mother are left alone.  Their home is full of junk and a lot of drugs and alcohol.  The movie goes along for a while before we get to the point of the story.  Once again Peter is given a job at Oscorp to do his father's work.  He gets an assistant named Wendy Ross. Wendy has been in a lot better films than this one, but the one thing that keeps this movie from being a masterpiece is the constant drug use.  There is a lot going on.  Here is where the film really gets into its stride.  Wendy is introduced to Spider-Man who then begins to learn about his past.  You know the drill:  When Peter was young he lived a poor and lonely life and as a result he developed a great deal of resentment against his father. He also developed a hatred for his mother and even though his father died he is always very sad and lonely.  This is where things really start to get good.  During the course of the film he starts to get over his hatred of his parents and begins to love them.  From there we learn about how his father ran the company and worked at Osc
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got this movie because I was looking for a good, straightforward, low-cost horror movie.   The first film I saw after seeing the original was Halloween 2   and I was disappointed because it did not have the "classic" slasher-movie elements of the original.  Then I saw Slumber Party Massacre and I loved it.  This is similar to that movie in that it has slasher elements, but it does so in a much more restrained way.  The thing that I loved about Slumber House Massacre (and other slasher movies) was that it did this in a manner that still seemed like a slasher movie. The movie is just about a group of friends who attend a Halloween party and one of them is murdered.  I really enjoyed watching the movie because the only reason why the characters seem to be in so much trouble was because it seemed that the people who were with them were the only ones who would have anything to do with this.  What made this movie really cool was that a good deal of the movie is simply showing us what is being done to these people.  It was also a fun movie to watch because it was really just the slasher and his friends doing these horrible things.  After I saw the first film, I could not wait to see this one.  Now, I do not want to say that I am a bad person because this movie does not have to be a good film.  Rather, I want to note that I really think that this is a good flick to have on the shelf of a horror fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not think this was a good film. I thought it was just a bunch of random scenes all running together in a mindless manner. I could not see the movie, which is unfortunate because I have watched several of the movie sequels before and they were pretty good. This was pretty bad.   "It was not meant to be funny, it was meant to hurt. It was meant for the sake of hurt, for the pleasure of being sad. It is not funny. It has nothing to offer."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good film. A great story of a little boy trying to find his real mother, a little sister, a cat and a frog.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is one of the most realistic and well-acted film in the history of cinema and, like the other great Hollywood films, it is a work of pure genius, that combines a lot of techniques into a completely unpredictable and ingenious whole. The whole film takes place in a very close-to-realistic and yet somehow fantastic world, and is full of interesting ideas and a lot heart.   This is a perfect film for those who like to be entertained by a story, but who also like to make their own interpretation of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I should probably point out that I am not very good at horror, and this movie was an excellent way to kill a few hours. It has the standard set-up you'd expect from a movie that uses the word 'pussy' a lot. It's a woman (Sally Hawkins, a very nice actress) goes missing from a house full of her friends; when her friends go looking for her, they find a strange woman in a pool, with no legs or hands and very little clothing. Then she comes into a room with a person dressed as a woman, who tries to kill the men by making them lick the juices off her. This all looks rather tame when you think about it, but it gets progressively weirder, and I got really upset at the ending. I guess I expected to laugh at it, because it has the usual cliche plot: the hero's a boy with a broken heart, and a 'girl' with a heart of gold. The story seems pretty straightforward; they are in a house, and someone's been killing off people, including Sally, and they're getting tired of it. The thing I wasn't expecting was the 'pussies' as the men refer to them. Sally Hawkins is a real puss; I can't remember the last time I laughed at a movie, but I must admit that this movie has been a real treat for me. The special effects are excellent; Sally Hawkins looks quite a bit like a real girl, and she makes a convincing'suck-off' on the men who are all turned on by her. The film looks very pretty, and when she's all over the men, it's quite effective. The whole film is in black and white, which makes it rather scary; but there's a lovely soundtrack, too, from the singer-songwriter Billie Holiday, who played on the radio in the days of the Depression, and has a reputation for being really creepy. You will find a DVD of the movie in the UK on www.amazon.co.uk.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a few good westerns and these two were pretty good. The story of the "Wicked" and "Good Time" are very good.   There are not many good western films made during the 60's. These two are very well made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As an Indian movie-goer, I had always been aware that it would be difficult to get a film made about the life of a famous Indian singer, M R Chandrasekhar. But the film was never going to be made due to the poor reputation of the artiste. This was a film to break through the misconceptions about the songwriter and make the public realize what a great singer M R was. This film is a good film on Indian Culture and shows how Indian people think in a traditional manner. It also is a film about people in different parts of India, the film depicts life in the villages. The film also tells about life in other places in India which are not as developed as the villages in this film. In this film, M is also shown with his wife and family. The movie is about life of M and his life in India and his love for his wife. The way the story is told, it is not the typical one. A good film.

It was all well acted and with a great storyline.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember being in elementary school, sitting around the kitchen table eating cake and listening to my parents talk about how they couldn't go to movies, because they didn't want to be associated with those who saw things for what they were, who enjoyed violent, gory movies and didn't think they were very good.   After watching this movie, I knew my parents were right. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie on opening night of The American Film Institute's Film Festival and it was a hit with the audience. The movie was quite good, and I liked the premise of the movie because I didn't understand the way the "humanoids" are able to survive in space. I think it's a good way to do it because the movie never really gave a good explanation why the humans live in space and how they can keep all their physical needs in their bodies. I also liked the way that the movie took you from one point to another. I would've liked to see the movie go into a different direction but for a low budget film like this one, it worked. I liked that the character of the alien wasn't portrayed as a monster.   There isn't a ton of gore or sex in this movie but it was nice to see a sci-fi movie with a decent script and characters.  I like how the movie gives you a good idea of how the humans are affected by the space environment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is funny, it's also very well done. A lot of scenes were done really well and were a pleasure to watch. But it's no mystery why the movie got a lot of good reviews, the lead actress is really a good actress. And the movie just oozes with a good time. The ending could've been better, but then again the movie is short enough to do a few more scenes before it ends.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got this movie for the first time this weekend after a long wait since the last film I watched was back in 2001.   This film had some pretty good scenes as well as some funny scenes.  I did not expect much from this film when I got it.  At first it is an excellent movie that has good acting and a good storyline.  Then halfway through the movie it took a turn to become the worst thing that could have happened in a movie I have seen.  The ending to the film was ridiculous, and I could not take it in at all.  As far as a movie with good acting, I would rank this below one of the worst films I have ever seen, and the worst movie I am going to review.  If the movie is rated at a 6 and you are only going to watch it for the acting, you are in for a very poor experience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was able to finally get this on VHS for some nice, silly fun. I'm not sure if the plot was a tad rushed, but the whole movie had a nice vibe about it. The characters were quirky, and the writing was just silly enough to keep my interest in the whole thing. I'd recommend this to a friend or even to a complete stranger!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of films with strange settings. So I was really surprised by The Last Samurai. It's set in the past, and there are references to Japanese samurai in both the title and the movie itself. There are also some very interesting historical figures that get introduced, and we get to see quite a bit of Japanese culture. As the plot develops, we get a sense of just how the people of that time lived, and I didn't feel like the movie made me feel too far removed from my own world.   In regards to the acting, I really enjoyed a lot of it. It's not that the performances are good or bad, but that the characters and their actions are very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't say much about this one but it was a pretty good movie. I felt it was more entertaining than it was disturbing. I liked how the movie didn't have a very bad ending, I did not see the end of it and I don't really like how they kept the characters apart.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went into this movie not knowing too much about it. So much of what I thought was important is just not there, which is odd, as it would be a lot more difficult to make a good film than to make an awful one. I was surprised at the length, since a lot of the film isn't very compelling or engaging, with all the boring dialog, bland characters, and a plot that's a bit too long, but otherwise very enjoyable. I liked the idea of a space pirate who became a space cop, which sounds a bit silly, but it was done pretty well and makes sense once you get to know him and his crew, but you can't help but feel that he would make a more interesting cop, than a space-pirate. The space battles are well-done and I enjoyed them, especially since it's mostly a space movie, with a decent amount of action and no special effects. The cinematography is good, the soundtrack is good enough, the performances are good enough (except maybe for the actors and some of the dialogue, but that's about it), the writing is decent enough.   I can't really think of much else to say about this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good movie.   I did find the movie a little boring at the beginning, but after the first ten minutes I felt it was really enjoyable.  It's a very nice movie to watch, but I feel a little shortchanged on the ending, which is quite disappointing.  There are no real "bad" or "good" endings in this movie, but instead a satisfying, but simple, ending.  The movie had a beautiful soundtrack, and I enjoyed it a lot.  I liked the voice cast very much, especially the character played by the great, Joan Crawford, and especially the wonderful voice of James Mason, as the villain.  So far I have seen three of John Huston's movies, The Quiet Man, The Man Who Laughs, and The Wild One.  This movie was probably Huston at his best, a very good and very enjoyable movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      A great piece of cinema from the late 70's, with a story that is told very well.   A good blend of comedy, drama, and a little bit of romance.  - January 3, 2014It's all in the name of the music I'm pretty sure this is the worst movie ever made.  This is the third time I've seen this film and I'll never forget it.  It's like watching a bad movie in a bar, or something.  There are several problems with this movie.  First, the special effects are awful.  They are not funny, or bad, they are bad.  The way the lights and shadows change the scenery is a huge waste of money.  Also, the music is horrible.  I couldn't even hear any of the songs through the horrible soundtrack.  As you'll see in the trailer, the main star of this film is the actor who plays a homeless man.  He appears in the film at a party and tells his friends that he's going to be a millionaire.  His friends seem to accept this story, and are just happy he'll be rich.  But as soon as the money starts rolling in, everyone loses their minds and starts stealing from him.  What a loser.  For the next few weeks, the film goes from bad to worse.  And if that's not bad enough, the real villain turns out to be the homeless man's best friend.  How bad can it get?  So what if he is a jerk and gets in fights?  He's just a friend!  But this guy is an asshole, and he makes every other friend in the movie feel horrible.   I don't know about you but I really don't like people who steal from me.  These people just can't seem to get it together.  One friend just keeps asking for his money back, and keeps telling him that he owes him money. But the homeless guy can't get it through his thick head that if he stole the money, he'd be in big trouble with the police and would probably lose his apartment.   He's in for a world of hurt!  The film ends with the homeless friend talking to the police who are interviewing him about stealing from the homeless.  After being told that he has a record for the crime, the police let him go.  Why?  Maybe he has the right to make money for himself, but he

I was impressed by the production value and cinematography and I liked the story and the characters, which is basically that of a normal person who goes into a crazy story.   The characters had a lot of personality and a lot to say, and when they did say it, it was a good dose of reality and humor that made it entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are three kinds of good movies that I see and watch.   I like to be impressed with an actor, especially one who has played a small part in an epic story.  This movie had a small role for me, and I can definitely say it was worth it.  It was a well-constructed, well-acted movie that told a great story and had a terrific ending that made me smile and laugh.  When I saw it again I could not believe I was seeing the end of a story that was the epic, and when I saw that movie again, I was glad I was.  I have never seen a film that felt as real as this movie did, and it was very exciting to watch.

I was expecting a big, fat, boring "Avengers 2" movie, which is what the trailers promised, but the film was a little different in it's tone and approach to the superhero genre. This is more of a "LOST" movie than an "Ace of Aces" movie...but still, it was entertaining.   A fun movie, not a great one, but a fun one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First I should mention that I had not watched the movie since I saw it with my father. I was not at all interested in it at the time but now I would like to see it again because I did not enjoy it all that much. This was not a very good movie and in fact was about a very stupid family who is really bad. So what if they were from the same family, what makes a family in a place like that so bad? Anyway I was sorry to see the family go away because if not for them I could of had a lot more fun with it. The first time I saw this family in the movie was a bit funny because the wife seemed to be in a real hurry and went to her car and drove away. The next time I was there they were on a cruise ship and she was not too interested in what was going on. I would have liked to have seen the family visit a different place and see a more up to date family. This movie is not an action movie which I would not recommend because this is a really bad movie. I guess if you have any money to throw down the screen you will not be disappointed with this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has many wonderful things about it. There is a wonderful chemistry between the main characters. They seem to be like a couple of lost souls searching for a reason for life and purpose. It is funny at times, but it has a profound message and the characters are very well developed. It has a wonderful cast of characters and the story is pretty much a fantasy about a man who lives with a woman, a woman with a magical dog, and an evil witch named Zalahann. When this dog turns on him he finds that his life has been a lie. He is a slave, but there are also times that he is very independent and self reliant. I do not like dogs. The witch Zalhann is a little odd, but I would say the movie had a nice twist. I will say that the only drawback is that the cast is pretty underdeveloped and most of the movies main characters are only there to be adorable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love sci-fi films. It's so easy to be influenced by them. It is like a natural thing to do. I thought about what would make a good sci- fi movie for a long time. Then I saw it. The story is pretty good and is worth watching. If you don't mind the film being a little more childish and cheesy than usual, then this is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like action, don't pass this one by.   The first time you saw this one, I thought it was kind of goofy and had some good action sequences.  The main problem is the plot.  It's about a guy with a gun who finds a lady in the desert and they fight a war.  Some people will like this and some won't.  There's a pretty good ending but I wouldn't recommend watching it for those who just love action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I want to say that I love the fact that it was shot in 4K for the first time.  It took the film almost as long to shoot in 4:3 as it did in 16:9.  A real shame that the film is almost in a frame by frame, but you are only seeing what the camera shows you.  The cinematography is great with some great locations.  For a movie made in just over 5 days, there was a great balance in editing of the story.  This is a very well made movie that will hopefully be on the list of the best movies of 2017.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to see this movie, and it made me cry.   This movie is a must see.  They have a little love story, but it is a sad and sad love story.  The way it ends is a horrible way to end a love story (I would have liked it to be more about the characters, and the relationship between the two people.  I hope they try to make a movie about the relationship again sometime, because it was one of the most emotional films I have seen recently.  If you are a lover of movies with a love theme, this is a wonderful film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an entertaining story told in the style of an American western. It's a good story, and the acting is great. The story was told well with a lot of humor in it.   The music was a little out of place but it was really fun to listen to.  I recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing I can tell you about this movie is that you cannot put it down, and you won't forget this movie either. The movie doesn't go the easy route, but if you are a fan of horror, a comedy, or both, you will enjoy this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, but the story, the acting, the music... it's just... so... damn... cool.   In the story you've got a woman who's going to be the next Mrs. Jones who's pregnant with a son named Jack (or as the script puts it, "Ponyboy") who comes from a family of wealthy people and a great grandmother (a.k.a the "Dinosaur Lady") who is "crazy." This may sound like the type of movie a crazy old woman should have.  However, things turn out to be very different when Jack is born.  In this particular family they are all very good people and all think that they are doing right by Jack and they are very concerned for his well-being. But after a certain time there is a turning point and one of the old ladies decides to have a very unusual baby.  It is the first time in the family's history that the daughter was conceived through insemination and there is some interesting changes.  There is a man named Joe and his wife and kids, a nice man named Daphne who is quite "normal," and an old lady named Nancy who is very religious, very devoted to her faith, and who is a devout Catholic.  At this time in history Nancy is not married to Joe, but in fact she is already married.  As I said, things are very different.  The first thing she does when she hears that her daughter is conceived inseminated is send a note to her sister-in-law and her father to come down to the cottage, and she tells the children about the whole thing, but they really don't get what is happening.  Nancy does not have the traditional American family life that most Americans are used to.  First of all, she is not a child, and so she is a full-time housewife in a small, one-story home that looks like the sort of place that is just up the road from the "Cake Batteries" supermarket in Southie.  For reasons I do not know, I love this home.  Next, there is no car, no radio, no television and no TV set.  She never has a day off.  Then when she has babies, her children are always with her at all times except in the morning and lunch time.  Her husband doesn't stay home either, he
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friend and I went to a big movie theater and there was a bunch of kids. One guy was really cute with a great big smile and really nice personality.   He asked the kids where they all lived so he could go see them.  This guy went up to a bunch and started yelling at a girl. She then grabbed his arm and the guy grabbed her arm back and then she started to hit him and yelled. The kids started screaming at the guy and a couple of other kids grabbed the other kids.  A big guy in a suit came up and kicked the other guy and then threw some stuff in a kid's face.  One girl had been in a fight earlier and he threw some water on her. She had black eyes and was crying and was asking for her mommy to come get her.  I saw a few kids who didn't get along get along and then one kid had a problem and the big guy got his son's attention.  The kids were yelling at each other and eventually they did get along.  Then a guy came over with his big kid and he asked if there was anyone that didn't like kids. The kid gave the guy his name and he said hello. The boy looked like he was 7 years old and looked really good for a boy in his first movie.  After he left the guy told the kid that his name was Daniel and he was Daniel from Wisconsin.  And then he showed me his little brother who looked like a little boy.  We all sat in silence and waited to see what was going to happen. I had forgotten about the little boy when I saw him. I thought he was going down a dark hallway with all those kids that were screaming. He took a bunch with him into the next room and told a couple to leave. He threw one kid against a wall and told him to get out. Then he asked the kid what he did and the kid said he was a movie buff.  It seemed like this little boy was going a really, really long way and there were no lights to see him.  He didn't look angry but he sure wasn't smiling.  When I got back to my seat I had to wait about five minutes until the movie started.  My husband and I both loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people complain about the lack of screen time given to the female leads (both main and supporting), so if this review annoys you I don't blame you. But the movie is still good. The story of the film follows the story of two high school students, who have just moved in together. They are both of them shy but the girls are so beautiful that I donít know if they can resist each other. After all, their life just happened to be living together and they are pretty much the only guys in the school. There is one girl who likes the girls and wants them to be together, but the guys arenít interested in her. One day the two girls are forced to move to another neighborhood because the boys will be having a party and some of the girls wanted to go to the party. The boys go to another house and the girls go to one house, but when they arrive there is no music so the two guys are having a sleep over. At first the two young women get along great and are able to help each other out. But things quickly start to fall apart and the men arení t able to have a good time and end up fighting. When they are able see each other again they are both sad because theyíre not able to do anything. They doní t know what to do, and the movie ends on a sad note.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at the cinema with a bunch of friends one evening and we all decided to watch this movie. There was a long line at the door of the cinema and we saw the film and it did not disappoint.  The story is about a boy named Jack who wants to be a superhero. His parents hate him because they say that he is'stupid' and he only thinks of doing petty crimes for money. But when he finds a dead guy he realizes that he has a chance to be super-villain.    This movie is a very good one and if you want a good superhero story this is a great one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last of the big action films of the 80s.   It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger.  This is the movie of a great movie star.  Schwarzenegger does a pretty good job as well.  There's a lot of funny scenes, and a lot more action than you would expect from a movie like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are lots of reviews of the movie about the war on drugs, about the money in the prisons and the corruption of the system. But I was not there and I did not witness these things. I only got a glimpse of them. Thats why I wanted to tell you about a film I was lucky to see. A film which is really good. I think I should watch the whole movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went into this movie thinking it was going to be a mediocre thriller with a few plot twists. The twist actually is more exciting than I thought. I love the suspense of the movie. This movie is fun to watch!   (reviewed the day of release)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw The Shawshank Redemption (and I'm not alone in this assessment) a couple of weeks ago and I'm now going to watch the third time.   This movie has been praised by critics and fans alike and I would have to say that it certainly is a better movie than any of those.  The story is told from three different points of view. Each of these characters is trying to accomplish what they believe is their duty as a correctional officer.    They have come to this state because they believe that they are at a crossroads in their lives.  I have no doubt that this is a very well made movie with some great acting and a really interesting plotline.  There is some action in the movie but I don't think that it's over the top.  And if you like action movies you will probably love this.  I think that this movie is an enjoyable movie and I look forward to seeing it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most underrated movies I have ever seen.   Its a film about a man who has a special skill and a man and his dog who want a new toy to play with when the guy who runs the local toy store closes up shop.  The guys think they can use the new toy but they end up using it to mess with the guy and his man dog.  They mess with his car, his house, his business and the guy's wife.  He has a son that doesn't like his father at all but he does have a lot of friends.  After some messing around they get a little greedy and mess up the guy again.  Then the guy does something stupid and ends up messing up the man's house and the dog too.  Things get really out of hand and the guys get thrown in jail.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the title says, the movie is a good action movie.   It's definitely a better version of the "The Killer Shrew" series than it is a remake or sequel.  But the plot is a little odd and is too bad it isn't done with a lot more humor and energy.  That's the last thing you expect from a movie about a deadly killer.  If you don't like the ending, you might like the beginning.  A lot of the scenes are funny but they are very poorly acted, and the characters are mostly one-note stereotypes.  It was fun to watch but I don't think you'll want to watch it again because it was a waste of time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I was a little disappointed at first with this movie. I was hoping to get a little action and fight scenes that would make the movie worth seeing. I got the movie but I would not recommend this to others as I never really got into the story. I loved the fighting in the movie and I was really enjoying it. I hope I will see this movie at a later date.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie made me laugh and I liked it.   The plot is kinda confusing at first, but after the first five minutes, I knew I was watching something that was going to be funny.  What you should know before watching:  This is a comedy-drama with lots of comedy and a plot that is not bad, although not to my liking.  The only problem is the ending, which made me hate the movie a little.  If you like funny movies, then this is for you.  There is nothing wrong with this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never been one to watch a lot of romantic comedies.  I love rom coms but I was never a big fan of romcom comedies,  at times I find them annoying  at others I really like them.   It's a very funny, sweet and funny romcom/comedy/drama about a college student that's a single dad raising a kid.  It follows a typical college life that goes awry at times and at other times has a lot to say about how family can sometimes go wrong.  Like I said I'm a fan of the romcom genre and this one is a great romcom. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (the movie was very well acted, the characters are really quite interesting, the story is a story of a family and their relationship, it's a very good movie) (the film was good, but the first part of it was slow and it's boring to watch, but later the film gets better and better, the plot is interesting and the characters were very interesting, however, there was not much action in it, i like that).
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen the original film version of this movie a few years back. I have to say, it's definitely my favorite vampire film to date. I like the twist ending though. It works very well.    The original film was a pretty decent vampire film with decent acting from all involved.  The Original Film:  The new cut of the film does a lot of things to the original. It adds more blood and gore to the film. There are some new scenes that were not present in the original that didn't make the movie work, but I think the director of the movie should have kept those scenes in the film because they did nothing to enhance the film and they did add to the vampire movie. There were also some new actors in the movie. They were all done very well, and they added to the movie in different ways. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film about a young man's journey to become a priest...a film which has something of a message about how a good father can be...and how his children can be the best of friends, too.   This is a very strong film.  In a very good way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A bit like the "Gravity" (which, by the way, is really good and is a huge improvement over the original), this one has a lot of things going for it, and even with all the great acting, there are a few things that are really hard to take. That's not an attack on these actors. They are great. This is simply saying that I think that for a film that has so many people in it, there is one really great scene that is done extremely well, but the other scenes all look so ordinary and not much of a step above most other films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a group of people (dressed up in silly costumes) that have to try and beat a mysterious group of assassins. I don't know what it is about this movie that has people running around and being "funny". It is one of those films that is really, really funny and really, actually kind of hard to watch. I know a lot of people love these type of comedies but for the most part these are really bad comedies. I guess this was a movie from the 1980's where the actors and crew didn't really know what to do. I really loved the characters in this movie. I loved the way it made me laugh. It is a funny movie for sure and I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you like bad movies I would recommend this movie to you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was very enjoyable and I loved the idea of a world where the evil and the good are in a war for supremacy. I was a bit disappointed in the fact that one of the characters didn't get enough screen time and had very little to do. There were some interesting moments when the characters had to make a choice and I liked the look of the car.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really good.   The film is about a father who loves his wife very much. His only son has a bad attitude and he thinks that he is more important then the father.  However the father is still a very caring man.  He tries to help his son and teach him what he should be doing with his life.  But the son has lost a lot of his love for his mother and will never love his father again.  The father's heart breaking story.  I enjoyed the story very much and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie with my family, my dad is the main character, the others are the supporting characters and the main love interest.   My dad had a drinking problem in the 80s, after a lot of success, he has a drink problem again in the 90s, the rest of the movie is a fun time.  For a man who has drank to the point of blindness the film had a lot to offer,  his character is a good guy.  My wife and I laughed alot, my son is going to love this movie.  Thank you for making a good film for the fans of John Wayne.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is well made, with a good story, decent acting and some nice action scenes, but it is still a bit too slow and predictable.   It is also pretty easy to predict which character will die next, so it is not really a mystery. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is fantastic. The director did a wonderful job. This movie has lots of blood and violence. But I like it. It is an epic film.

It is a great movie and it will make you want to go to the theater every time you see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all it's a great movie because you will not get bored with it, although it is not like other gangster movies (like the ones from the 70's). The script and the production values are great. The actors portray their role well, so it is worth seeing it. It is not a movie to watch all the time and it's good to watch a good crime movie with your family.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of The Karate Kid. The character designs are very appealing (like many other characters in the movie) and the plot is great. The plot is just what you'd expect from a movie of this type. You have to learn Karate to beat up people that you hate. The fight choreography is just wonderful and it never fails to amuse. The Karatedoo (the martial arts equivalent of a kick-ass kick-some-ass) that Mr. Miyagi uses is just... fantastic. If I had any nit-picks, it would be that Mr Miyagi gets a little overzealous in a few scenes and in a couple of scenes in particular (the fights against the baddies in the beginning and the final battle against Goro) the action gets a bit too crazy. However, the fights are so well choreographed and it's really impressive how the movie never looks bad.   This movie is really good and it is one of those films that will probably last you a good long time. It's an exciting, well-made action flick that will get your heart pumping.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is simple, yet really compelling. The movie is a remake of a TV series called " The Big Story ", a "60's" version of the " Twilight Zone ". The plot revolves around a small girl named Lola and her little brother, named Alex. They both have very interesting stories, and there are no real villains here. The best part of the movie is the little twist. I think that one of the reasons this movie is enjoyable is because it's so much like "Twilight Zone", which itself is really enjoyable.   There are plenty of creepy little moments, which you really shouldn't skip. The music is also well done, and the movie really is a good one. I recommend this movie to any fans of "Twin Peaks" or the "Twist & Shout" series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this movie had the potential to be good, and a good character drama in a fantastic world. However, the film itself suffers from some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie. It is literally a film of two actors with a couple of bad lines each, and none of them are funny. I do not blame the actors who are in it, I think the actors need to get a different type of roles, because it's not the type of role that can be good acting. So when you see a movie with bad acting, it's usually a good bad movie, and this movie just makes you feel bad about yourself for watching it, and it makes you wonder how anyone can watch a movie like this and not be depressed about it. This was my first movie to get me in a bad mood the whole night, so I don't think I'll be watching any of these movies for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie about a girl who becomes a ninja and the guy who becomes an idol.     The movie is about the rivalry between a karate master and a kobold named Kuribayashi, and the battle between Kuribeyashi and a ninja named Chino, and how it leads to an ending which is really something, as far as karate movies go. I think it has been about a year since I saw it, but I liked it and I am glad it is still around.  The music was really good, and I liked how the ending was really different from what the movie started with. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny and heartfelt comedy about a woman who loves dogs, one that is about as endearing as they come.   While it is true that the movie is full of cute and endearing little characters, it is also the best of the bunch, as it touches upon the very difficult subject of love and its many complexities.  It is the story of the character called 'Willy' who is an elderly, yet still loveable dog.  For some reason he is drawn to his owner's neighbor, the rather unattractive and rather creepy old woman who runs the dog shop. The film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the book by L.P. Hart and contains some clever one-liners and witty dialogue.  At times this feels like a little bit of a 'campy' comedy, at other times like a good love story that has a certain heart of gold buried within its bones.  And as much as I loved the characters, I couldn't help but feel like it was a little too short.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.   If you are looking for a horror movie with great writing and sound you can't go wrong.  Like the title says this movie is very suspenseful and a little bit disturbing but in the end it really is a nice movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked it. The movie's title is from the song "I Know Where I'm Going" by a woman from The Village People who sang in the movie and is featured in the trailer. I think she would've made an awesome lead.   There's a good cast of characters, though not the most likable ones. But, there is an element of humor to them that's nice to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The last thing the film tries to do is explain what happened before the film. What it does do well is set up a setting that is at least a little plausible. The only thing the viewer needs to be aware of is the fact that it is a fictional account of events that actually took place in a very real and violent context. What is interesting is that despite this a great deal is left unexplained and there are a great number of unanswered questions. I feel that the film does a fine job at handling this situation. It is also important to stress that it does not pretend to be an accurate account of what really happened. The film is a wonderful combination of action, fantasy, thriller and horror. It would be difficult to recommend it to a complete stranger."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is based on a popular novel by William Faulkner. This was made by a group of British people and it's a funny movie, but it doesn't have much of a story to it. The movie starts with an old man who is in jail. He has lived a hard life and has become very bitter about things that he had to deal with, and about things he had no control over. He is released from jail and he is angry, angry, and he decides to murder his wife and children. In fact, he wants to murder everyone in the town, except for his son, who he is trying to get back, and who has become a real problem in his life. But he has a new friend in the jail, a woman named Anna who has a bit of a reputation for being a very strong woman. Her husband has been killed, and she is on her own, so she has been taking care of herself. The wife and the kids go to the local bar, where a new girl has been talking to him. He's a nice guy, but he's got a nasty, foul mouth, which is always a problem for women. He wants to talk to her about his plans to kill everyone in town, which he believes will solve all their problems. The new girl says he is crazy, but the old man doesn't buy it. So he sets out to find the family and kill them all. It turns out, it is all very confusing for the old guy. He sees the family, but they are all very different people and his son is a very different person. He can't even get a name for him. Then he sees a man at a funeral and he has some interesting things to say about the old lady. The old guy is very frustrated. He doesn't know what to do about the new girl. Then a local cop, a guy named Bob, starts to talk him into doing his job. Then the whole thing comes together. It is a great movie and an interesting one. You will have to give it a watch if you like movies like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that has many different moments that you will love or will hate but I can say that for the most part it works.   I was not a fan of the first 3 movies so I never really gave this one a chance.  I'm not sure what I expected from this movie but it did not disappoint.  For those of you who have seen the original series you should know what to expect.  There is a large, bad looking town, a man who works at a gas station runs a garage, a woman who runs a convenience store, an elderly couple that take care of a sick son and a young girl who runs the school.  This town is very violent and they are constantly fighting.  They are all different and have a very sad story to tell.  The characters were all very realistic.  One guy has an overactive imagination which makes him a trouble maker, another is a girl who takes care of the elderly couple who have no one else to take care off and a girl is a schoolteacher.  All the characters have their quirks and all have their flaws.  While this film is not the best it did what it needed to do.  It was a very violent movie with no real point.  My favorite thing about this movie is when a gang of drug dealers attack a woman that is trying to sell some food.  When she runs and hides in a building they chase after her and they beat her, steal her purse and then shoot up the building.  Another thing that I liked about this was when the main character goes into a fight with a gang.  He goes into the fight and then runs out to his car and when the gang sees him running away they go after him and kill him.  Now I have no problem with the idea of a kid running away from his gang but then you make the guy go into the building that the gang has surrounded.  Also, the movie was a bit slow at times.  But I can't say that there was a flaw in this movie because it was a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. Not a particularly "good" movie per se, but I liked it very much. The story is a little dry, but the story is the only thing I liked about it. As with any good sci-fi movie, it doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, but instead takes a few simple concepts and builds on them. It's like a really good soap opera with a lot of gore and violence and lots of laughs and drama and characters I care about. I don't think it is the best movie I've ever seen, but it's one of the best movies that I've really seen in awhile.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great example of a great actor who knows exactly what he is doing.   He knows exactly when to take his scenes seriously and when to play silly and make you laugh.  It is very good at both.  The music is good.  My favorite actor has to be Mr. John Wayne who played the sheriff in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a solid film, well paced and well acted, well acted by Tom Hanks, who always does a fine job in any role he's given. The film also has the pleasure of including a nice bit of humor in the form of a guy who can't pronounce the word "crap" correctly.   The film makes a fair case for what it is, a comedy, the kind of comedies that don't come along very often. The cast is also very funny, the most hilarious being a woman who thinks she's a "rock star", a guy that doesn't believe in anything and one of the most memorable cameos ever, and of course, a very funny Tom Hank, although the "I'm a real tough guy, I'm not like the guy in that one" line is pretty lame.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie that takes place in a futuristic setting, the film has an old school feel about it. The movie revolves around a group of friends that are having a party at their old house. The house has been abandoned for many years, the only furniture left is the sofa and the armoire which have a few scattered photos of people they used to know. One day they all go for a ride in a UFO they found. However, something goes wrong and a giant face-like man comes down the staircase with a knife and begins attacking the passengers on board.   He kills most of them, but only one survives. That person is a young girl named Sara and she runs around trying to get the man off of her. Once she gets him the knife has the power to kill anyone but Sara. She then falls from the UFO as the man comes back down and is about to kill her again, when she sees a small boy fall from a balloon. She climbs back up and gets the boy, who turns out to be an alien that has just been turned.  After being turned Sara falls in love with the alien and decides to stay with him.  However, he also loves Sara and the alien, and their relationship is tested at every step of the way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie at the first night at the new, refurbished BFI. I knew I would be watching a new release when I walked in and saw that it was a re-release of a classic movie. The movie itself was good. I thought that was all that was needed. Well, the movie was not great. The ending felt rushed and the ending could have been better. But I like a good comedy, and the characters were all interesting and I enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't had to do a day job at the hospital the movie would have been worth seeing, but with my job it was impossible to sit through. The plotline was good and the movie itself not so bad. I would recommend this movie for a laugh, and maybe to watch with your spouse or if you have someone in the house who is funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good sequel.   There is so much more to the story.  The characters are very real, and you can see them struggling.  I would recommend the movie to all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been waiting a long time for a sequel to this movie, after all the fanfic that has been posted on a forum about this film.   This was my first movie that I had watched in the theatre with a bunch of friends, and the movie has all the elements that a good sci-fi movie should have.  When this movie starts, the film starts off very slow and you wonder what will happen in this movie.  The movie starts off with a bang and then slowly it builds it's excitement.  I do think that the movie does get better with each time you watch it.  There are some great shots in this film, especially in the spaceship.  Also, it is nice to see an alien (alien being a big plus in my book).    Overall, I think this is a great movie. If you like Star Trek: The Next Generation, or have watched any of the Star Trek movies (they are not the same) then you will love this movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that had an excellent performance from Ben Stiller, which was more like a parody of a movie starring Stiller and the cast from Will & Grace.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw "The Road" last night at a movie theater and I loved it. If you enjoy horror films of the late 60's and early 70's, check this one out.   This film is about a guy named Joe, who is killed in a motorcycle accident in his 20's by a young kid (played by the great Jeff Corey) and he is never seen again. He's still dead a long time and a woman who lives alone in a cave and has a mysterious obsession with finding him. As she digs deeper into his death her story becomes more interesting and her own secrets are revealed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed The Book Thief   and recommend it to everyone. It's a fast paced, fun adventure movie that's packed with a lot of comedy and is great fun for all ages. The Book-Thief is a fun, action-packed romp with a great plot. I'd like to see it come out sooner than later. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So far I'm really liking this movie. The way it is being done feels more like a TV movie and less like a feature length movie. That said, it's still a really good movie. There are some cool scenes and it's great seeing those characters get a bit more of a character.   "Don't go! Don't go!"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a young boy named James who has a brain tumor but is a genius at maths. He is on the brink of losing the use of his right arm and the help of his friends to help him make it. It was the most beautiful, beautiful movie I have ever seen. It's not the most sophisticated, it's just beautifully made. And you have to be in your right mind to get it.   "This is a beautiful film." -Mia Farrow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great film.     The plot is very simple:  Two cops (Jim and Jim's son Jim) catch a guy (John Dolph) who is taking money from the rich, giving it to the poor, and getting away with it.  One of these cops, Jim, is a little bit too quick to believe that the police are in fact all crooks. Â Then Jim is killed by the guy and it turns out the whole story is a lie, Jim is really the son of Jim, and the whole scheme was set up by a guy named John Dolph.     So the cop/cop killer, John Dolf, has been on the run, trying to get to a big city. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about an astronaut, named Paul Weyland (played by Brad Pitt) who is on a mission to find a colony to send to Mars. He is going to get himself a wife and have children, and his mission is to get a group of kids to survive on Mars, and to find out why they are so angry with Earth. The movie follows him on the mission.   I have heard that the movie looks like the first movie (from the original trilogy), which I find strange. I have not seen any of the original movies, but I have seen the movies in the 1980s. The first movie is an excellent movie. I wish I could see the movie again, so I could like it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am pretty sure this is the best zombie movie I've seen this year so far.   It does the job it needs to.  It has a good time making you watch this movie with a bunch of zombie lovers.  The thing that impressed me the most with this movie was that the plot was not overbearing like some other movies that I've watched.  And I mean that in a good way.  There was a sense of humor that made this movie fun.  This movie had the most zombie lovers I've ever seen in one movie.  That was something I was happy about.  But I do think that I'm going to see this movie several more times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really didn't expect much from the first movie that I saw. I had seen a trailer online that was so bad that I didn't even pay attention, but it was a good one. I have always loved zombies so I watched it with a huge dose of anticipation. As a result, I am a big fan of zombies and have watched many of them. This movie is just another good one to add to the zombie movie collection.   Like many other reviews have said, this is an interesting movie. It is the best zombie movie I've seen. I thought it was hilarious. I loved it!   This is the first Zombie movie that i've seen that has not one bad scene and it is always entertaining. I could go on and on about the zombies, but I'm just going to let this one speak for itself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found myself quite thoroughly impressed by a film about a group of misfits who travel to an unknown land. Although I was expecting a pretty stereotypical story, I didn't expect the quality of the filmmaking to be up to that standard. This is a very enjoyable film with some decent special effects. I will say that it's a little slow at the beginning, but then you realize what this is: a bunch of teenagers with a bunch more misfits (and I do mean misfits) who all travel together. The story has some humorous moments and I liked the "villains" they all were - the way they came across made me laugh a couple times and I didn not like the way the lead character was written as a "fag" but that can be forgiven by the film being so good.   Another thing I liked was the way all of the boys interacted together as they traveled and I think the fact that some of the girls had girlfriends made up for that - a nice change from your usual chick flicks    A real eye-opener for me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this I had mixed feelings about it. I really liked it, not the type of movie I'd see every once in a while. It was well acted, well acted and well thought out. The cinematography was great and the special effects were good but not great. The acting was good, well done. The movie had a nice story, the ending was good and the ending would probably get a thumbs up from me but I thought the whole movie was a little underwhelming. The ending was a good one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is all about a beautiful and mysterious and dark fairy-tale with a wonderful soundtrack, and this movie should not be missed by anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - This was a great movie! The whole movie was really great!   This movie is a great thriller about the evil of the cult. It is really great. The movie was great, but i felt like it was a little slow in places. The camera was good too, but it was missing too many moments and it was hard to get used to seeing it like that. But it was still a great story, great acting and good music. The ending was very strong and it made a nice impact.   - This was great movie, really good acting and the story was really good, but there were some scenes that were a little too slow in the movie, and there were also a few scenes that had no effect.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, I want to say that this is a movie which I found to be a real "hoot" to watch. The special effects, the special score, the great action and the wonderful performance by Tom Arnold (I don't know who he is) - this movie will leave you with many memories. Also, for some odd reason the music that accompanied the movie was a little too low - which made me feel that the movie could have been played a bit faster - but it was never boring, the action was really good, and Tom Arnold is really a great actor who was able to make a character with great depth and a very good sense of humor.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie and love watching it. I love the art direction and the character designs especially for the most part they are cute and cute and adorable. The main villain is a cool and cool antagonist and he does not come off as a bad guy at all, it's more of a he's a cool bad guy and the evil things he does is pretty cute in my opinion but that does not mean the movie is bad! I like the story in this movie.   The villain is kind of a loser but it's okay cause he is also kind of cute and it's cool! The villain and his evil plan of what he wants to do is pretty funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Last Boy Scout" is a pretty good film.   The story, which follows a boy scout named Danny, who has recently left his hometown, New York City, has a rather good plot.  It was pretty well done and the ending was well done as well.  The acting was all right, as was the singing, although the singing was a little off putting.  There were some funny moments and I laughed a little, although not too much.  A few other things were mentioned.  I think "The Boy Scouts" would be a good film for a young person or a kid, who is not too bright.  If you are a child, then "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is probably a better movie.  But, if you are too old, then it is probably better to start with "The Day the Earth Stood Still".  This is a good, fun film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the same as other movies like it where they show a lot of the violence and the things that happened in the movie. I think it was a movie about life and being alive. A good movie, but not the best, it had its moments in the middle of the movie but the end was way to long.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a very interesting and original movie that was quite entertaining.   You have to watch this movie from beginning to end, because it is an adventure in a kind of "The Hobbit" which is really good.  This movie is not suitable for young children, and for adults only, because this movie is a bit dark and mature.  I found it entertaining and I'm going to watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at a summer camp in high school. I am a big fan of The Muppets.   There are a few great things about this movie. I really liked that the Muppet performers got in the movie as background extras.  They did the best they could and I liked the acting by Jerry Nelson and Kermit.  The singing and dancing by the Muppeteers was great. The acting by Kermit was really good.  It was a little funny to see Muppa Kermit and The Muppet Puppeteer as enemies. I wish they would get together again and do a show together.  I love the scenes of the Munchkin Village in the Mumbo Jumbo factory.  This was a very good movie that was fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It was very well done, and had a good, but somewhat generic and unrealistic feel about it. It is very short, but I could really relate to a lot of the main characters and their situations.   My favorite character was the one that I loved the most: the female version of the antagonist of the movie was awesome!   Overall, this was a fun movie, with a decent story and good acting (especially the male cast).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the idea and it's a pretty cool premise, but I was a little disappointed the first two times I watched it. The first time it was a bit clunky, with the way they pulled the story together and made the ending seem like it was planned out. And the second time I was about to say to myself "Well, this is about the worst movie I've seen all year," but I really enjoyed it. It's just so much fun! I didn't like the ending though, and I'm glad it was over.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this one in the theater a couple of times as well as to keep up with the story line. It's a great story line that has the action scenes and the romance scenes but the way it's written makes it very easy to follow.   It's not the most original story line to tell but it does what it sets out to do and makes it worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had not heard of the film  The Boy in the Plastic Bubble before. I'm a fan of the cartoon that ran on ABC during the late 90's/early 2000's. It seemed like a good time, though it didn't always stay that way.   The Boy In The Plastic Bubble  is about a boy who gets his head stuck in a plastic bubble and discovers that he has been kidnapped. This sounds like a pretty standard story, but that's not what makes this movie a good one. I can't tell you how many times I was really interested in what the boy was going to do in the next hour or two. When he eventually manages to get out, it was a surprise. I never would have guessed that he would get his head out.  This is a good cartoon, a good film with a good ending.  It's a good reminder to me that there are more than one way to tell a story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched the film, and it was a very good film, with a great storyline. I was not sure why we are seeing a story about a woman who was a thief and a killer. There was very little to look at, and I thought it was really hard to get a feel for the world and the characters. That was until she met a guy and fell in love. I think that the actor was good, and he was able to keep a straight face. I would give it 3 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good. The only real problem is that there were several different endings that the director wanted to see and so his ending was very unsatisfying.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For whatever reason, I've been looking forward to this one. This is my first go at a good zombie movie (I've never really liked them all that much). What I like about this one is that, while the movie is not scary (at least not all the way through), it is more of a mystery. As I mentioned, there isn't much violence, but there are some blood splatters and the film's style (and theme) are pretty creepy.   This is a great movie, if you like the macabre, or if you have a taste for the undead.  "There is no cure for the common cold."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So far so good.       I was very impressed by the special effects and overall movie.  When the credits started rolling I was really surprised because the movie really had a good tone.  The plot was good and so was the movie. The action scenes were really fun.   The acting was good, the plot was clever.    When they go to visit the mother of the bride of the groom the father tells them about his son's dream which was really good.    I really liked the ending where they go back to their time when they lived with the father.  My biggest complaints were the fact that they were not given enough time to explain about the plot and the fact they only went to visit one person.  I do like the fact the movie had good special effects but maybe there should have been a little more time on the plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a solid movie. The story of two friends who get to spend time together while their parents go to bed is a nice start to the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a great movie. A little slow in the beginning but then it started moving along at a decent pace. The plot, although not well thought out was interesting. I think it was supposed to be a short film but there was too much action in it and we were waiting for a big battle to occur. I thought the ending was very nice. If I had seen this at a young age I may have liked it even more. A good little film to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I liked this movie a lot more than I expected to. The story of the film revolves around a young black man who is a young drug addict who is living with his mother. He takes advantage of his mother's naivette and naivety in his pursuit of a "better life". The story does not revolve around him much as he is never the lead character and he is not a really good kid. The only good parts about the movie are the acting of the actors and the music. The movie itself isn't too bad, but there is a problem with the way the story is told. It would have been better if the story had a bit more focus in it. It doesn't have the same tension as most movies, and there is no real tension in the movie. You would never see a guy like this hanging around in the streets. The drug problem and the police problems seems to take up most of the movie's screen time. The way it ends is really disappointing, but the ending is better than the rest of the movies I've seen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My name is Kevin, I'm 28 years old and from the UK. I am an actor for television but my main job is to be a dad. I live in America with my wife and my son. We have two little boys and when we have the kids over for Christmas my wife wants to know if we can make some extra money and we decide to go to the movie theater to see The Santa Clause 2 on Christmas day. I have never seen the movie before but I'm sure I'll be quite pleased.   It was a Christmas movie! We all had a great time. My wife bought my son a hotdog and he wanted to eat it! That was great. There was a lot of singing. We loved the songs. We laughed a lot and it was fun. I really like the voice of Fred Astaire and it made the movie a lot more fun!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie. I'm sure you're all wondering what's so special about this movie. Well, it's a great sci-fi flick. It's got an action packed pace. It has a great script and is very well done. It doesn't have any stupid dialogue, and most of the time, it has a lot more action than it needs to. It also has one of the greatest sci- fi sound effects I have ever heard. This movie is great. I would love to see a followup to this movie so we can see how the technology develops. But until then, it is definitely a must watch movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A man on a quest for his missing family members.   For a movie that has so many aspects to it, this one has a lot of story development to it.  When I first watched this, I felt as if I was reading a book (though it had no real plot).  There is a very strong and powerful presence that this movie has, and it's very well done in terms of acting, directing, writing, and music.  This movie can hold your attention in a bad mood for hours.  I enjoyed it to the point where I was looking forward to the next episode.  While the story might not be as deep as some others, there is a lot to enjoy here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is really interesting and a lot of laughs. It was good to see that the action in this movie was really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It took me a while to watch this, but it was well worth it!   This is a remake of a movie from the early 70's. It's a great story about a group of friends in the 1950's who make a big, stupid mistake.   So why do you think I didn't think much about this one until I watched the trailer?   The story is pretty basic, except for the fact that the girl is really good-looking and the guys are stupid.  For me, the most obvious difference between this and the original is that the story is really interesting and funny.  It also is a pretty good flick.  I was able to see a bit of the film before I finally finished it, and it had an interesting mix of comedy and drama. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a lot of fun.   It reminds me a lot  of the old timey adventure movies  I loved back in my  early 20's when I saw the movie on TV.  And, it's good!!! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So far this is one of my favorite movies about a man in a hurry.   The film is pretty short, but it has good dialogue, good pacing, good story, and an interesting guy at the center of the whole thing.  It's also got some really good music.  The whole movie is set in this place in the mountains, in a lodge.  There's an old man who lives there with his wife and a couple of kids.  He can't do much in the way of cooking, because his wife is an artist and his kids are very artistic.  After he is killed by an avalanche, the wife, the artist, and his daughter take off for the coast.  When they come down here, they find a whole different world.  This place is a dream, filled with beautiful women, and old men who look like they'd be happier in another time and place.  They all want to stay in this dream, and so they all do.  But something has happened to the old man.  Before he died, he had written some sort of love letter to a beautiful young woman named Jenny.  Somehow, she's returned here.  She wants to know what he was doing on the mountain that day.  So they have an intense conversation.  And then she returns home, alone.  Jenny has had a difficult life and doesn't really know anything about love.  As they get to know each other, they begin to fall in love.     I really liked this movie.  I mean, it's an absolutely beautiful and romantic film.  At times, it seemed a bit too real, but when they're all back together and Jenny is at her wit's end, it brings a great sadness to the whole film.   If you can find this film, and the soundtrack is good enough to make you want to dance to it, you've got a movie that will make you smile.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are so many films that have a good screenplay and good directing, but so many that don't, and I am thankful that this is one of the latter.   This is about a group of people who all have a problem with each other, and it starts out in a rather innocuous fashion. One of the guys wants to become a cowboy, but his friend is a hippie, and the hippie is so angry about the whole thing that he kills his friend by running him over with his motorcycle. This is the only time in the film that I found it too serious, and that was the only other time in my life I ever found this film too serious. It is a great film, and if you don't see it, you will never see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is okay. It's a movie about a girl named Jett who is sent to a school for witches by her parents to avoid being sent to some more traditional place. Her parents send her to a place where there are no adults, and Jett has to find her place there. But as she finds her place and comes to terms with being a witch, she finds herself falling in love with the main guy (a guy who seems to love her, but still, he's a guy... who looks like an ugly, old, balding man). The movie isn't really good. There is a lot of singing and dancing and the movie's animation is actually pretty decent. And it's a pretty funny movie as well. It isn't quite a hit in the same way the others are, but it's not really bad either.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's great.   I've always been a fan of films that are gritty and dark and don't make a big deal of being gritty and a dark film.  I always say that if you ever see a film like this and it makes you feel like you've seen a lot of films like this then you probably haven't.  The characters all have their faults but they are all sympathetic.  Even the villains are sympathetic. It's a great film that makes you think and feels very dark and gritty and gritty.  It would probably be better without the soundtrack.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not bad and it's a good action movie.   The cast is amazing and they get a lot of screen time.  In all honesty, the story is a little silly. It's a sequel to the first film in the series and it follows some other people.  There are a few other good action movies but this one is the best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of things I like about this movie. I liked how it was based on a real case of rape by a cop, but with all of the real life details, it was a pretty realistic depiction. I enjoyed the main girl, who was a tough and tough-minded woman, with the occasional bit of romance thrown in here and there. I also liked the scenes with the two girls that were very innocent and sweet in their innocence. It made me laugh a bit when the detective kept asking them what they want to do when they get older. I was impressed with the fact that the detective was still just a kid at the time, and even though he didn't seem like he was that much older, he had a lot more experience at age 13 than he did at age 11! Overall, this was a good film, but there were some things I found to be a little odd.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a nice little short horror movie. You get a little bit of everything you could hope for.   The story has some very nice scenes, and there's a great deal of creepiness as well.  The camera work in this movie is really nice, too.  This movie is just a really cool little horror movie, and you should definitely take a look at it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good story, but a very bad movie.  The story of this movie is very good; the story is actually very interesting, in an entertaining way.  It is a very short movie, with only about 5 minutes left, but it has a nice message to it, which should be remembered by the younger generations of today, who are going to be very confused by the upcoming world of the future, but should be happy, they will be able to see how mankind is being helped by artificial intelligence.   This movie does contain a little bit of sci-fi elements, but at the end, you won't see much of that, this movie simply is a simple story about a man trying to save his daughter, who was being forced into slavery in a futuristic, dystopian world.    This movie is a good watch, and will keep you on the edge of your seat; but in reality, if you don't know the ending of this story, you're really missing out on a good adventure!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see this movie. I had high hopes for it as it was made by John Carpenter. I know he is a big fan of the original one as I watched his movie in my dorm room with my brothers. We were all 8 and 10 at the time, but I remember it with great fondness.   When I saw the movie the first thing that caught my eye was the fact that it seemed to be a little more in the vein of his other movies, but it was the look of the movie that drew me in. It seemed to have been taken from the book about the book I read about 2 weeks ago. The book was called "The Unholy Three" and I haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I think it was about a scientist, an explorer and a priest who all discover a secret temple in the jungle.  They are all very successful in their search but they also all have their secrets. The priest is always working and never seems to be too happy. He is always trying to find a "way" to help the others but he is very secretive about his discoveries.  I did not like the character he played, he seemed to get out of control in the movie and it wasn't good at all.  The story of "The Devil's Hand" was a pretty interesting one. It really reminded me a lot of "Hellraiser" in some aspects. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't an actual devil involved, though.  There were a few scenes that really got me in the mood for the movie but they all had to be cut out.  Also, while watching the movie I saw a man standing on a hillside with the "Devil's Hand". It is a lot like the one in the book and I just don't like it.  A few things really bothered me and they were the following:  One scene I really wish had been included was in the middle of the film where the priest and the explorer are walking along a path.  While walking they both seem to be talking about the other and the first explorer asks about the "devil's hand" and then the second explorer asks the first one about his "devils hand".  What's really strange about this scene is that there is nothing in the text saying anything about "Devils Hand", yet both explorers start talking about it. This could mean that they are talking about some sort of supernatural force and they both
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a man (Gunnar) who can transform into a powerful and fierce demon at will. The movie does not follow any plot. As a matter of fact, the movie is a collection of short vignettes (from three to eleven minutes) about the man's life and relationships. He is married to a woman (Coen) and has a child. But they are separated when a young woman (Amantha) arrives in his house and they start a relationship. He sees her as a potential replacement wife. His son dies when he is attacked by a tiger. The man goes to live with a girl (Amanda) and the movie seems like a parody about the boy-meets-girl kind of romance. It's an amusing but not very interesting film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sorry, but I cannot even begin to fathom how to explain how I felt watching this movie.   It is not just a bad movie that needs to be forgotten, but a sad and depressing movie that shows the human condition in a very, very tragic way.  At first, we see the love of this mother and how she tries to keep her child alive.  But then she begins to suffer and eventually dies from a stroke.  She goes to the hospital in a motorized wheelchair, but the doctors don't give her a chance to be happy with her life. They don't see her as a person who can live a long life.  They tell her that she can live in a nursing home and that she could have a little while longer.   But when she is asked to give birth to her daughter in a hospital bed, she asks for a deathbed request.  And when she asks the doctors for a second opinion, they tell her they can't help her because she is brain dead.  So they do everything they can to make her as comfortable as possible.  Until she passes.  If this wasn't terrible enough, she passes after being given one last gift to give.   Her husband.  The man who gave her one last chance to live and was more than willing to take it.  He is given one day to give her one more gift, and she tells him not to stop giving her love.  How she wanted him to make a real man out of her and live the rest of her life with her.   When we learn about this man we see that he is an alcoholic and a drug addict and has been in prison and jail his entire life. He is a bad man and a selfish one at that.  There is a scene where he shows his wife his tattoo with his name on it.   This tells us how selfish he truly is.  This is the man that killed his wife and took her body and brought it back home to her.  As soon as he comes home he is asked about his tattoo.  When he tells his wife that it was a tribute to her, and that he was proud of it and honored her, she is very angry and tells him to give it back and then she will kill him and take the body home with her and bury it in a place of her choosing.  In one moment, he had his wife, his children, his brothers and sisters, and his
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. I would give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the fact that one of the characters is a big old balding man with big ears. He has a huge and obnoxious voice but I think that it works. It reminds you that this movie is supposed to be humorous. I'm not going to go into details about the plot. I think you can figure it out. It's a good, simple story. I like how it is based on a book (the novel). The movie isn't so well thought out. There is no real action or plot, it's just funny and has a lot of good actors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed the movie, it was good, but I think it could have been better. I liked the characters, the script was pretty good and I like the "movie-within-the-movie" style of it. It was like the opening scenes, except instead of looking like a film, it looked like a video game.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie, the only negative I can think of is that the director, while showing his real talent in the movie, does not show how amazing he is with a camera or in motion, which is a shame because the actors in this movie are so great, that the movie is just great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie. There is some interesting parts to it, but it has a lot of plot holes and it ends up being a really bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "LOST" may not have a "feel good" ending, but it certainly has a very interesting story. There is a good mystery here that is interesting and engaging in it's own right.   I love a good "whodunnit", a "who really did it?" movie!   You know this is the end when the phone goes off...   A solid movie that is worth the time to sit down and watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a well-acted, well-told story about the life of a young man who comes to work as a gardener on a Southern plantation. He falls in love with the housekeeper, and, being unable to marry her due to religious reasons, he is determined to kill her.  He attempts this by poisoning the water supply, and killing the plantation keeper.  But the gardener is clever, and manages to kill him with the water. This leads to a showdown between the gardner and the plantation owner, who manages to convince the gardiner that his only way of escape is to kill the plantation's owner as well.  This leads into a chase to escape across the country, where the gardinator is caught by the sheriff, and is put to death. The film is set during the Civil War, and the protagonist has to make the ultimate sacrifice, so that his beloved can live.  Although it is written in the style of a Western, it has some strong feminist elements:  The main female character is portrayed as a strong woman, and she becomes an object of affection and admiration for the protagonist.  She even gets a romantic lead in the form of a handsome stranger, played by a talented young actor.  The film does contain some racist images:  Black people, including women, are shown as having a higher social standing, and are usually seen in the role of servants.  And it features a female love interest:  But as you can see in this review, there are also lots of beautiful women.  I also found the music to be beautiful, and I loved how the music played during a chase sequence, and as the two main characters, who were very beautiful in their own right, battled it out.   The acting of the two lead characters was excellent.  It is one of the few films where I don't have a problem with the performances of a female lead.  For instance, this is the scene where the protagonist takes a knife from a man:  Although I am sure that most people would not find this to be a good scene, the role that the lead female is given to play makes it all the more memorable.  One of the more difficult characters to empathize with is the gardin, because he is portrayed in such a stereotypical manner:  However, he can also be very romantic.  As the film progresses, I have to say that this is one that I would recommend to both men and women.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not a "serious" movie, but this is a fun movie and I like it a lot.   This was a fun family movie. I liked how it was a little bit edgy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie is not always great - especially when it's a sequel - but The Black Dahlia is pretty good.   It is based on the book by Jay McInerney and written by Kevin Williamson.  The movie features a lot of scenes filmed in Hollywood, like the famous car chase and the film studio shootout.  As I said - it is very well made, with a pretty good plot, and lots of great performances (if you can look past the fact that it's about a serial killer).   As a movie - and I hope you'll agree with me - it's pretty good, but there's a lot to be done here.  Some of the plot elements of the story could have been explored more.  And in a movie based on a book with so much more going on - a movie that is a sequel to a movie, with lots of twists - it can be easy to lose track of things in the first half, and so I felt a little let down at the end.  That is just my opinion.  A good movie, though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the third time that my father and I have seen this movie. I have watched it a number of times and I like it very much. It is a very different kind of drama than the other two that I have viewed and that is the good in it. It was made in the 1930's. It has a very serious atmosphere. There are lots of very realistic shots of people's lives. There is a man with a great deal of money and he is trying to keep it. The women are pretty, some of them are very pretty. The dialogue is sometimes difficult to understand. It contains a lot of real incidents. It would be a good film if we could only find a studio to make a movie about it. - September 5, 2007I really enjoyed this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was very good and funny. The only downside was that I could not understand all of the dialogue.   This movie was pretty cool, and I'm sure the original director, Robert Zemeckis, and his writing partners were a lot of fun to be around.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the new generation of Sci-fi movies and i love the new style and a lot of the other movies are not as good as them. But this one is very good, the way the characters are introduced and develop really interested me. I really liked the alien character and the way he spoke english. I like the way this story was told and i hope they will continue it in the future.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot and really liked that there is a great mystery to be solved and I am glad that the mystery gets solved. I was expecting a good mystery but I don't think it was very good. This was a film that needed a little more depth to it and I feel like I am missing some of it with how slow the story seemed to be. There was a few things that bothered me about the movie but I felt like I was able to see some of the problems with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film takes place during the Korean War but the action is quite slow as the military is too busy fighting in the rear areas of the field of battle. The film does an excellent job at highlighting the plight of a soldier who was captured by the enemy. He had been given a choice of life on the front or a slow death in prison. He chose to live.   This is a very strong movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had heard about this movie from a friend so I went to see it for the first time last night, and I must say that it was one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. It has some of the best special effects I have seen in any movie.   It is also extremely realistic with some of my favorites being the car chases, and the amazing shot of a bullet passing through the barrel of a pistol. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The worst movie I ever saw in my life and now I've seen a LOT of movies and I really liked this one, I didn't like it so much but it's really worth watching because the story is interesting, a really good story that isn't all that original (I mean it does have some very cool stuff but it still has the same kind of plot that I've been seeing a lot lately in these movies) but it is still good, it's just a movie where some people are out to kill each other and it's good for the time that it was made because it has the time travelling aspect that I really like, it even has a really cool little robot.   I don't like time travel because the plot always seems to be the same or it's a very convoluted plot that goes nowhere (even when the plot goes nowhere it's still the same boring old plot) but the story that the movie has is still interesting because it does contain the time travel aspect and it doesn't go away like the movies that I watched in the past but this one was a little better than the ones I watched before that did have time travel but this is still not a time travel movie and it probably will never be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a good story about the "soul-sucking monster," and a very unique one, as I will try to explain.   What I like about this movie is that it has some good action, and some interesting, intriguing things about its characters and the plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First I want to say that I'm not sure I like this movie.   I liked it a lot.  I really do.  It's a good, good, funny movie with lots of stuff to laugh at.  When it was over, I felt a little sick.  This movie is about a group of misfits that find themselves on a big boat and the ship's captain has lost his mind.  They have to get off the boat and out of the water and all the other things they're supposed to do and all of the other crazy things they come up with while they're on the boat.  The movie has a very different feel to it than any movie I've seen, it's a great story and a funny movie. That's why I loved it so much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You've got to see this film! I have to say that this film is a gem and I couldn't be more thrilled to see it again. My one complaint is that it's a bit too long, I really wish it would've been shorter!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a really interesting movie. I thought it was very good. The script by Paul Dini is really good. But it can be a little over the top at times, so be prepared for it. The effects are amazing. I did not like how the movie ended though. I feel like they should of ended at the scene where they all died. It was a shame. But overall great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the few films that has me smiling from ear to ear.   It's so simple, but the acting is so great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie a lot. I like the idea of the story and the characters and the plot itself is pretty funny, it makes the movie pretty well told and a good idea to put a couple characters in a bar.  I also liked that the movie was very funny.   It had a really good plot but I didn't feel like it took a long time to get to the good part, in fact when I was finished it was only a couple of minutes past when it should have been in the beginning.  The other part that I liked was the humor.  It was a good mix of comedy and drama and all the characters are so well acted.  My only complaint is the fact that when it came to the main plot it had a bit of a slow start, like I said in my review, it was still funny and the main character was very well acted by a few of the actors, but it was a bit confusing at times.  Overall I liked the movie very much and would recommend it to anyone who likes movies about crazy characters who love each other and are in a bad situation and need to get out of it together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the film but there are two problems with it.   The first is that it gets off on the wrong foot and is a very slow start to what is supposed to be a fantastic film.  In the second problem I think that it is a little over the top and maybe if they were going to make a film about a vampire who turns into a werewolf I think they should have taken a more cautious approach and let us get to know the character better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just found out that this is the third sequel in a trilogy that started out like a fun little horror movie in the early 90's. The director is Joe Dante, who has directed a few movies, including a few great indie movies like 'Walls.' And the cast is the same. I like this movie because there is a lot of nudity and it's about a group of people (that were not the same group that made the movie!) that were victims of a curse that put them in the grave and the only way to get them back is to find a witch and bring her to the grave. So they find a dead woman and the witch (played by a lovely, young and sexy actress named Lisa Deffan) comes to the party. They need to bring the witch back. And if they can't find a wizard that can kill the witch, they have to come up with a plan to get revenge. As the movie goes on, they find out about the curse and that it can't be killed (or maybe it can and it doesn't want to). So we're left with a pretty good idea of who the witch is and what her intentions are. But this movie is still a little hard to watch. It's not like a comedy, but it's hard to take any seriously when so many characters are so obviously meant to be laughing at the movie. At least, in the beginning. But I guess I'm going to have to give it a "fair" rating. It has a good cast of characters, but there are a lot too many. If you're looking for a pretty funny, well made movie that will make you forget about the horrible stuff that happened in the previous movie (because of the curse that was in this movie), this is a good, easy to watch, fun little movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is a good film to watch for those who want to have a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I were to tell you what the movie was about I would say it was about two men trying to find the most important thing in the world. It was about a man who wanted a new life and a man that had nothing but the most mundane day to day life. I didn't care about any of the characters other than the two men.   As I said before this is a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very good. It is a story of a hero who goes to the war, fights with the bad guys and is very much a hero. His attitude towards the war is to never give up, so much so that he has the spirit to go to another country to fight in the war. The film has a great sense of humour which has been very well done. The movie also has a story line of war and the hero has some really cool moments.   I have seen this movie a few times on video and thought it was pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was a pretty cool movie. It had an action-heavy storyline that took place in a future where people are "born" into the world, then have their memories wiped to erase any memories of their previous lives. They are also sent back to the future in "time machines" so they can go back and experience those lives and live them once again, but the real-life consequences are pretty bad. This story was pretty interesting, though, it had some pretty nice special effects, and a great soundtrack, but it's just not for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say about "Everest"  ? It's a good film. It's funny, it's good and I have to admit it's a great story. It would make a great movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The original concept of the story is pretty interesting. The way this movie deals with what seems to be a real-life war, the idea of creating a war from a non-military, non-governmental point of view is intriguing. It doesn't completely capture the feeling of the actual war, but at the very least makes an effort. The film takes the action seriously and it takes the viewer on a somewhat unusual journey into a noncombat environment. The characters feel real and there is some genuine tension between them. The pacing of the film is pretty slow. It's almost like watching a slow motion video. If the movie had been longer I think it would have been much better, but as it is it is still interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a must see movie for both kids and adults.   The story follows the two brothers (one black and one white) who try to save their grandfather from a murderous gang.  It is a good way to start a story, and a good example to teach children about being good and doing good.  The movie has a great story about a guy trying to save his grandfather from being lynched by a mob, and it is told in a classic Italian way.  What I liked best about the movie was that it showed the true history of the black and white brothers as they were growing up in a world full of racism, and all that racism came from the older black brothers (as was the case in Italy in the late 1800's).   I watched the movie with my sister (now my wife). I think she thought the movie made her look stupid, but she didn't know what she was getting into.  And the Italian way of telling a story (using the word 'toto' instead of 'tira') was a nice touch that I really liked.  I hope this movie gets a big release in the USA. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think I'm doing it justice, but I'm very impressed with the way in which this film makes you feel the effect of all those hours spent on the couch.   It makes you wonder about the things you do not yet know.  I was watching this in the theatre a couple of weeks ago and it really was so impressive.  What do you think about a movie that uses all those techniques at it's disposal, and doesn't take itself too seriously at all?   The ending was good too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not sure if it is better or worse than 'Battleship'.   You know how many times when I read an interesting description of a ship or a battle, I always try to picture it. In 'Battersea' a ship goes by and I'm imagining a ship. I do that to get a better picture of what I think the ship looks like. This movie makes no sense. I think they were looking at a movie in a small room and forgot to add any sound effects and camera moves.   The movie is a good time. I would like to see a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film at a preview, and I thought it was alright. It's a good film, and a good story. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that the main characters are all too friendly. It seems like they wanted to be friends with everybody but instead of being just friends they were really close, and it's not like they went on a date.   For those of you who have not seen this film, it is based off a true story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of good movies, it's not all perfect. It's not a terrible movie by any means, but it's also not a great movie either.   What I like about this movie is that it has a lot going on, but this movie could have been better if it had taken place more often, but that is a matter of taste.  To me, this is a great example of what great films can do when they aren't perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got this movie on VHS on VCR about 15 years ago. I don't really remember much about the movie other than the ending, I had forgotten about it after watching the trailer and the film was pretty forgettable, not much dialogue and that too is a very small role. But it is worth watching, it is well made and has some funny moments.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cast is great, including the always charming Bruce Dern. And the plot is quite good too, but not much more is required.    "Gee whiz" is the word that springs to mind when you think about this movie, and even then I think of an entirely different movie.  A family is in peril as they try to find a safe haven, but they get more than they bargained for when a meteorite comes flying toward their tiny, rural hamlet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very good movie in general. The story is good, and it is funny at times, but it is also kind of a slow movie. I wish they had slowed it down a little more.   In terms of action, it is pretty good. It is sort of like a buddy cop movie, with the bad guy being a man in a costume. I think the mask thing is pretty funny, and the guy's voice is pretty cool. It takes a while for the plot to get going, but once it does it is good.    It is pretty long too, but the last half hour is pretty decent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie very much.   This movie takes place a few years after the war.  It tells the story of a soldier who was caught up in the war and he has to live with his own guilt about that war and the events that happened to him during that time.  This is an interesting story because he is an anti-hero and he makes a lot of mistakes and gets caught up some bad events.  However, the best part about this movie is it's visuals.  The movie takes a look at the war through the eyes of the soldier.  His eyes are sad and filled with sadness.  But, at the same time he has a certain confidence and that is what makes you want to see how he will make it out of the war alive.  So, what are some of the other good things about this?  The cinematography is excellent and you are not disappointed with the way the movie looks.  There is some good action in the movie and the movie does a good job of showing it.  What else would I say about the movie?  I really liked the story, and it's a good story.  I found it interesting to learn about the people that lived during the war, and I was able to appreciate a lot about them and how they are living in the post-war era.  You should definitely watch this movie and I recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:     If you haven't seen the movie, then you need to watch it. It is just a fantastic movie that is packed full of heart.   There are plenty of reasons to watch this film. I think the main reason is because I believe the writer could of written this film and it would have been perfect.  It is about a very brave man who is not afraid to face his fears. A lot of other actors do excellent work in this film that I would like to discuss a bit about them.  First of all,  Jef Costello is simply a great role that he is given. He is a man who has a great heart, but a great courage and strength. The film really shows how a man can overcome so much to do good, but in the end he is faced with the fear of death. Jef is a very honest man that is filled with great compassion and a very good sense of humor. He will not give up even when he is down. His compassion to those around him makes this a very great movie.  The other great actor in the movie is  Michael Parks. He doesn't have a huge role in the film, but he does a really great job. It seems as if he is always around to help Jef and I believe he is. He seems to be a very likeable man and a good man to have around.  Finally, there are other great roles played by  Kevin J. O'Connell, John K. Brown Jr. and  Tom Sizemore. O'Donnel has a fantastic role in this movie. He has an unbelievable amount of charisma in this character that is amazing.  Overall, a great movie with a great script and an amazing film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. This is a story of a man who was captured and put on a conveyor belt to the bottom of the ocean. He was put there so a group of scientists could see if he was truly intelligent. They then put him in a tank and started feeding him fish from the sea floor. When they were all done, he managed to walk to the surface of the water. He then took a bite out of the fish that he ate from the floor. The scientists were shocked to see how smart he was. He quickly took over the group of men. The whole story is told in a non-stop way. At one point, he even got into a boxing match with a little girl who was on the other side of a wall from him. He eventually broke through the wall and saved the girl from drowning. The girl then came up to the group and took the man's hand, then they kissed. This was one of my favorite movies.   Dumb and Dumber: An Unexpected Journey  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new entry on my list of all-time-great sci-fi/horror films!   In the not-so-distant future the world is suffering from environmental pollution and a virus that makes people go mad. To deal with these environmental problems the military has developed a vaccine using an animal, the "Virus Hunter", to "hunt" the virus out of the world. As the government has no hope of protecting themselves from the virus, they turn to a private corporation who will use whatever technology they can to try and fight the virus.   The virus hunter is a supercomputer program which can predict what the virus will do.  It is programmed to run on one hundred million dollars a day in funding, and the government gives it to a man named Jack Loper, a man who hates computers and is determined to not let it go to waste.  The first day he is sent to a research lab and begins to track down the virus using his computer, but things get more complicated when a woman named Laura starts to suspect that he is infected and she takes him into a secluded farmhouse where she meets a man by the name of "Mr. B" and soon the two begin to fall in love with each other and their friendship grows stronger.  This movie is one of the best I've seen in my life.  What I love about this movie is how it's a really realistic portrayal of what would happen if humans started developing super-technology.  Every little thing from the first scene to the last scene is done so well that I wanted it to happen. It's so realistic that it's even believable that people would come up with these crazy ideas.  I really liked the whole concept of this movie.  They use the computer to actually be a character and be the one to track the virus in order to protect people from it. I think that's pretty good storytelling.  In a lot of the movies I watch now, there are just a few bad guys out to destroy the earth.  But not this one.  All the bad guys are really cute in their little robot costumes and come off as very interesting characters.  If you like science fiction/horrror you really should watch this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a film with a good script that takes you on a fascinating trip. This is an adventure about the exploration of an alien planet and is about a scientist who is not what he seems. He finds a planet that has water and then realizes he is supposed to study this planet to discover the secret of the "green man" and to create a machine that would allow the man to live forever. The film is a very exciting and entertaining sci-fi film.   If you are in the mood for some good old-fashioned space adventure and you like space-fiction then "The Planet of the Apes" is a movie for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A pretty good movie about a boy and his dog, who have to solve a murder by taking pictures of the victims' clothes as they're put away in a closet. There's a very interesting ending.   The film has a couple of funny parts. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at a friend's house while we were out to eat and I don't usually watch action/drama movies, but I really liked it. The main character, James (James Marsden), a former gang member who has turned to the "wrong side" of the law, has a very good chemistry with the female lead, Karen (Katie Holmes). They are both extremely good actors and they work well together. I found the movie's ending a bit disappointing because it didn't feel like it ended in a very positive way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I go back and forth, as we are so different.   She lives in the country, where she lives off of a cow farm.  She is so good natured.  I live in a big city, where I have a job as an airline pilot.  Now, if you are looking for an emotional movie, this is the movie for you.  The characters are so well developed that you start to see why she is so great.  What makes it even better, is that all the characters, except one, are real people with families.  There are some good laughs, and good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is pretty simple: the boy gets a new toy, the boy goes to the house of his new toy's parents, the mother gets angry with the boy for taking her son's toy, but then she goes to her husband, and the husband, who is an evil bad-ass, goes around killing the parents and all the babies, then they all live happily ever after.   It's just a simple plot, but it's one that's hard to ignore.  This movie is about a bad-assed dad who does a pretty good job of killing all his children, which he gets back at them with some pretty wicked moves, including a gun that makes a man die of a heart attack by firing a bullet into the man's heart.  The main cast is pretty good: the wife has a little son who does his best to ignore his dad, while the parents have a daughter who does her best to kill her dad and all his friends.  It was a decent, but not memorable movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. I loved the characters, their interactions, and even their "savior" of the world. This was a nice sequel, not to the first movie. Although there were some elements of the first that were very similar, the movie is much more intense and interesting.   Thanks to the fantastic dialogue and strong performances of the actors, this movie made me love the idea of a hero in a world where only the strongest survive. The movie is not that funny or action packed, but the characters and their dialogues are well written and have a lot of heart.  I give this movie a 10/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It was a good time in the theater and I can see why everyone loves it so much. The acting in this movie is good with most of the actors doing a good job with their parts. The story line and characters are interesting enough to keep my attention through the film. The music is great and I think that the songs would fit well on the soundtrack of this movie. The only negative I can think of about this movie and it's overall score is that some of the scenes with the "villains" could have been cut out and it would be an awesome movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen it. It's a good film. My only complaint is that the actors didn't seem that close to each other.   My friend and I watched it with the sound on. We could actually hear each other talking in their respective characters' voices.  It's an enjoyable movie. The action sequences are great and the story is well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I hope this is the first of many more bad decisions.   "The Big Lebowski"   is a bad movie with a bad ending.  A stupid ending with a horrible movie.  This is a great movie but I hope it is the last.  My only problem is the ending, the only reason this movie is bad is because it is a terrible movie. I have never watched so bad or boring a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to see this movie. My brother and I have a lot of friends that are big fans of John Carpenter. He really does have an eye for the surreal, and I was definitely intrigued by this one.   This film is pretty much what you would expect from a Carpenter film. There are a few little things here and there that make this more than a straight action movie.  There's a few scenes where you see a bunch of soldiers all wearing similar costumes with matching faces. I thought it was kind of cool.  They were really trying to bring some character into it, but it just didn't really work out.  One thing that annoyed me a little bit was how all the soldiers were wearing the same suits, which is just silly.  The film ends with an extended chase scene that ends up being pretty short, and a lot like the first half of the movie. I'm sure this is the most boring ending you're ever going to see, and one that wouldn't have worked so well if they had put any effort into it.  As far as the story is concerned, I actually really liked it. I was really interested in what would happen in the next couple of episodes. The movie ends with a bang, but a pretty weak one. It's not really that much of a film after all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I've been watching a lot of movies lately. This is a nice movie about a guy who loves to play basketball and it's his dream to become an NBA star. He meets a girl named Danni and they go on dates. Danni is a beautiful girl, a model and plays the trumpet. They are going to get married someday and she is looking forward to the big day. The only problem is, he doesn't want it to be on the big stage. He gets himself ready in a room with a pool table, a couch, a few towels, a box of ice, and a box full of old clothes. He plays around for a while and then gets his first chance at a game. He has no shot and so he tries to hide his feelings about his wife. He decides that if he can just put a little spin on his shot, then it'll be alright. He ends up getting his first and only basket of the night. He's so proud of himself that he can't stop smiling.

I was able to relate to most of the characters because I am a little different than them. One of the good things about this movie is that it has a good soundtrack that was really good! This movie is good! I wish I could give it a perfect score but I don't think I can. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't want this to end.   After seeing the trailer for this movie I just knew that the best part would be the sex and nudity.  From the moment the movie begins I couldn't stop looking at the sexy bodies and watching their boobs get sucked on by the other girls.  They all look great in their bikinis too.  The plot is really bad.  I guess they want to be funny and don't need to go into the sex scene.  But I wish they had gone in a little more.  And they should have done a little less of the whole slut-shaming.  In the end, there was a pretty good ending but I wish the main characters could have been a little nicer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say, I liked this movie. I liked the story. I had no problem following the plot. I was a little bit confused about the character development, as he seemed to develop on his own. I didn't have a problem with the acting. It is clear what the director was going for and I don't think it was a bad film. It was just a little confusing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The thing is - if you are a movie critic - it is your job to analyze the movies. You are not a writer. You're not a playwright. You cannot create an original movie. You can only tell your own story. So it's a very good and good looking movie, but it really does not tell a story - it just is a story. It is a very fun movie and it makes good use of the characters - especially the heroine. A very pleasant surprise, and an interesting, fun, and interesting movie.   I would like to see the director do a "sequel".   It is about a young girl who has a very close and special friend. And she has a lot of fun with her friend. It may be a little over the top, but there are a lot interesting situations in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little skeptical about watching a movie about a group of people who like to hang out and have sex in public. I was looking for a little horror film to watch with my husband and it seemed a little too silly. It has an interesting story but I was not really drawn to it. There are many sex scenes that I don't remember. There is a very hot and seductive movie about people who hang out in public and have fun.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film with the kids, and it was a nice little movie to watch. We had a couple of laughs at the "pilot" of the film, when he is trying to put a ring on his girlfriend (I have a feeling, it was for a wedding). But then it got good! I loved all the songs, we even had a nice long "Ride-On-Up" from "Weird Al". The ending, when they all get back home, was great, they did a real good job of making the movie a family movie. It was a short little film, but did a good job at capturing some of my feelings about how I felt back in the 80's, that I still have, even though things have changed, they are still "Weir."    So far, this has been a great movie, and I really think if they continue to make more movies like this, they should be around for a while!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter and I sat through this movie last night and were not disappointed. The story is fairly straightforward. A man goes to a small town to see if he can find someone to adopt his daughter. While looking for her, he gets a call from the local police and asks what the story is with the missing girl. He gets told she has gone to a psychiatric hospital where she is going to be evaluated. He then meets a young man by the name of Steve who is a recovering addict who has a wife and daughter and he has come to town to help her find her missing child. They also meet a little girl named Sophie who is going through a tough time herself and is being raised by a father named Tom (Michael Caine). Sophie is the only daughter in a big family but one little thing about her has changed her from the child Sophie once was to a beautiful young woman with a wicked sense of humor and the desire to do things her own way. Tom is looking for the same things in Sophie that he once did with his daughters and has come up with some interesting ideas that I am sure the audience will like to hear about. The movie is funny and funny at times. It is pretty good looking, too. The editing is good and I did like the movie. The music is just right for it. If you are in the mood for a good old fashioned cowboy movie with a little bit of heart then you will like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film about a couple who can't save the life of their newborn child, they end up making a documentary about the birth of their child.   "We knew from the get-go that this film was going to be unique and special. Not to mention, a lot of the film is an ode to love. We knew that the whole thing was going be pretty strange to look at, but it is very charming. We were so amazed at how a couple will create a documentary on their love for their child, and what they feel about each other. When I was watching it, I felt a very strong connection to the people in this movie and I can't help but think that my wife and I are the lucky ones to be a part of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is nothing wrong with this movie. It is pretty much a remake of the original from 1988 and there are really not much changes. The movie has the same type of characters, who are not the least bit different in appearance, but have been completely changed to fit the world of the movie. The story is pretty similar to the original movie and in a sense it is similar to many of the movies I have seen. It takes a while to get going but the story is very interesting.   The music is really good and fits the movie and also is really well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       The ending made my mouth water.   For those that don't understand the story, the film is about a guy named Sam. Sam is a big guy, but when he does something, people love to watch it. One day he has an idea.  He wants to take a girl on a date, but since she's got a boyfriend, he's forced to be a gentleman and sit home and listen to her.  In a hilarious ending, Sam and the girl have sex and it doesn't end well for either of them.  Then they go back to the place they met, and the next day Sam and his girlfriend have sex again. This time Sam has no choice but to put her on the back seat and sit back and admire himself in the mirror while the girl cries because of the pain in her pussy.  I love a good story, and I found this to be one that was worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a nutshell:   The film is a noir crime drama in the mold of  The Maltese Falcon.   This film is very much like its predecessor.   It is a film about a woman and her husband that are trying to make a living in the underworld.  I would say that this film is about a couple living the life of crime and getting caught.  It doesn't follow the formula that the previous film was following.  Some of the best moments in the film involves the relationship of the man (Cyril) and the woman (Charlotte).   As the film goes on the relationship goes sour and the wife is forced to go on the run.  If you like  The Italian Job,  The Blues Brothers ,  or  any of the other films in this vein you should check this out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie last summer when I was visiting my relatives in Canada. I was not impressed by the movie. Not a lot of the characters were likable. I don't know why there wasn't a whole lot of action in the movie as most movies I see are. There were many scenes where the actors seemed to be doing the same thing over and over again. One character was dressed as a lady. A few scenes were a lot like a romance and a few scenes was a lot more like a comedy. I have never liked a lot in a romance, much less a comedy/drama. I did enjoy a couple of the action scenes though.   I really liked this movie. I'm still laughing about the opening scene. It was so funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really pleased with this movie. It was not a "Star Wars" movie but it had enough of a "feel" to it. There are some "special effects" (which is to be expected) and the "plot" is fairly original. But it has its flaws. And while there are some good scenes in this movie, a lot of the plot is repetitive, with no sense of urgency. But I think if the "star" of the movie is the characters, there are many that have depth and are likable. The only thing that did bother me about this movie was the ending. It left a bad taste.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the movie it's based on is about a group of people in a city that are trying to make the best of a bad situation with a lot of help from the cops.   The movie is very entertaining.  It's set in Detroit, Michigan, a city made famous for its riots in the 1970s.  The film is about people that are just trying to get by in the city.  At the time of the movie we are dealing with a major blackout that occurs throughout the city at night.  This is a very violent time of day for those who live in Detroit.  When this black out takes place the whole city starts to shake.  In the center of the city the police have been ordered to fire on anyone seen walking around the streets.  These people are mostly black but there are a few whites who work for the police and have to do the right thing.  A man by the name of Don is one of those who have to perform this duty. He doesn't know what this job is all about but he has to do it.  He is a cop who is trying to do right by his fellow officers and his town. He tries his best to get them to shoot at the rioting blacks but he can't seem to convince them to do anything.  Don has a wife and two children who he needs to take care of. He has a hard time finding anyone to help him and eventually he finds a man who he can trust to help with his case.  His name is James. James is a good guy who doesn't want to shoot blacks.  But he does not know how to handle the situation.  James tries to help Don and his wife make some money and get by.  They have a lot to worry about.  If they can just stay together they could be saved but that would be at the risk of James's life.  So who will survive in this world of black and white?   It gets really good when James comes up with a way to get his wife and children out of the problem they are in.  And who will save them?  I really liked the way that the director tried to show the black and whites trying to find a way out of this mess.  I think that if they are able to do that, then they will be able to stay together.  My only disappointment was that the film ended a little too soon.  Even though there were a lot more
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . ..   -... A very cool and original idea.   "The Book of Life" tells the story of a woman with a terrible condition in which she can be reborn after being murdered. The movie is very interesting. It's very well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I think the movie is one of the best movie from the first movie (although I'm not sure how the other two movies did) because the whole plot is very good and funny, but the movie has a very original plot that isn't really typical: The movie is actually about a woman who falls in love with a black man because he has a big nose. I never knew that in real life that there was this type of a woman or a woman that love this type a men. It's a very good movie and I love the way the black man has a new kind of look because he is very handsome, he also is a bit different because he's black and has a dark personality, and he doesn't look like a real man, he doesn' look like any real man can. I liked this movie very much, it's a good funny movie, but a good romantic movie as well because it's very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first watched this film I had a lot of questions about the character of Joe Sargent (played by the great Johnny Cash). I found myself thinking that the guy was a nice enough guy and I had fun watching his routine with Cash in the middle of the movie.   This movie has a lot to offer, but at times it feels like the filmmakers are trying to make it too complicated.  The movie has three parts, and the first two parts are good. This third part is a little disappointing.  I was hoping for more of a connection with Joe's father. He was the one who first got Joe involved in the entertainment business and who introduced him to the big boys.  This last scene was pretty much a rehash of the first scene. I was hoping that Joe would get some kind of an explanation as to why he and his father are still so close.  It was hard for me to connect with the movie in a positive way.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of The Dark Knight and was happy that a new film was being made that gave us a chance to see the caped crusader as he was in the comics. I was impressed with the special effects and with the costume design. The story was a little thin and not very interesting but that is because the story is so dark and gritty.   The movie starts off with a flashback to when Batman first went after the Joker.  This is the scene that the Joker uses to get to the police that is out hunting him.  The scene takes place in a garage but what you do not know is that Joker has tricked Batman into coming to this place.  What you do know is the Joker is in a black costume that seems to change with each scene.  He is sitting in the garage. He then takes off the cowl to reveal a mask with only a pair of eyes.  When he takes the c,h mask off he has blue eyes like he has a real problem on his hands.  Joker is on a bike and he is telling everyone about how he plans to kill Batman.  However, Batman doesn't go off with the villain so he decides to go with his buddy Thomas Wayne (Bruce).  He and Thomas run to a house where they are getting ready to fight.  As they walk into the room they see a black cat that seems like a little toy but then he jumps on a table and runs off.  I think they should have put the scene after the battle.  It makes the ending a little confusing because it seems like the cat is following them but it is really just a trap.  That is when Batman turns into a bat and goes after the cat.  After a short fight they are back in the house where Bruce is in bed watching a movie on TV.  Thomas gets up and tells Batman that he is not feeling good so he goes to get some water but instead of bringing a bottle he takes a can and chugs it.  Batman then knocks on the door and gets a phone call and goes out to deal with some criminals.  We then cut to a flashback scene to when Bruce Wayne was still a kid.  A young Bruce Wayne is playing in the basement of the mansion and then he hears someone laughing in the kitchen.  Bruce is so scared that he drops the can.  In the next scene we get a flashback of the death of his parents.  Then we see his childhood

The violence is done well and the sex is very good as well. I have seen more action movies with sex and more violence. I can't find a better story in a movie about a dark and violent inner city Los Angeles, except maybe the later Batman movie and even then only for its violence.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a good bad movie, this one.   "Oh, so, you want to see a film about a man who is cursed with an uncanny ability to have a conversation with a dead woman, and who is forced to deal with the consequences of it?"   Yeah, sure.  I just wish it weren't in the same movie as "Hooked On A Feeling".   I mean, that one's great too.  A little too far afield for me to care about anything else going on there... but this one has an awful lot going on, and all of it is just kind of irritating.  This movie starts off with the man (who turns out to be a woman) having a conversation about a dead guy she found.  The guy (in the form of a dead person) talks to her about things like being stuck in the ground, and being trapped in a car.  So far, so good.  She decides she needs to get out of there, and so she goes to her boyfriend's house.  There's a little girl in the house who can hear him talking to the dead person.  He's not a bad actor.  And they both seem to enjoy themselves a bit.  But then the guy wakes up, and turns out he's still in the dead body, and is now trapped inside the dead girl's house as well.  Now we have a man trapped inside a dead girl.  It's like, are these movies designed with male viewers in mind?  It looks pretty gross in there.  Things start to get... weird.  One of the guys starts to "help" the girl out of the house, but not in a sexual manner.  They're talking about stuff, but he isn't touching the dead thing, but the girl is touching it.  Then he starts to have sex with her, but it doesn't look like he's doing it from the inside out, and the girl isn't interested.  Eventually, the girl decides she wants to go get the guys' clothes.  Here's where the movie starts to go off the deep end.  First of all, a guy is trapped inside of a girl.   It's an impossible situation, even by today's standards.   And then there's the fact that the girl keeps telling the guy, "I'm not your girlfriend.    I want to have your baby."   The dead guy keeps saying,
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of "Inland Empire" is actually based on a true story. The story itself has many similarities with a film titled "In the Valley of the Shadow" made in the 1950s by director Howard Hawks. Although the "In The Valley of The Shadow" has its own peculiar characteristics, I personally prefer the "in the Inland Empire".   "Inlander" is a well-made and original movie. I'm glad it's getting some attention.   A few other reviews:   (click on the title)   - (click here to go to the movie)    In the beginning of the film, a local news show shows a man's face in a jar and asks his neighbors whether they are willing to help him identify his face in the mirror. The man, William, goes to his home to answer this question and the rest of the story unfolds.  At first, I was not sure if I would like this movie. However, after seeing it again and again I changed my mind. In "In Inland Emperor" we are given an insight into the lives of four different men in a small town. This small town is one of the most typical ones in terms of everyday life. Each man has his own business that he runs; a small factory, a barber shop, a grocery store and his own house. The people living in this town have to overcome difficulties that only their own kind can face. The townspeople have to learn to work together and overcome the difficulties in order to enjoy the advantages that life has to offer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Hi,  My name is Richard and I am a retired Marine.  I am writing about a movie that is a classic,  I was a young Marine in 1967,  when this movie came out.   I remember watching this movie with my Dad,  my Dad never liked movies.  We were on a mission,  and on the way home, we lost our way.  The only place I saw it was at the movies. I loved the movie,  it was really fun to watch.  My favorite scene was when  Sgt. "Cody" McInerney (Gary Sinise) saw a man who looked like the guy from the show "Sesame Street".   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is like a dream where you see the future. The story is good and a little disturbing but the way it is told is good.   I think that this movie is worth watching especially for people who like movies like Blade Runner but that is the only problem I had with this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the most entertaining and engaging movies I have seen in a long time. The story is a little cliched but it does have a good amount of action that keeps the pace up as well as some good gags. I feel it does a better job than the last two movies in keeping the tone down and letting the story play out as it should.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was watching the movie again the other day and I was very pleased with it. It was fun, funny, and filled with a lot of good acting and lots of action. It may be a little too long at about 100 minutes but that was not my main concern with this movie.   The story was pretty easy to follow, although it did have a few twists and turns at times.  The action scenes were pretty much everything you could ask for in a movie. I will admit I was not really a fan of the movie when it first came out. It reminded me of a lot I had seen on the tv show "Biker Mice from Mars" with a little more action, but I was still pretty pleased with the movie. There were a lot more characters to see, but they were all well developed. The movie is a great mixture of comedy and action, with a great story to go with it and an even better soundtrack to go along with it!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little disappointed at the beginning when I didn't like this movie a lot. The first few minutes of this movie are like watching a terrible sketch on TV, but it's not the sketch. I'm surprised this movie got a green light, though. I guess it's better than the other bad movies it's trying to imitate. The only thing I like about this movie is the ending. It makes a great point: when life becomes unfulfilling, we often find comfort in watching bad movies, like this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part about this movie is that it's so good that it could be a real cult classic.   I think this is one of the more underrated classics in the whole franchise. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so proud that a movie made me laugh out loud. I don't know what it is about the movie and it's story line that makes me laugh, it's about a girl named Shikabane who finds out that she is a clone of her great great grandmother. So of course a huge conspiracy starts going on and a group of scientists named Yudio and his assistant Kazuo come to try and find out who is responsible and how to stop it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My husband and I really enjoyed this movie, it was a very interesting movie, I think we enjoyed it a lot, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who has a good interest in the paranormal and the occult.   I don't understand why he took me to the movie but I was very excited to go and watch this movie because I love films like this about strange and strange events. I do agree with another reviewer that some of the actors did a good job but that was all I could do, I was really surprised at some of this things, this movie was so interesting to me because I knew there was something weird about it, so much I knew it was an illusion and not reality but the thing is there was a real feeling in it, and even though there was an alien and some paranormal things, all I really wanted to know was how this thing works and what is going on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A really enjoyable and well done movie.    The movie is about a man who goes into his late forties and decides to try a few different things. The movies starts out great with a man being a bit cranky about the weather. He goes to a beach resort and finds a hot girl he wants to marry.  After a few years together the two decide to move back home to be closer to their children.  Unfortunately a terrible accident takes place that takes the couple away from their lives for a short time.  The movie stays on course with a well written script that tells a good story.  This movie is a bit cheesy but it is entertaining to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie. It's a movie about a guy who has a bad week after he has an accident and when he goes to the hospital he is told he has a fatal heart condition and will not live. He decides to go for a run and when the running is over he notices that he has just heard someone call his name. He doesn't know what to do.   He can't keep his head up no longer and he decides to run after the call is made. This movie had a real creepy feeling about it. It was creepy to see a guy in a hospital call his own name and a big sign that said "Don't call me", and a guy with a big black wig walking around with a gun.  He decides he better go to a deserted place and wait for him to call for him and when it gets to about 30 minutes he hears a car coming toward him.  It turns out to be the police.  The story behind this movie is about a serial killer and he kills people on purpose.  This guy, whom the people called "The Chupacabra", kills people who don't deserve it and he can only live by the power of a man named Chupa who is a local priest and he also has a large gun with him. The people have to work together to stop Chupadabra. The movie had some great twists and was great to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good, entertaining, but forgettable action film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of the best of all time and I never thought it would be this good. It is a classic and is about a family that goes on a vacation.

The story was not too good, but that is not the point. The best part was the characters. I never had a problem with any of them. It is not a movie for everybody. It might not be the best comedy or drama ever. However, it is worth watching and will not disappoint you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a strong message, one of the things I admire in the world of fiction, that one can change things for the better. And one can be changed.   There's a big difference in the characters who come from the two sides of this movie.  It is clear that the main character is the man who wants to change for the best but in the end he realizes that it is not easy.  I enjoyed this movie very much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie.   There are so many good scenes.  One scene at the start is really funny, and I loved it.  It is hard to believe they took so long to make this movie, but the film is really fun.  As the film goes on, we meet new characters, we see a new side to the town, the film builds up to a real big finale.  I loved this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie in general. If you have never seen a good zombie movie, this is a good one to start with. It's not too long, but has a good mix of things to keep your interest. I would recommend this to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it. Very well done. I was glad the girl in the beginning went back to her old life (the one from her childhood in a small town) in the end, but I wish they had given us more details about the characters (I mean how the two of them met, how they met the rest of their crew, how their lives have changed). But I also liked the way the movie moved. And the movie didn't need to start at the beginning. The story was good enough to stand on its own, but the way it was set up was perfect.   "M.A.S.H." is a wonderful movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought it was pretty good. I was surprised when I saw that it's not really a superhero movie. It's more of a dark comedy with a bit of a story (though it was kind of hard to keep the story straight since I have no idea how a dark humor film works). It seemed more like a movie with a ton of laughs than a serious movie. I thought the humor was pretty funny but there were a few things that I felt were too hard to take at face value (for example when the hero is trying to save a dog, a dog that was only there for the camera and didn't say a single word to him... that is pretty funny) but it all worked out. I also thought the film played well with all the scenes in the bathroom. I did like how they kept the dark humor in it but they also kept the comedy in some scenes that could've been a bit too dark. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a very enjoyable movie. I don't even think I'll watch it again since the plot seemed too random to me. I was watching it thinking to myself that there are so many different people involved in this. But there wasn't any real chemistry. It seemed like everyone was just throwing around lines and there was no real character development. It was very bland. I'd like to think that someone took a shot at writing a good script and got away with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You get a movie like this in a perfect form for the time it was made. There's no music, which is fine, because it doesn't get that way for very long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this with a group of friends at a house show. It was a pretty good movie. I thought it was good. The movie is about a woman (played by Jennifer Aniston) who is in a terrible car accident with her son (played a pretty funny by Matt Damon). She gets back into the car and is able to stop. The car then breaks down again and she has to do another terrible car wreck (the most disgusting car wreck I've seen!). I thought this was a good first film for Jennifer Aniskin to work on because she is talented, and she doesn't have to act like a teenager all the time (though she does). There were some funny parts (the kid is so stupid sometimes), some good acting by all of the actors, and a good story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all good films, this one takes a while to get going. But once it does, its good to watch.

This was a great film all around and had me grinning all the way to the end.  When I saw the trailer for this I did not see any possible reason why I would like this kind of film. But I did and I'm glad I did!   I love this film and would not have been caught dead watching a straight to video version.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a movie lover, this movie has a lot to offer. The plot revolves around a group of students who are studying for the entrance exam to the prestigious A.I. Academy. The A.O.A., or "Artificial Intelligence Association," is a training school for "artificial intelligence," and they accept a new student, Kazuki, after seeing his mother's photograph on the news. After a day of training, Kazukio meets the mysterious female member of the A.A. called Ai. Ai introduces herself to Kazuki and explains that her role is to keep an eye on the other students and Kazuki. After Ai leaves Kazuki behind, Kazunio is suddenly picked up by a group who call themselves the "Garden" and are sent to the "Fountain" to become a gardener. Ai later reveals that she has kidnapped Kazun  This movie is an extremely well-done movie. It's a fast paced story that doesn't have much going on in the beginning, but by the end there is a great deal of information about the characters and plot. The story is rather short, which is a good thing as there isn't much to keep the audience interested, and the first half is fairly generic. There's no story that I can think of, but there are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting. The action scenes are also good, but you'll only see them when they're appropriate, and I'd say that there aren't many of those times in this movie. Most of the time they don't add much to the story, and sometimes they're even unnecessary. That being said, it still has a good story, good characters, and good animation. It may be short, but it's also very good, and worth checking out.  Helpful The AOA is just a fancy way of saying "A.I." The concept behind A. I. Academy is quite interesting. Instead of getting the normal "human" education, they give young humans the equivalent of a "computer AI." This machine learning is done via the most advanced AI program ever devised, the "O.I.," (Artificial Intelligent Institute) which is an artificial intelligence of immense power. A.J., one of the students at the academy, is recruited by Ai to be part of the Garden, a group formed to train the AIOs.Ai's goal is to use the Aio to create a world where
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a bit hard to understand at first.  There's a long section in the movie where the director is in a car, getting drunk with a woman who says "I was driving your car when you got your driver's license.  I got a good look at you and I fell in love with you.  You were the first real man I had ever seen."   So, I think there is something really funny about this whole movie.  The way he describes what he sees: the girl with big blue eyes, big round lips, a big hairy belly, big blue legs, and big blue jeans and a pink dress.  This movie is really funny.  Also, a little thing about this movie: the car he drives is a Corvette.   There's really no reason the movie is called "Don't Go Breaking My Heart".  If that were the case, the girl wouldn't be so funny, but since she's not funny, she's a bit more serious than the guy.  When she drives the car, I'm not sure if it's the tires or the steering that are going sideways, but it doesn't go much better for the girl.  She's more drunk than drunk and that's about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as a Christmas special on BBC one at about 1am this morning (UK time) and it's not quite Christmas yet but it is very very close!

The only thing I didn't like was the music, it wasn't too loud but not too quiet either, it really felt like someone had been in there with me.

The movie is good, however, the ending to the story is not as good as I thought it would be, which is the reason I gave it four stars instead of five.  It's not as scary as I wanted it to be, but it's still a good flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing you have to take into consideration about this movie is the fact that it was made by a woman.  It may not be the best, it may not even be the worst, but it's a woman's film and I can't say enough good things about it.   She has a nice sense of humor, a nice understanding of male and female roles, and she knows how to play the game.  She knows how many shots are in a scene and how to get the job done. She is also very beautiful and has a good sense of style.  It is sad to say but this is one of the best bad films I've ever seen, but the women are just perfect!   This movie is worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The script was very funny, the character played by Robert DeNiro was extremely well written and the ending of the movie was perfect, the camera shot that followed Robert De Niro in the street as he ran to catch the bus that he saw in the movie and his return to the bus was very beautiful and poignant.

My sister liked the movie, but i was really into it, also my mother loved it also. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a horror movie fan.   Horror movies are usually really cheesy and stupid, and you're expected to be entertained.  This movie is different.  It's about a little girl who has no idea of her own world and the fact that there are evil monsters around.  They live under a bridge, and they live there all year long.  And when you see them they're always moving about... I thought I was just being stupid for being so concerned with little ol' me.  When I saw the trailer I was excited and thought the trailer was really funny.  I was actually disappointed by the trailer.  The whole idea was that the monsters moved through the trees and there's no way the monsters could fit into a little old tree.  Instead the trailer had a huge group of scary kids running away from the monsters... I don't think they really believed the trailer and there was something really bad about the movie, like a nightmare come to life.  Then we get into the movie.  Like I said, the movie had a really bad trailer, but it still had a good idea.  These two kids are the only survivors of an evil monster that lives in the woods and is killing everyone.  We're led to believe that this monster is a young girl, which I thought was really stupid.  Well, she doesn't look much like a little kid and I think they could have gone with a little older character.  A lot of times kids grow up and change.  If the kid that the monster killed was a kid I would have been shocked.  But I guess they didn't see that the kids in the trailer were much too young for them.  Eventually we get to the point where the monster is killing them. It's a really cool concept.  First, we're treated to a little monster dance.  He's a dancer, and it's really well done.  Second, the monster puts two kids in his basket and takes them across the bridge to meet his family.  Third, we get a giant battle scene.  That's when they finally find out that there's really no monster.  One kid goes in a closet, and the other goes in the river.  Now, that's just creepy.  So they return to the bridge.  By this point we know that the little girl is not just a little little girl.  She's some sort of vampire.  At one point,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's been a long time coming, but I finally watched the whole movie in a single sitting and can now say that it is a pretty good film. I have never seen a movie so well written or well acted, and I like the idea that, in order to create an honest portrayal of real life, you need to put aside any preconceived notions. What we have here is a very good piece of fiction in which a couple of friends go on an afternoon hike to a lake in a forest in France. You might think that you see these friends as a bunch of dorks who like to wear funny hats and play cards; but no, no; this is a well-crafted comedy that I really enjoyed. It has a lot of action, a lot more laughs than one would expect from such a silly premise, and a good mix of the mundane and the ridiculous that will keep you chuckling until the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't really like this movie. It was a slow build up. It started pretty well, but the movie got really bogged down with the whole'snowclone' plot thing and it didn't get to the good parts until about the 3rd act.   For the movie it was good, but it lacked some of the good things that I liked about the original Snow Dogs (which is one of my favorite movies and probably the best American movie to come out of the 80's).   Also, the movie did get a little confusing towards the end (especially the movie version). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had heard that there was a sequel to the first one, but I didn't think the sequel was going to be as good as the first. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a good. This is not a sequel. It's a prequel. I'm not even sure how to describe it, but the movie is really funny, it's good action, it has a lot of sex scenes and it has the best special effects I've seen in a movie. If I was a teenager who wasn't afraid to do the things that teenagers do, I would have to say this is my favorite movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw a preview of this movie, and was excited about it, although my opinion is that it's a little cheesy and over the top, like many action movies of the 70's. It has a good cast of characters and interesting fight sequences. It's like a bad dream. There is a scene where this guy is in a fight, he shoots a guy (who dies) but he can't feel pain because he's dead. He's dead and his wife is dead and he's in a big fight with other guys (which don't have weapons) and he goes back to the other guy and punches him in the head and his head explodes, and the guy dies (I think the man had a heart attack from all the bullets that were flying around) and the fight is on a train track and one of the guys just stands there and says "what a bastard" to the guy who is on the track, he's really dead. This movie is a total waste of time, but at least I got to see some action.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story itself is good and well thought out. This is the sequel to the film, so it had all the characters, and was great fun to watch.

It reminds me of the old "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" and I love those old things. I also just saw "The Sound of Music" (1943) and it was amazing and I thought "The General" is like that, only better. It doesn't even try to be something that is not. It just is and it really is a great movie, it reminds me a lot of that movie and it also reminded me of how good a job Buster Keatons is doing on "Mr Rogers' neighborhood" and how he really did a fantastic job, too. I am just a sucker for a good old-style melodramatic melodrama that is just a great work. It was just perfect, it really was.      Posted by: Alan J. on June 30, 2009, 10:09:00 PM I'm pretty sure you are not even the first person to post this here. I saw the same movie about 6 years ago and still love it to this day. Just a great old-timey, good old fashioned melodrame. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had been reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn for years. It was one of the first things I ever read as a child. It stuck with me throughout my schooling, my college years and even into adulthood. This movie is one of those rare gems that really makes the film what it is. It's not going to be for everyone, but it's worth a watch. I'm still in awe at how an animated movie could capture the essence of the book without the aid of computers.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found myself feeling the emotions and it was a very beautiful movie.   This movie is very moving and it makes you feel like there is a part of you that is really there and this is something a lot of movies don't do.  In this movie there was a girl who is mentally ill and her sister who is a loving and caring sister who tries to help her but just doesn't have it.  This was a good way to watch a movie about the mentally ill.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this a long time ago, and I loved it.   It was a nice little tale, about the adventures of a little girl and her friends, who are lost in a forest after the woods man took their home.  When they get to a house, the little girl sees a giant who eats things.  She then tries to find his heart.  The story really got to me.  I've seen the movie a lot, and it's still one of the best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a couple of really great movies that have come out of the 1970s but the one that really stands out for me is the one about the first man to walk on the Moon. This is one of the first movies I saw in the 70s and was just a lot of fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well... I saw this at a movie theater where a friend and I went to see the new Batman movie on opening weekend. I never thought I would see such a good and funny movie. It is not that this film has too much comedy but it is not too heavy either, not a scene is too funny. This film has a great story line. It has a good story line about a kid who is so stupid he thinks that everything is a game to him and is only interested in the sport of football. I really liked the chemistry between him and his football coach, he is so close and honest that it is almost like a buddy film. This movie would be an awesome movie for a football movie fan, it is a funny and good movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on a Sunday night after a show at my local. This movie was not really "mature" at all. That is not necessarily bad. I just found it to be a somewhat boring movie, but I guess the premise is good enough to go on. I do think that this movie did a good job of making me feel something. That's the idea I get from it. So if you do feel something, this movie will give it to you.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character is a big goof and his goofiness is a nice contrast to the serious themes that the film tries to deal with. He has a wonderful time and his friend the bad guy really plays off the main character, and his character is definitely one of the funniest I've ever seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at work in front of the tv (on a cable bill with a "live sports" channel that is usually the only channel I watch on any day) when I turned to the movies, and what I saw scared me. I've had a few bad experiences with this director before, like "The Black Stallion", which was okay, and "The Wicker Man" which I thought was great, but what this one really scared me was that they could make this movie. I never saw a movie that was made like this one, not even "The Last House on the Left", and that was a movie made in the 70s, so a movie like this is almost impossible. In fact, this movie was made for a film festival in Berlin, and that's when all the actors, who had never done a movie before, got together and made a movie (which was like a horror movie, with a black background with the word "Killing" written in black, and the word that was written in white on a black field of black), and the director and the actors acted like they were in some dark movie, not a horror film, that's what I thought when I saw this. I thought that the director was trying to make some kind of movie that would be the horror of the 21st century, but he didn't. The actors acted really bad, the only actor I thought were decent was the "cute girl" who was very innocent, but she was also an actress, so she couldn't do much. I also thought that what was written was awful, but I thought the characters were really good. I found this movie scary, but the only thing scary was when the black thing appeared on the screen, and then the black shadow started running down the street, and I thought they were actually going to kill the "fool", but no, it turned out that the black things were actually people's bodies that were covered in a black film that was making them look like ghosts, but then the real thing appeared to kill them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A bit slow, and I'm not really interested in seeing a movie about a band of mercenaries that is forced to go on a quest of finding a mystical temple. I mean, it's the third movie of the series and it was kind of long, but it's not bad.   The special effects are pretty good.    It's a film that's set in a place where people are really into magic, and some of them want to become wizards (which they eventually are), and others are trying to join them.  That's why they're called wizards!   It's all a bit like "The Chronicles of Narnia", only much sillier, but I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best horror movie of the year:  There is a scene in this movie where a girl, an actress, is going to a performance and a man comes up behind her, puts a gun to her head and tells her to take off her clothes.  It's just creepy and scary and you feel like you are being watched and you can't do anything to stop it.  This movie is a good example of a well-done horror movie and it has good special effects.   I hope that the author of this movie will write more horror movies.

When i watched it i was not disappointed, if i could recommend this to everyone i would say watch this one cause its a really entertaining movie with amazing performances and a great script and characters to put it short a great watch  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie! It was pretty fun. The actors played their parts well. I was a bit confused as to why the police had to go out there to the trailer park to investigate the murder. They just did that.   A little too much time was spent on the story but it was nice to see the detectives do their job. The story did make a lot of sense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this a while ago, but only now found my time to review it. It's not really a horror, but the movie is actually very good. In the beginning we get a feeling of a bad movie that might not make anyone's favourite movie, but then something weird happens and the movie actually makes sense. This is a very good movie, and I recommend it for all people who like a good horror movie.    Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen a few movies this year that I have enjoyed a lot but none as much as I have for this. This is one of the best I have ever seen.   The movie starts with a nice intro and a bit of humor which was pretty good and is quickly replaced by an even more hilarious scene with a little girl that goes through an accident that causes her to fall and get into a ditch.  This poor little girl gets to run, run and run and the next thing you know she is in a pool. I was very confused by this and thought this was a movie about a boy who can't swim. The scene goes on and on with the same theme with some scenes that were hilarious and then some that were not.  The ending was also funny and not just because it was a girl who had a bad accident and ends up in a ditch, but also because the poor little baby doll who was in the ditch ends up not being so bad.  My only complaint is the ending, it could have been more funny and more appropriate for a comedy movie and not a horror movie.  Another thing that bothered me about this movie is how fast some of the scenes were done.  For a movie that is supposed to be a comedy it is so hard to keep it up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is an excellent adventure film with some great scenes, especially when the evil Dr. Mephesto (the greatest evil character in the history of cinema) is shown trying to capture the daughter of the hero, Dr. Geroge. This movie was made for a special audience, but it works perfectly.   The plot is simple, but very clever.  If you don't like adventure movies, you should check this movie out.  This movie does an excellent job at telling the story.  One thing I enjoyed about this movie is the way the heroine, the good doctor, was captured in an underground laboratory.  It would be impossible to escape.  What a great movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a very bad habit of only seeing the best movies ever made, and this is one of them!   It is one the best westerns I have ever seen, and I haven't seen anything like it.   Director John Ford, who is a very good actor himself, does his best work in this movie.  He gives this movie a real western feel, with the use of the western music, and the good use of special effects.  It also has a wonderful ending.  This is a must see for fans of the West. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really did not think I would like this movie, at all.   The plot is predictable, the acting is forgettable, the plot is just bad, and everything else about it is uninteresting.  And I can only guess that this is an old movie that was given a new life by a director that doesn't even look half-decent in his own film.  It is a good old tale about an incompetent police department, and a thief.  While a good detective story is good, this one is a train wreck that has no redeeming qualities to speak of.  If you can get past the stupidity, which is easily forgivable, this movie has a lot of potential, but alas, it is lost in the worst possible plot imaginable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was my first experience with the director, and I loved it! It's a great movie about two brothers who get married at the age of 19 in a small little town in Minnesota. They get a house together, they have a lot of fun, and they grow up quite quickly. The film itself is great! One can't help but smile at some of the situations they are in, such as when they go out to dinner for their 50th wedding anniversary and the guy asks if the wife ever had a threesome with him, or the time they have sex in the garage (oh the garage!) This movie is a must see for any lovers of classic movies!   The Good:  This movie has a great atmosphere, with a great soundtrack, good acting (especially for this time), and good writing. The story is quite unique, and gives a lot to think about.   The Bad:  The movie itself could have been a little bit better, but this is a well-written movie, and it has its moments. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a first time director, it really shows a lot of skill. He really shows his personality and how much he wants to be a director.   It really has a story to tell.  There's just a lot to say about this one.  It's a dark story.  For those who don't know,  the people in the film are very close to their own families.  The film centers on a family that decides to move from a small town to the big city.  They're a group of people, one from their parents, one mother and one father.  To start off, the father has a very hard time adjusting to his new home.  He has a hard time making friends.  Then, the mother tries to hide the son from her husband.  She even tries to get him to do things behind his wife's back.  One day, the young man decides to go off with his friends to the city for the first time.  Before they're really set off, his friend gets killed in a traffic accident.  When the young men get home, the son, who is really nervous about leaving home, breaks down and realizes that he's not alone.  In a sense, it's a psychological drama of trying to make a new life for your self.  We also get to see a lot about a family's dynamics.  From the father's inability to trust the young woman and his daughter, to the young girl's desire to see her mom.  At the end of the film, when we learn what happened, it seems like a little far-fetched to me.  But when you think about it, it does make sense.  I really enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The most popular of all the Star Wars films!   This is THE definitive collection of the four original Star Wars film trilogies in one great package.   You're going to be blown away by this one.  Star Wars is a great piece of fiction.  It has a good cast of characters and an even better plot.  For those with little knowledge of the original Star Trek: The Next Generation, it's a fantastic companion piece.  This book is a fun journey, that is packed full of surprises.  My only complaint is that the film isn't completely free of Star Wars/Trek influences.  The entire film is shot on 70mm film, and the cast members look fantastic.  These are very impressive images, especially the opening shot of the Death Star exploding, complete with the sounds of the torpedoes.  And the ending is similar to the end of Return of the Jedi, except I don't get the sense of an ultimate good versus evil.  I get the feeling that the Death star and the Imperials are simply trying to kill everyone.  Sure it's an alien invasion, but in a way it seems more personal.  Some of the characters seem more like stereotypes, others more like the real deal, but everyone is still very enjoyable.  There are some amazing shots in the film, most of which aren't just scenes of destruction.  If you've seen the films, you'll be right at home.  One of the best Star Wars stories ever told. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is about a scientist who lives on a farm in the country and is experimenting on different strains of grass. He accidentally kills a baby, who is also a part of the experiment, and the people he works with try to help him out of it. This is a pretty good story with a little bit of comedy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was an enjoyable movie.  It is a dark humor based film about a father who goes back in time to save his son in a story with a father-son relationship.  The father is a retired police chief who now works as a bus driver.  He also drives the school bus and this leads to him being very involved in the lives of his students.   I loved the story about a police chief (John Malkovich) who goes into the past in order to save a young boy (Michael Ironside) who was kidnapped in the past and has been raised by his mother.  My only problem with the film is that it is a little slow and that Malkovich is a very good actor who is always effective and entertaining in his work.  This movie is a must see.

They even get in some fun shots." -The Cineplex Review
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a way, The Exorcist was my favorite movie of the summer (it was pretty good, but I think it's better in the long run as a movie). As for the storyline, it's about a group of priests who run the "Bible" in a New York convent. One of the characters, Father Bedeckt is the only priest who does not believe in the existence of a demon (that's why he is called "Bedecktor"), he believes there is an otherworldly entity that is responsible for the death of a nun. The Exortican, a sort of evil spirit, has taken a young girl (Lauren Bacall) and is holding her captive. At one point, the priest tries to exorcise the Exorciste to make the Exortician leave and leaves to find the other priests. The film has one of the most beautiful set pieces I've seen in a long time, with the priest in a large wooden box (the "exorcist" is locked in a cage). The Exoriste is released by the priests and kills Lauren Bacall. At the end, when the Exorist is trying to leave the box, he is turned into a small child by an unseen force. The girl comes to see the boy, but is attacked by the Exocite. She runs away and the priest helps the boy to escape.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this film in the theater on a rainy day. The rain was coming down and it was a pretty dreary film. I thought I would enjoy a rainy morning with a movie about a girl who fell down a flight of stairs and broke her neck. It looked like a bad nightmare I would never forget. The girl was named Molly. She was a little girl and she was walking down the stairs and she had no problem getting down. The camera would pan down her long black hair as she did. Then she was falling. The scene was horrible! I don't remember much but I remember a bunch of blood and lots of blood. It was just too horrific to be believable. I have a lot of pictures of the scene from the movie but I don`t remember if there were any close ups or if they are still in my collection.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The film is about a family that tries to make a new home for itself after a devastating hurricane. Their new home is made of old wooden boards, but once the kids start living there, they learn to make things from wood too."    The cast and crew of the movie are terrific.   They do a great job with the story line.  They made it about a normal family that gets displaced because of a storm and their new home. It doesn't matter to me if the family is displaced or if they make new homes.  I loved it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is actually really intriguing.   It shows that if you use your brain you can come up with some crazy stories that may shock you or make you think.  You can really feel the shock that this guy's father has put him through, and the story takes a more personal turn when the father himself is taken away.  After being away from home for 5 years the kid is able to have his own little life, but it becomes even more interesting when the guy's family starts getting in on the game. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born and raised in the Southern United States, and the South is an amazing place to live. And you know how everyone is always talking about the food, and what's not to like about a "great" Southern restaurant? This is one of the greatest places I've ever been to. It's a little bit of a drive from Houston but you get to a beautiful and serene location with a spectacular view. The food is so good and so easy to eat; not a bad thing at all. The price is fair, and this is the kind of place I always have on my list. The music in the restaurant is also a wonderful thing to listen to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's just that the movie is not that good.  I was expecting it to be pretty good but after watching it for the third time I can't say I was that impressed.   I thought the cast was all really nice and the special effects were really cool.  However, as soon as we get to the movie we start to notice that we're watching a made for TV movie.  The film was just so bad that I don't know if it could have been better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is about a couple of old men who lived on an isolated island on the far west of France, during World War I. There they became friends with a French girl named Maud. Maud and her friend (the young American) Henry take a vacation to the islands when she meets a man who is going to be staying with them. Mert is the one who becomes the focus of the movie. Mervyn (Maud) has been a soldier since the age of 18. When the war ended Mervy left the army, but it was not very pleasant leaving the regiment and seeing that she has lost her husband in battle. Now she has been put on a ship which takes her to the big cities of France. It is here that she meets some strange people. She falls in love with a Frenchman named Roland who seems to be a very good guy, but she never sees him again. She soon gets involved in some serious crimes that begin to turn against her.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A short but effective story, with a hint of humor.   I enjoyed the movie because it was a good story, very well told, and had a good, albeit short, ending.  The story is told from the POV of a man who's name is Richard.  His life is quite boring, as he works in a boring job and lives with a boring wife and his annoying children, who don't do much to make him happy.  He has a problem, however, one that he is trying to solve, a problem that he calls his "problem" and the "problem," itself, is a problem of a large number of people. He is a good man, but his problem doesn't seem to be that big.  Unfortunately, the more he tries to solve the problem, the less he can think of anything else to do with his life. He realizes this is the problem with which the world faces every day; it's a problem we're always trying to think about, to solve.  And he realizes this can't be a problem unless there is a solution, which there isn't, for all the solutions have been found and they're just getting harder to find.  But it's not really a problem at all; it seems to be a "problem of our lives" - a problem whose solution is as elusive as its creator.  The movie ends with this statement about how he will eventually find a solution.  At this point in the movie, the audience is thinking, "How many times do I have to say that? That guy is a genius." The man is a great man, no doubt about it, and he has a lot of ideas that will solve the "Problem of our Lives" in a variety of ways.  You don't have to be crazy to have a great life, though, so the movie doesn't really have to convince you about the man's genius, but it does have to make you feel that he can make it work.  I'm not sure if this is a typical movie ending, though.  One of the things I don't like about movies is that they never end, and I think that is why we tend to not like them, because they feel more like we're watching someone's life go by than a real movie.  This ending does make me feel like I was watching a real life story.  What do I mean by that?  I have no idea. I thought

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The film makes a good fist of this genre: a man with a brain full of bizarre and interesting ideas that never quite make it into the right place. The film has been done before, and the execution is almost perfect. The movie is worth watching to see what this guy does and see what his ideas are. The best thing about it is that it is a comedy.    If you want to see an interesting idea in a low budget film, pick this up." - The Independent

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a little too short and simple in its theme and premise to be considered a classic.   The plot is a good one, with a nice ending but it doesn't go into deep or interesting subject matter and it isn't scary at all, although it does have a good concept and you can imagine it could be scary to a child.  For its time it is very interesting, and I loved the characters and the situations.  A great movie to have in a rainy night. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the best thing that I have seen since  The Great Escape.  The characters are so real.  Even though they are in a movie where a guy tries to save a girl from a gangster's (an idiot) revenge plot, you still see them as real people who are very likable.    I really liked this movie.  I think a lot of people would like it too.

This is a good example of a well made movie that is a solid movie!   It's fun, dark, creepy, and has a great score.   There's just a bunch of people that seem to hate on the town.

One of those films I see as a kid in the local cinema that you have to see to fully understand what you just saw.  It's also a shame they couldn't do something a bit more original - a girl who wears a wig? Not a good idea.  I was expecting a lot more from a film called Tickle Me Pink; the only thing that it managed to accomplish was to make a lot of kids cry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story itself is actually quite interesting and is more focused on two main characters rather than just a group of characters fighting to the death. The story does delve into the politics of the world and is a little confusing at times with the people in the story, and the character names seem out of place for the story. I thought the end of the film was fairly good, but there was a moment where the characters and the viewer are shown in a very close up with only a quick shot of the characters mouth being shown. The ending was very much a conclusion, but rather than the characters just standing around being sad or angry, I felt like this was a rather sad and depressing movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought "Man on Wire" was a great movie! It had great actors (John Huston) and a great plot! John Huston played the bad guy really well! I thought it was a very well-made, great movie, and I think it will be a classic! I wish John Hust's character, "The Man on Wire", had been played by a better actor! The last 25 minutes were a bit of a mess and it was hard to follow. I didn't like how he talked so much and used long worded sentences. He wasn't as likable as I thought he should be! The final plot twist was a bit hard to believe and a bit cheap! He talked about a very small amount of material that had very little to do with anything else in the movie. But, if I wanted to hear him talk about nothing but the things he really wanted to say in the beginning, I could watch a whole movie of it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. It does not feel like it is about a person or a group. It feels like a movie made by a person (not a group) with a certain mindset.   There are times when the characters feel like a bunch of old white guys from the south.  They have no respect for anyone. They want to be in charge and have all the power.  It was a very depressing movie but I found it to be interesting and enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched it again yesterday because I was bored and didn't want to watch any of the rest of the movies in the series so I decided to check out the film again. I've only watched the film once before and it was the last movie in the entire series. It is about a little boy and his father. They have a beautiful son named Fred who they take to the desert to be trained in the art of survival. The boy is quite intelligent and gets along well with his father although there are tensions between them. It's quite a funny movie with a good sense of humor. One day the boy's father and his friends decide to take a break in the desert and when they arrive the boys sister isn't with them. As a result they go on a wild goose chase to find her and they stumble upon a secret military training camp. After a while of this we end up with a military officer who is the head of the camp and he's a bit of a jerk. The kid's father has a crush on a certain woman and he thinks she looks like his sister. He tells his father and then he tells the girl who he's feeling for. Now the man is very jealous because the man's daughter has the heart of a tiger and he'd like to take his place.   When it comes to the ending of this movie it's a very disappointing ending that never had me believing they could end the story this way. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but I wouldn a liked to have seen the rest. I have to admit I liked it when I first watched it and I really did like the movie. This is a funny little story about a father and son that goes to a training camp and ends up in the middle of the desert. I think it's only a movie but I can't help but love it and think it should be seen more often.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An old fashioned adventure, filled with funny, well thought out and executed scenes. The humor is more like the "Goodfellas" films, with a little "Fistful of Dollars" thrown in, if you haven't seen the classic (and the only American made) movie with James Cagney in the role of Joe Gilligan.   The story itself is fun to watch, and has an interesting plot and some strong character development.  The acting is good.  For all those who like good old fashioned, fun action movies, "The Great Train Robbery" will appeal to you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a remake of a cult classic movie by the same name.  The concept of the movie is very similar to that of the original.   I don't think I have seen a better movie that has been made since The Sixth Sense and I have to say that the whole story has a very eerie vibe to it.  There are some very weird scenes in the movie that will leave you wondering and that's why I think this is a must see movie.  I really don't see what could be wrong with this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished watching the film, and was amazed by this movie. It has a great story line and a unique plot. The characters are well defined and their actions all fit into a plot. It does not take itself very seriously, and that is good. One of the main characters is a bit annoying but still seems to be a likable person. The story is very unique and good. It may sound a bit corny but it is very well put together.   This is an excellent movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like my review of   The Big Chill   It is hard to believe that such a great movie was produced.   From the time I saw it in the theater until the time of viewing a second time, I was amazed at the fact that this movie had a plot, and could be made as good as it was.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves action movies, or for people who like action films and comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not sure how to rate this one because at first I was a bit disoriented by the movie, not because it was bad (because there are a lot of good movies in this genre, such as this one) but because the action felt a little like a fast paced western. But it really isn't. I was surprised when I found out the title of this movie, because it wasn't very descriptive or descriptive at all. However, I found this movie very enjoyable and very realistic.   One of the best movies I have ever seen.

The movie has a great atmosphere and is full of tension and horror.  I didn't like the ending in which all of the actors got a bunch of plastic bags and a garbage can and tossed the stuff over their heads.  This was a good action film and I recommend it to any horror movie fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really wanted to like this movie. I thought it was pretty cool when I first heard it a few years ago. I was even thinking at one point that it might be a little like the movie "Shark Tale" when the protagonist has a dream about a shark. But then I got to see it.   The movie is made of a lot of special effects and very convincing. The actors were all great and I liked them all very much. I really enjoyed the movie.  The only problem I had was that the movie seemed to have an awful lot of commercials. I felt like I was watching a lot more commercials than a movie should have.  I would like to recommend this movie to everyone, and I think it is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In order to show what a great director John Milius is, I'll say that he is a master at characterizing the human characters as people you don't want to be around and yet you find yourself wanting to know what happens next.   As in a good old fashioned movie like "The Wild One," there are two main characters who are given a choice of two ways of going to the end of their lives.  These two men have a lot in common in their personalities, their family and their upbringing.  Their fathers and mothers were both drug addicts and in prison so they inherited their problems, their attitudes, and they are a lot like one another.  In addition, both men have had to kill a lot of people.  But what makes it different is the fact that they are on different sides of the law.  For John Millaus, he is the person that you would think would kill himself in prison because of the guilt that has been put upon him.  His family members have gone down the path of killing as well.  John Millius is also the man who is trying to get his life together. He is a smart guy who is determined to get the truth about what happened to his son.  Unfortunately for him, he gets his hopes up too soon.  This movie is a fast one that moves quickly.  We are also introduced to two other people that are being interviewed and one of these people is a local politician.  At the end, you think to yourself "I wonder if they're telling the truth."  For what I know about John M. Milias, I think you can be sure that he's a smart and a good guy but sometimes you get a little tired of his behavior.  A really good thing about this movie is that it is told from two different points of view.  The first is Millaius, and the second is the local politician who is talking to him. They are both a little on the thin side.  It's good to see how well done John Milaus is at portraying his characters.  One of my favorite parts about the movie is how they have a very accurate portrayal of the drug culture and the culture of the prison.  I like to think this movie would be more entertaining if they could have just gone into the prison and talked to the prisoners.  Another thing that I thought was great about the film was the ending.  As you read the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie as a gift for my husband a couple of days ago and it was a good gift. I thought this movie was great, like I said it was fun, but also a little scary, like a little horror movie I would recommend to kids who want to see a scary movie. The kid is not really scared he is just a good kid, and they make a good family, and you can't not like this movie you have to watch it. The little boy is a very happy little boy, even though he may seem a little cranky to us adults, he is still a good boy, he's just a bit cranky sometimes...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is like a fantasy, a fairy-tale, and a magic tale. It is about a young woman who is transported to another world and finds there is a man who has the power to make people come alive.   I saw this movie several times. The first time I was in high school and I was amazed at how it changed me to the point that I became a Christian in two weeks. It was so profound that I could not believe it and I have not seen it since.  It has become my favorite movie of all time and I can never watch it without crying. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, thank you for giving this movie a chance! I didn't even have a clue what to expect of a movie from an author who is best known for "Hercules: the Legendary Journeys."  I watched it with a good buddy of mine and we watched it twice in the theater and didn't get bored at all.  The script is well-written and easy to follow.   The characters are well-rounded, they're all likable and enjoyable to read about.  Even though the film is over 20 years old, it still holds up remarkably well.  It's a good family movie that should be a movie for any family.  I've heard some complaints about the actors and the acting isn't up to par. I don't feel that the actors are terrible, but I do think they did a decent job.  They do get to shine in the scenes that are very touching and emotional.  What can I say about the effects?   It looks beautiful, and the special effects are wonderful.  To sum it up, a great family movie, and a great movie that will appeal to any fan of the Hercules films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very well-made movie. There are several points in the film that give a more-than-adequate explanation to the movie. The story is a great example of how a bad director could make a good story into a truly entertaining one. A must- see movie for fans of science fiction, action movies, action-oriented movies, and sci-fi movies in general. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My parents were divorced when I was very young and I was taken in by one of my cousins who was living with her mom in the old part of town. I don't remember much of the day as I was really young and there was no school so I had to play outside until someone dropped me off at a corner of the road where they let me drive around until I found a place to stop to eat. It was a fairly normal day in my neighborhood but this place had a real unique feel to it. I remember there was a street sweeper that lived by a trash can which he sold a couple of bags of trash and all the garbage cans along that street had a little door at the top and there were a few people out in front of the street selling fruit for a dollar or a dime. It had a very old fashioned feel to the place with the old men sitting out on their stoops talking to each other and occasionally walking around. The place was called a 'downtown' and the old women looked like they were trying to make a go of the old place. The kids were everywhere and they were really curious about what was going on down there and they wanted to come out and help themselves. One day a couple kids came down to play and they asked one of the older women if there was any room in the back for a little boy. She asked them if they were new and they said no so she brought them in and put them in the small room next to the garbage can. The boy went to his bedroom and there he saw a woman that looked like she lived there and was holding a little basket that was full of potatoes. They asked the woman what was in the basket. She replied that there was potatoes in the front and a few other things in the rear. They thought that was odd so one of them asked her what they were and she told them they were fresh. They were really hungry and she asked them to take a handful of potatoes and eat them all while they watched the potatoes grow. The one little boy didn't want to take any because his mom was still in a rush to get out of the house so he asked his sister if she wanted to eat the potatoes and she said she was too hungry to eat them. He asked his brother if he wanted to see how they grew and he said he wanted too. He took a handful and ate all of the potatoes while he watched them grow. They didn't look too bad but then his mom

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really love this movie. It's kind of like a science fiction horror film about an alien abduction movie with a female lead. There's a bit of a romance with a man who's got a very strong physical appearance. It is very interesting to see this type of alien abduction scenario played out on film. This was my third alien abduction film I've seen, and this was my second experience with these alien abduction scenes. I was very impressed with the way the movie was presented. I felt like it was well edited and well shot. The movie wasn't over the top with it's acting and story line, which is really nice to see, especially when this kind of stuff is happening to a bunch of high school girls.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a little boy, my father showed me his favorite movie, "The Three Little Pigs". I can still remember the scene where three pigs were playing hopscotch and the announcer said: "They get so high, they just can't see the ground."   In a funny scene, a baby was playing peek-a-boo with a pig and, after they noticed that she wasn't falling off, they began a conversation: Baby: What are you, a pig? Pig: A pig? Baby: A baby pig. Pig:... Well, I'm a baby pig...   It was such a cute movie, that I want to share it with my children too.     My wife loves this movie, too. "The Three Wise Men", a movie about three wise men who have their eyes on Jesus. It is a short and sweet movie. The movie begins with a short scene of Jesus' birth.  A group of three wise guys are walking on a hill.  This is followed by a long scene of three blind men walking in a blind man's life.  It ends with the three wise dudes walking on the top of the hill. One of the wise dudes is going to tell Jesus about all the good things he does, and Jesus is going, "I can't believe you would make me believe so much" and then the movie ends.  " The Three Wise People: Three wise guys, who have seen all the great things, have their thoughts of Jesus, and as they walk up the hill they see him and say: "Look what He has done." It is not long until one of the three smart guys is going "Well, I can't wait to tell him that. I have the gift that He has made possible." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, there are a lot of good movies coming out this year. There are some that I think are really good. But then there are some bad ones too. There's the usual cliche bad movie, and then there's the not-so-usual bad movie. One of those is The Devil's Own. I don't know if it's as bad as the reviews made it sound, but it's not good, or at least I didn't enjoy it much. The story is that a scientist was experimenting with something that would allow him to travel back in time. So he went and got a bunch of old cars and a boat and he did a lot experiments and ended up being really good at everything except time travel. Then he went back in the past and got some really bad car accidents and ended in the hospital. The doctor that he talked to is like his son. I found that a bit odd. There isn't any real tension in this film. You don't care what happens because it's too predictable. The bad things never seem to get worse than before. The good things just get better. I suppose I'd rather watch something like this than a movie like a remake of Dracula.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film. This is one of those movies that you watch over and over again just to remind yourself that this movie was made in the 60's and 70's, and I feel that it's a classic. The music is pretty good, and it's not bad at all. I found that when watching it I often found myself going back to my old movies. This movie could have been better, but the characters are all pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie reminds me a lot of the ones that I used to watch on TV on a loop when I was little. But it's different in that it's a family movie. It's like a really fun family movie made by a woman who is able to put a lot more heart into it. A lot of good things happen in this movie: The kids are all in good cheer (even when there's a little mishap) and the whole thing is kind of a family affair. It just keeps building, and building, but I'm not sure what exactly the big payoff is. It really doesn't feel like one. It feels more like a movie where the kid has to take a little time to find his place in the world, and then he does.   I guess this movie is more about children's emotions than anything else. It tries to portray what a child is, but not in a way that makes them feel as if they are some kind of freak, or that they're a special case. It paints a picture that everyone experiences, but it doesn't really get down to the bone of what a kid is. The characters are very funny, but that's about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of Michael Cimino.   He is my favorite director of all time and   I have enjoyed his work every time.    When I heard that he would be making a movie about a group of thieves, I was very excited about this.  It was a good thing that he gave the cast a wide array of ages and looks so they would have a wide variety of people to play with.  The movie is a bit cheesy at times and is also a bit silly, but overall a very enjoyable movie.  As far as acting goes, I liked the cast, especially Jack Nicholson.  His character is a big jerk and I am surprised how long he has been working.  I really enjoyed how they all played their parts and it was well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't really like the first one, the sequel is even more mediocre.    I like the girl, but I also thought the story and plot didn't work.   The first movie took place in a high school, this movie took places in a small town.  I never really understood the first movie until the second one.  There are a lot of characters, but nothing important happened to the characters.  The storyline is about a group of high schoolers who all go to the same high school.  Their only difference is that the first school is where they live.  A lot of things happened to them in the first.  These high school students never made a lot out of highschool.  It seemed as if everything they wanted happened.  This is a very low rated movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As if this review isn't long enough to make it very clear why this movie deserves the 5-star rating, I'm not sure why I wrote it at all: I didn't find this movie too bad. Sure, there are some weak jokes in the beginning that were a bit too over the top, but those quickly disappear after a while and you are rewarded with a fairly decent movie. This is not a movie that's going to appeal to everyone, but I'm sure there are people who will enjoy this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie really is a masterpiece! I'm always fascinated by the way people can go from being quite literally naked in the forest to being totally naked, and then back to being quite again... It was pretty obvious at the time it was released that the actors were getting paid a lot of money, so to have a movie like this made by a couple of guys on a no budget budget (it has a $5,000 budget!) with no acting in it, and a bunch of naked ladies who all have names was just the icing on the cake! And then when they did their acting, I knew we'd have something here that was quite truly great. The acting is just so wonderful that I just wish I could have seen it at the cinema!   It is a real treat to watch it again!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is very well done, and a good idea.   If you are a fan of old school thrillers, or even good comedy, this one should be on your must-see list!   This is the first installment in a two-part series called "Dead Man's Shoes," and it was directed by a man who knows how to use a camera. He takes us through the events of the night of the crime and the aftermath with a sort of dreamy quality to the filming and a great deal of tension and suspense.  There are several moments where you will be shocked or even giggle out loud at how great the performances are, even if you don't understand what is going on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to thank the writer/director/actor/producer, Tony Curtis, for the excellent use of dramatic material and his use of the material to help us understand the situation of people in the past and to help them to understand those times and place in which they lived. This is not a film about the past, it is about the present and about what we do with the present.   (...) The film is about a man who lived through a long period of warfare in Ireland in the mid 1800's. I do not believe that most people today who grew up during this period would be able to understand the conflict because it was not about war but about religion and how people perceived themselves and their relationship to one another. This film is a powerful presentation of what war can do to people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The one who wrote this review   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdZ_Zm6Z9-I&feature=share   "This is a well-constructed, well-acted, well directed and well-made movie.   As expected, the main characters are well acted, as their plot is very simple yet interesting, with a very strong script by the writer of this movie. This is a good start to a well acted and interesting movie. It is my recommendation to anyone who is looking for a good thriller, with great action scenes and suspenseful scenes."   This movie is about the life of a rich man who has inherited his ancestors' estate in the small town of New England. He has to live in the old farmhouse for a while and he starts to fall for a pretty farm girl, Emma. His life is a disaster and he goes crazy. This story starts when his house is broken into by a gang who is after his money. He is forced to go into hiding and he has to fight his way through his crazy life. This movie has all the hallmarks of a great thriller: it's fun, has a very nice script, with lots of plot twists and a good script writing, plus some very good acting. This would be a great movie to watch after watching a good old Western. It's an enjoyable movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie!   I am not going to review the movie as i would say that you should see it for yourself.   The movie follows an ex-police officer and a criminal called a 'hoochie' named 'Pigsgy' (who i know has only a few lines) as he tracks down the man who took his wife and he must do what any good policeman would do in the same situation.    The film has a great deal of action but it's so well directed that you don't notice what's going on.  The plot is very well drawn out and there is a lot of tension to keep you wanting more.  A great little movie to enjoy with a good story that's also good at heart.  Recommended for a good, fast paced and well thought out film.

The Wizard has always been a favorite of mine and I have always loved the characters from Oz.   So when The Wizard opened I was a little nervous to see what the cast was going to be.  I was so surprised to see how well it held up. The movie is in black and white and looks great. It is very dark and dramatic which is perfect for a dark fantasy movie.  When the actors do a scene or a scene-over-scene it is amazing and not a lot is actually happening. It's just a lot of action scenes and that is it.  This movie is also very good at making a lot out of very little.  The characters are well written and very relatable. They even make a few references to old stories.  It is a very good movie and one of my favorites of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Great movie about how it feels to be an artist in America at the end of the century. I enjoyed it!   I liked the way this movie was shot with a modern look to it. It didn't seem like a modern movie at all. I had the feeling that it would take place in the 20's and 30's. The ending, when the character and her partner leave on the train, I felt like the ending was a little forced because I don't know that they ever left.   It was just a very nice, relaxing movie, with a very unique theme.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the idea of this movie; its very interesting. The idea is that some people with "superhuman" abilities can only remember one thing at a time and that there are some people that are completely blind, deaf and in a state of perpetual blindness. I've heard a few different stories about this, but it's actually not all that bad. I like that these people are completely dependent on others. They are too stupid to actually do things on their own. They rely on those around them for survival. When one of these people is hurt, they are usually paralyzed, deaf or blind; so there is a limited amount of help and comfort to be had. If the person in question isn't dead, they usually end up in an insane asylum. In the case of those who can't be saved, there are all sorts of other problems such as being unable to walk without assistance or see. In some cases the blindness is permanent; in others it's temporary. The film is quite scary, but I think that it is probably more so about the people than the story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really didn't think much of this movie as it has nothing to do with me. As I got older and moved into an area of the country where I grew up, I became a little more aware of what my ancestors went through. This movie has a couple of interesting points that I really liked and was a fun watch, but not enough for a watch this when I have a family gathering later this week.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Somewhere between The Godfather, The Godmother and The Devil's Advocate, John Sturges' Man on the Moon is the perfect example of what film-making can be. The first thing to know about the movie is that it is not really about any of the men in the movie but rather about the women. It's the sort of story that seems to be a no-brainer for a movie, which makes it even more disappointing to discover that the movie itself is a little less than perfect." --Cameron Thomas ( The Chicago Tribune ) "What's more, Sturges was at the height of his powers in this film, a director who could create images that were more like visions than impressions. In his hands, film images came alive with the power and immediacy of a new-born child. The movie was not necessarily a work of art, but it was as visually compelling as it was emotionally engrossing. It had the atmosphere and excitement of a science fiction movie and was, with its use of special effects, a true film noir." --Kurt Vonnegut ( The New Yorker ) "It was the ultimate in a long line of American films that came to be known as the Great American Novel." --John Steinbeck ( The Atlantic ) "The film was simply extraordinary... The most fascinating American film I've seen in years." --Michael Wilson ( The Hollywood Reporter ) "One of the best films to come out of Hollywood in years, as close to a modern classic as one can hope for." --Sandy Cowell ( The Village Voice ) "A masterful drama of the soul and the human spirit. John Sturge's Man on Moon is a film that must not be missed. " --Richard Matheson ( The Los Angeles Times ) "There is a scene that makes you cry. John F. Sturges's first film about women, and the first truly emotional film in his career... Man on M.U. is a superb and moving film. A great film." --Robert Altman ( The Nation ) "If ever there was a film like this in the history of America, that will live on in the memories of those who witnessed it...a classic in every way." --Dorothy Parker ( The Evening World ) "I have a feeling that Sturges had some deep-seated and deeply-felt convictions about the relationship between men and women. This film was a reflection of these beliefs, and its messages
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Good :   I am a big fan of the series, and this movie is as much of a sequel as it is a prequel, and there are few things that can make a prequels worth your time.   They give a good explanation of the events and what they mean in the series.  I'm not a big sci-fi fan, but this movie definitely does it justice and makes sense.  It's a fun movie.  The Bad :   This film is very long, at nearly 4 hours.  There is a good amount of special effects, but I felt the characters had a little too much exposition.  Not too bad, just didn't click.  Also, one of the characters says something that was completely out of character for him (i.e. his "I can do anything I put my mind to" is completely off.  This movie does not have enough humour, which is always my main complaint about sci-fis.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a big fan of the genre, especially horror. I have seen a lot of them over the years and I think it is the most interesting and frightening genre I have ever seen. The movie was great as usual and I do have to give a rating of a 5. I will definitely see more of the movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie.   The plot is very unique, as it features a man in a wheelchair and a woman who lives on a boat.  The movie is set in the early 1900's, where they both live on boats. They have different jobs, and the man in the wheelchair has a very bad leg, and so he can not walk and get out of the way to get to the water on a certain day, and on that day he is seen by a sailor (an amazing person) who takes him home, where he lives for a couple of months.  I am very sad to see that this is the last movie I will be seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie was really good, the sound was great, the story was great and the movie itself, well I mean it was pretty good.   At the end of the movie, the guys are walking across a field and then all of a sudden they look down the field at a black cloud.  This black cloud looks like a man and a woman are in a boat and they are making their way across a lake.  They are dressed in black and they have their hands over their faces.  I loved this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can only assume that the producers of this movie, the makers of a real movie, did the right thing in casting the star of this film and in real life this is a guy who is as good as can be. I wish I could go back and not see this movie now, but I have watched it all the way through.   Like a good story should do, it puts together a good, good story which is about a real American, a real boy, who happens to be about the same age as the actors who played him.  But, he is no hero and he is not even a normal boy.  It is sad to watch a boy, be so full of himself that he has no idea what he is doing and the world is in his hands because he can't stand to watch another boy get a little stronger and better, and he doesn't want to have to get up and go outside and do the things a boy should do.  There were a couple of things in this movie that made me laugh out loud.  In the beginning of the movie the kid who is supposed to be so normal and likeable gets into a fight with his mother because the mother wants him to put away a knife that his brother has given him. This is a boy who has a knife at all times, and because he had the knife so frequently and so quickly, he was able to pull it out at will.  The second thing was in the part where he is watching a movie on TV. At the end of this part when they are all in bed in their bed, the boy pulls the movie up on the TV set to show them all and then he starts laughing hysterically. I thought that was really funny.  Also in one of the movies the girl that is supposed the wife of the star gets into it with her sister, and the brother of the girl. When I was watching this part I thought it was a lot like the first part when the mother and brother were talking to each other and I thought to myself that they were talking about the girl and she didn't look like a woman.  I guess, but that is just what I thought and I don't know any woman that looks like that, and I sure didn't have any mothers or brothers to compare her to.  So, I don' t know how a person can look like that and not have a normal family, but it seems like if a person was born with it
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a nice movie. I liked this movie, it was well written. It took a good look at what is wrong with the American mind, especially in the way we treat women.   The writer, Paul M. Sammon, writes about this film from a female perspective.  The female characters were very likable and well written and the male characters were interesting and well rounded.  I liked that this movie was funny and had a good story and the whole cast and crew made the movie so good that you would love to watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I have never seen a movie like this. We sat on the edge of our seats waiting to see if this was the real thing. And we were not disappointed at all.   This film was a real shocker to both me and my wife, who was expecting a typical action/adventure film.  As we sat back and watched the movie, we were amazed at the realism of the film. For the most part, the movie portrayed a realistic portrayal of an alien being that lives in the woods on earth. They can not walk or talk on this earth, but they do what they can. They hunt and they are very violent. This is an alien that was born on the moon that has lived there for a very long time. The thing that was most amazing about this alien was the fact that it is very intelligent. The aliens have their own language, that is very easy to understand. It was a surprise to me that this alien had such an amazing intellect that we are able to understand his words and even know what he is saying. I have to say, when this movie was over, I was left completely satisfied.  The aliens in this movie were very believable and I was impressed at what they did.  So if you are looking for a good aliens movie, look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie thinking it might be a re-telling of a movie called The Matrix. However, after watching it, I realized that it wasn't really a movie at all. I think it was a novel. It's a novel that's kind of like a short story about a robot and a woman who are being pursued by a group of people who want to take a special substance called MIND and turn them into a living god. This isn't a bad story, it's just bad written. I found that there were just too many words used that I had no idea what they were actually saying. In the end, it just got old and the action in the movie wasn't exciting either.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is pretty interesting with a lot of different ideas but still keeping it under the cover of mystery with good use of music. There were times I just lost track of time and what we were seeing. And I was right in front of a couple of really interesting scenes and some really awesome special effects. But I was a little confused with the ending and how I got there. The ending was a bit weird and did not make much sense. But that could be because the movie has a lot in it that does not make sense, but for a thriller this one was really good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very disappointed in this movie.   It wasn't a bad movie, but it was pretty average compared to most Hollywood films.  The acting was decent, but I did feel a little cheated out of being able to see these 2 people getting to know each other.  I thought the plot was interesting and they did a good job of showing that.  A couple of jokes I did not think were funny at all.  It was a good looking movie, I liked the looks of the characters.  All in all I thought it was a decent movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie about 8 years ago and never stopped thinking about it for a long time afterward.   The movie begins with a small girl trying to steal a small car.  The young girl is in trouble for the car because her dad is the mechanic at the local shop.  There she meets a boy who has an old car, a Buick.  He says his name is Jack and they drive off together in the Buick and start a race.  After a while the boy pulls a car over and the boy says he was trying to find a ride.  But when he arrives at his dad's shop he sees it in a rundown condition.  When he asks the mechanic about the Bu the mechanic tells him about a girl who stole it from a guy named Jack.  So he takes the car back to his house.  This girl, it seems, was the daughter of the mechanic who had the old Buick but Jack had stolen it from him some years ago.  Then a young woman appears and she looks exactly like the mechanic's daughter.  She doesn't give him a ride and is too scared to get into his car.   The mechanic calls her a thief and tells him to get his car back from her.  Once he gets the Bu he gets his keys and starts to drive but he stops at the girl's house.   Now we have a scene where the girl tries to convince Jack to let her ride.   She asks him why don't you let me drive your car and he replies that she is a thief so he doesn't let her in.  They drive back home and the mechanic notices that his car is in terrible condition.   He decides to take his car to the mechanic but the girl refuses.  Again the girl is frightened and he doesn`t let her join him to his car until he makes his mother come home.  Finally they reach the garage and the girl tells Jack that she has no money for the repairs.  Jack says that he will just take her for a ride but the mechanic says that she can only borrow a car for the day.  It turns out that a boy is waiting for a new car so she asks him for a loan.  To get the loan the girl agrees to the price he offers her.    When the mechanic gets back home he gives the girl back the car but not before he takes a look at the car and then he tells the mechanic.  That he would have given

I didn't have high hopes for the sequel, but I was pleased with the film nonetheless. It was a little scary at times, but it was not as scary as the last one. This one had a few great and interesting effects, with a cool Halloween vibe, and a really solid soundtrack.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first thought after reading all the reviews was, "Wow, I really hope we get to see this movie again." I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where a group of strangers got so into it so much that they actually start to have sex on a moving train.   The best part was that they all had a great time doing it.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from I LOVED IT!!!!! I loved this movie! I think it's amazing. It had great humor. It was different from all the other movies. This movie was so good I will definately try to see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to confess, I didn't quite see this movie with the same clarity and attention that I have seen all of Robert DeNiro's great films. The movie is a bit of a mixed bag. Some of the dialog is pretty good, but at the same time, the director tries to hide his bad acting and his acting is the worst of the movie. This movie has a bit to do with the Vietnam war and the Vietnam era, as well as the Cold war era. As a Vietnam veteran, this film is a very powerful portrait of a man who is suffering and living out the rest of his days without much hope and without any help from anyone. He doesn't believe that the government cares about him, the government does not care about him and he has to rely on himself to get by. I had trouble getting into this movie. The dialogue is kind of dry, the characters are kind of bland and, most of all, the direction is kind-of sloppy and off-putting. It is not easy to find a movie which can hold your attention for more than five minutes or so. But I found this film to be very gripping and a great way to pass the time on a dark day.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has been around for a while now, but it's just now being seen in the US. It was written by Stephen King, and based on one of his short stories. It's a very dark comedy and a very disturbing look at what could happen when a person has lost their mind and starts seeing things that they weren't meant to see. It should be a very uncomfortable and dark movie, but the way the characters carry themselves is pretty much perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little confused at first about what I was getting into with this movie. I am usually not a fan of horror movies and I have never heard of a horror story about a girl who goes after some ghosts. Well, this film definitely does not disappoint. It is a very unique and fun film. The story starts out as one of those cheesy horror films that people like to call "horror movies". The girls are going about their lives and doing some everyday things and eventually one of them is called up by a police officer. When she comes out she is looking through the window and sees a couple having sex. The girls start to fight over what happened to them and they end up fighting each other. Well all is not what it seems though. There are some pretty dark and creepy things happening in this movie and they make this film one of the most fun and unique I have seen. The special effects in this film are also fantastic.   I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes to watch a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A friend and I saw a movie in the theater and there was a great scene where they are chasing a guy around with the cops.   The scene was great, and I enjoyed it.  I liked the way the movie dealt with the police. I did like the ending where a little girl asks a woman a question, and the woman doesn't know the answer, so she comes back to the man and tells him the answer and she asks him if she will ever see her father again.  The ending was great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't really enjoy this movie for what it was. It was a very generic, lame, action film. It had tons of special effects, some good fight scenes, and I was happy with the way the director kept the story, while adding a few silly and cheesy moments.   Unfortunately, it wasn't a bad movie, but it was just a mediocre action movie with only a few entertaining scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife has a terrible stomach, so I usually get a treat from a good meal after a movie, but after I watched this movie I found myself wondering why I even bothered. We have a big house and a large yard, so there are a lot of animals to keep the kids occupied and happy. The cats were the only real danger to the kids, and even the cats had no problem chasing after a flying dog.   The worst part was the cat that just wanted to jump over a fence and into a friend's yard to get some good food. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this when it came out, and I loved it, but the film is much better than it appears, and it's an excellent example of a 'prestige' sci-fi film.   The film is well-paced, with a strong focus on character and plot, and plenty of great action sequences.  At first I thought the film was a bit too short, and there were a couple of scenes that I found a little out-of-place (though they were not un-needed).   But once the film got rolling I was hooked.  It had a lot of strong action scenes, a strong plot that was well-thought-out, and a fairly mature take on what we are used to in genre fiction.  My only nitpick was the sound and music; the soundtrack is very good, but a bit grating at times.  This is a great sci- fi film; I really can't believe I never saw this film before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember seeing the first trailer for this movie. The premise was intriguing. An older lady (who was in her 70's) and her son, who was 5, were visiting their uncle (also in his 70's). The uncle's house was in disrepair. So the lady and her child were invited by their cousin (who worked in the house) to move in. The cousin had moved into the house a month earlier. The uncle and his family were all close-knit and well-liked.   In the movie, it was very much a family movie.  There was a sense of comfort and family.  The scenes were very gentle and soothing, almost like you could hear the sound of a mother nursing her child and the sounds of a grandfather in the background.  Unfortunately, I never had the chance to go in and see the movie. I found that after my aunt had the baby in my aunt's car one day I went to the uncle's to ask him to show me around. He would not even look at me.  He gave me a look I could only describe as "I'm sorry I can't come over today".   At the end of the movie there were a lot of things you should never say. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not a big fan of Jumanji before this one. Jumanjis is, in my opinion, nothing more than a cheesy Disney movie that is nothing more then Disney meets an Indiana Jones movie. I mean, how can you make something from nothing but this? It is not even an interesting movie! This movie has some fun parts but it is also boring and not very funny at all. And there are some stupid plot lines and even some cringe worthy scenes. But it is a good looking movie with lots of crazy scenes and I found it to be pretty fun. It does have some bad stuff in it but at least it is not that bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have always wanted to see a true Western like this. For a while I had been told that it was not a good film at all, but I am glad I saw it. This film is based on a true story about the legendary Westerns of the Old West, about a man who was a blacksmith and a brave general who took on the outlaws in the West.   The acting was great. The dialogue and the plot were very original, and it was really great to see an Old West like that on film, it is really hard to see.  The music was great too, but not like the classic westerns.  I think this film is about as good as the Westerns get now and it really shows.  And you really have to see this movie in a big theater to appreciate it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I was waiting in the lobby for our seats at the film theater, the girl who showed us the film kept glancing over my shoulder every time a person passed.   A good looking girl who is definitely attractive.  - The movie is set in New York in the 1930s and deals with two characters who want to become a world class model for the rich and famous.  This is a pretty good movie that doesn't rely on the old "penny dreadful" cliches as much as the plot could have.  It is definitely not a good romantic comedy with a pretty woman and a young man who seems to be falling for her.  I'm not going to review the music, since it is a hit or miss affair.  The special effects (which I like) are well done, and I really liked the character of the actor in the lead role of a man with a sad past, and a pretty girl.  They did a good job of showing a lot of the people in the background.  Unfortunately, a lot more dialogue would have been nice.  There is a lot going on and not enough explanation, but at least there is a good time with lots of laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about a man (Steve Martin) and his beautiful wife (Kathleen Turner) who go to a new home after a divorce. There is a "homely" person living with the couple - a homeless alcoholic who has a history of being violent. He's also violent and unstable - so the "nice" people who work for the couple have to deal with him and his problem. Steve Martin is at the peak of his career in the 70's and this film represents his career so well. We see him in character as a good father, a good husband, and a good man. He is always a gentleman and always tries to help and guide his wife and son through their difficulties in the new life. The film does not shy away from the subject of sex, and the story is about love and lust and how they can affect a relationship in bad ways. There are some funny moments, a few tear-jerking scenes, and some very touching scenes.   ...the only downside is the horrible acting by everyone.  It's true!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You are a kid. You are born in a little city. You have a mom who works at a local grocery store. You love to run around on a little island, just to look at the beautiful scenery. You want to be on the beach. You just want to have fun and be with your friends. You see one girl who is about the same age as you. The next day, she comes back from the beach with a girl she met earlier. You like the other girl more than you like her. Your mom has another child, a little girl. You don't want that little girl to grow up to be like you, because you feel she is too pretty and you want to keep her as young as possible.     So, one day, you run away from home. You run to this little island and then you meet another girl. She is beautiful and smart. She thinks you are too young to know any other way to live. But she lets you stay with her.  They grow up together. They fall in love.  She is the only girl you have ever known.  Then, one morning she wakes you up and says, "I have something for you."  You think you should go out and get something to eat, but instead she asks you to sit down with her on the porch and talk.  When you get up to go to the kitchen, you see she has made a big pile of flowers. She says, you look so pretty when you wear flowers.  You love them.  But when you get to the store, you find that she has a dress to make and everything you bought has already been made.  Now you are hungry and you look at each other and say, we should eat now.  The girl is so beautiful, you can't help yourself.  (I will explain how she looks at her own reflection later.)  You walk home with her in your arms.  At the corner of the street, you come across a big old house. It is so old and decrepit, you think it belongs in a horror movie. But as you walk through the door, you are so glad you finally found a place you can call home.  And the next day you start to work at the grocery store, getting paid nothing. You work hard and earn as much as you can.  It is very sad, though. The other girl who works there is an orphan who is all alone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good film, and a very enjoyable one at that. The story is one that is very easy to follow, and the story itself is pretty much the same as the ones that have been released before it (the most notable of which being the movie "Halloween H20: 20 Years Later").  This movie gives an interesting look at what happens when a few kids find out they are the ones who have killed the monster that terrorized Halloween H20. The movie isn't bad at all, and I would not recommend anyone to go to this movie if they only had a few minutes to kill (although, there isn't anything really scary about the movie, it's just enjoyable to watch, it even has a good ending!).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen the movie quite a few times. It is a fun comedy about a couple who want to have a wedding in a remote place. The couple is a couple of bad parents who don't like each other, but they get along well enough. The groom's friend and his wife are planning to have the wedding at a secluded spot. The wife is a bit of a weirdo who wants a family for her own sake, so the couple is trying to change things so she can have a real family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! I did a video interview with the actor who played the character of the guy who gets in a fight with a girl and who gets killed. I am not even kidding. He looked like a hobo and was dressed like one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about the life of a man who travels to Japan to try and find his missing brother. His brother is a famous singer, known as the "Man From Another Planet". His music is so much different and unique. A real "mind bending" listen for sure. And, I really enjoyed this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't usually review movies. I usually just watch them and let them wash over me.   This film is about a girl named Lulu (a Japanese name) who is a high school student and has the opportunity to go to Japan.  It's a lot of fun seeing her in a Japanese school and being introduced to her Japanese friends.  After a while of playing around in her new school, Lulu is introduced to a group of boys who are not as she imagined them. They have been chosen to represent the Japanese.  The only one who is cool is Kiku.  She loves to sing.  So far, the boys have shown her some of the different things in Japan. She has learned that there are a lot more men than women and that men love beautiful women.  However, Lulus best friend (the only woman to appear) is Kato.  While Kato loves music and loves Japan, she can also be a bitch.  Kato does a lot for Lulu, but not always for the better.  Lulu's best friend is Nene (an English name).  She is just as hard to get along with as Kato, but her singing ability makes it hard to ignore her.  Nene makes her own music and gets Katsu to join in on the band.  As a musician herself, Katsu becomes one of her biggest fans.  What the boys don't realize is that Lulu has a secret.  Her mother is a famous opera singer.  When her mother and her father first met, she was kidnapped and forced to sing for them.  Now, she's back home and she has to return the favor.  Also, her father is a singer and she just discovered a secret song.  With the help of the boys, LULU will have her revenge.  To give you some idea of the music, the first song is like a Japanese version of a Western song. If you're a fan of "The Sound of Music", this might be something to get excited about.  That is my only real criticism.  This movie could have had a lot better music.  I guess that it has been done before, but I was not a fan, I had a tough time getting into it.  Unfortunately, I watched this for a short while and it was just a waste of my time.  At the time, I didn't know that I would be interested in
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like you, I have not seen this film since its release in 1979. I was only six or seven at the time. The film was directed by Robert Altman and it starred Jack Nicholson as a depressed man who is a writer. The director made a big point of not using traditional methods of directing and using a lot of improvisation, but still made a fine film. Nicholson was very good as a man who has nothing going on in life and in this film he becomes obsessed with the writings of an old woman named Alice (Janet Leigh). He is obsessed by her writings which he believes he can read the future. This obsession leads him to go to a mysterious hotel and there he finds a book by her which is called The Secret Diary of Alice. This book leads him on a journey that leads him all over America looking for a book he believes is there but he never finds it. At the end of the film, we see him in a hotel room looking up into the ceiling with a cigarette in his mouth and a very depressed look on his face.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good action movie that is action packed, and is also enjoyable.   The story is really simple.  It's basically the story of two men, a master thief and a bodyguard who get caught in the crossfire between a big gang of drug dealers.  These guys are on a very bad day when they run into a very nasty gang of hitmen called "The Crips".   I would call this movie to be in the same vein as the movie "Kickboxer" by John Sturges.  The fight scenes in this movie are some of the best fight scenes I've seen in a movie.  Even though there are many people hurt in the fight scenes, they are all taken care of with no damage to their bodies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        "This is a classic example of a time capsule," said filmmaker Joe Dante. "I feel like I'm going to be a little sick every time I see this."   In the early 1970s, when I was a child, I had an unusual family.   I had three brothers. One, named John, played football and basketball. The two others, David and Mike, were the most beautiful people I ever met.  They were in their early twenties, the middle of a tumultuous relationship with an exotic blonde named Lisa.  As the sun set one night on the banks of the Mississippi River, I heard my mother say, "I just got some bad news.  Mike is dating Lisa. They've been married for eight months and she's pregnant.  Lisa doesn't like to work because she can't afford a divorce.  She thinks John is jealous of the attention she is getting from John.  But Mike won't quit his job at a shoe store because he loves it.  What I don't understand is why John and Lisa are not together?  John is a nice guy and always comes to me for Christmas presents.  John has three daughters, ages 16, 16, and 15, and Mike has a beautiful young girl, a few years older than John and about Lisa's age.  I don' t believe that Mike is jealous. He just doesn't want to share John. So John must be jealous of Mike.  It's a tough situation for John. Lisa isn't giving him any attention.  She's too busy being Lisa and her mother.  The more I thought about it, the more I liked Lisa and I wished she would let John go.  When I think about it now, I'm glad she didn't let him.  Then one day John came home from work and said, "Dad, Mike is going away.  He's going to go to Hawaii."  I said,  "Mike's coming with you?"  "Yeah. He says he's going because he needs to learn more about women.  Because he's got so much to learn.  And he won't be able to meet you when he comes back.  So he has to stay for a while."   I had to go out and buy him a gift so he could go.   "It'll take a while to pick a gift for John," I said.   I got back from the

The story was not complicated, but not overly easy either. I love how the characters reacted to their problems.  The music was great!   This was one of the better movies I have ever seen, and the best one too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      "The Bigger Brother" (1956) is a great picture.   It's not the only good movie out there, but it's the only one I've seen that's good, in a realistic, non-supernatural sense.  The best part of the movie is when the two boys get stuck in a tunnel while looking for the little girls they think are the missing little girls.  It takes a while to find them, but once they do they discover the secret underground lair of the Big Brother.  What's amazing is how well this movie has been made, it's a big hit with the kids and parents alike.  This is an old-fashioned, fun movie and it's worth a look by anyone with a little bit of fun in their hearts. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good, but not great movie. It's got plenty of action and excitement and doesn't come off as a cheap, run-of-the-mill action movie. However, it really doesn't go anywhere, it just sorta runs, so if that's your thing, you can probably enjoy it, but if not, you'll probably still have a good time watching it.

Like a nice movie can make a man do anything he wants to do,   as it was said, "he could be anybody and do anything"   When I saw the film I thought that it would be "just another action movie",   But it was nothing like it was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't expect much out of the film, but I was pretty pleased with it. The film was made by a very well-known director and I was able to tell that from his filmography. The movie has a story that is very well told and the story is very interesting. I believe that the story was well done because I didn�t really feel anything was missing. It doesn't really have a beginning, middle, and end, so I was really glad I could sit through the whole movie and not miss a thing. I really don't know why there was an opening at the beginning of the movie. There wasn�t much to the movie so I didnít really want to get into it, but there was a good reason for it. It has a lot of great music, and there were a lot good words in the movie to help to fill my ears.   The film's ending was very well done, it reminded me of the ending of a good book that I really liked.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be a lot of fun. It's a comedy that is based on a real life situation involving a married couple that came to an understanding that they were living life as a double date. They got married, they went on a double Date. They became friends.   It's one of those movies where you feel like you should be laughing.  It has a good sense of humor.  The movie is based off of a real events and the characters in the movie are just as crazy as the people they're based off.  This movie is just like everyone else movies about married couples where the wife is crazy.  There's no way she could have gotten married and had kids and done what she did and it wasn't her fault.  She had to take over her husband's business in order to support her family.  You know those TV shows where they start off with a guy and his wife talking and laughing and have a good time and then she makes him leave?  That's exactly what happened in this movie.

The first time I saw   The Matrix it was an amazing movie.  It was so amazing and realistic. I've never seen such an amazing story.  What a good idea.  Now with that said this movie was a great movie.   The script was fantastic.  But it was the performances that made it awesome.  And what a great acting job they had. I mean the whole movie was great.  There were no cliche scenes.  They did a fantastic job with their characters.  My favourite part was the whole "You can't stop the Matrix" scene. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with a girl having a dream of a darkly red-eyed woman with a red hand and a red cloak chasing her down a long, dark alley. The girl runs after the woman in a futile effort to stop her. The woman then turns into a beautiful woman with red lips and a blue skin and looks down on the girl and she realizes the girl is about to die and has a dream in which the girl begs her to let her go. The two women then disappear into a dark tunnel, only to be confronted by a man with a long nose who stares at them. The man looks like an Irish vampire who is looking for love. The film does not delve too deeply into any of its subplots and the only reason I gave it four stars is the story was quite beautiful and very powerful and was the main reason I watched this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't think the movie was good, but I think it was fun and it did well for its budget. There were not a lot of people there for the movie and the crowd was nice but there was a lot going on. They all looked a little odd, and one had to look a bit funny to see them acting. The movie ended on a good note with a great dance number which I thought was a little too quick for a movie. The dancing looked like it was done by someone from the "Blues Brothers". There were a lot more action scenes in the movie than the first movie, but in this movie there were more action sequences than any other. The people looked different and there was not much dancing. It was fun with a nice ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a story about a father and son who find a lost coin and a key in the same town. The son is a thief and the father is a detective and they get involved in an elaborate game of hide and seek and a whole new life.   I think I loved it a lot but there were some minor mistakes: The father is too old. His wife dies, they can't live together. They go out on a trip where they run into a drunk and a woman who's husband is in prison. They decide to go back to their house to live out the rest of their days.  It's funny how much I'd rather listen to an old man talk about old things than to a teenager.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the third time I have seen "The Lost World".   I found the second one to be an excellent re-telling of "Robinson Crusoe".  In "Robins" Crusoe has lost his island home and has ended up in a strange world.  In this "The Planet of the Apes" the ape's have been at war for thousands of years.  They have managed to kill off the humans who have escaped their trap.  This war has left much destruction in its wake.  The apes have set up a town called Apopo.  It is a strange town where they live in a large ape town.  Each ape has a home and each ape has their own special task that is done for them.   The town is divided into a hierarchy by sex and then by age.  If a baby ape is born the top ranking ape becomes the mother of the baby.  Then he/she is raised by her.  For a baby apes name they are called, this would be the name of their home and they are never allowed to leave this home.  When a baby reaches adulthood they are returned to their original home. Then their name is given and their duties start.  At first the humans are very friendly to the apes.  Even the men like the women.  There are only two things that can kill an ape, that is a poison and a sword.  A sword is kept by the ape village and can be used to kill an enemy.  However a poison must be prepared, this poison is made by a scientist.  Once a day a new batch of this poison are prepared.  To get the poison to be ready the scientist needs some of the other apes to perform a task.    The ape village leaders and scientists are the only ones that have the poison.  But the human warriors do not like apes, especially the women and the men seem to be jealous of their woman.   When the humans first arrive in Apopoc it was chaos.   The apes started to fight and kill each other.  After awhile the human soldiers managed to put a stop to it.  While in this chaos the humans have tried to kill all of the apes but all have failed.  Only one human survived to tell the tale.  Eventually the humans were able to convince the apes that they had more to lose than to gain.  That they needed to live in peace.   There were
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I was really looking forward to this movie because it's an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Robert Heinlein. The book is a sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein (1932-1991). It has some elements of the book, the most important are the fact that the humans live on a planet called Argo (in a sea in a galaxy), they live in very large towers (like skyscrapers) called "Prisms" and the planet is called the Moon. The humans have a social order, they live on top of each other and they have a government. The planet is a jungle like planet. It's not too beautiful, but it has a nice atmosphere to it. The most interesting thing is the alien species, the Parr, they are the dominant species, they have blue skins, green eyes, they can walk, but they can't fly, and the most interesting and most dangerous thing is that they don't wear clothes and they don the skin of their parents when they die. They wear the skin as long as it is needed, until it is worn out. The Parr use machines to control and guide them, like the brain scan in the film, but in the movie they use the brains of their victims. The Argoians, the scientists, they believe that the brain scans will be able to save a human life but they have to be on the top of Argo for their scan. The problem with the scan is that all the Argoian brains are in contact with the Parrs (all the Parrn use the brain scanners), so if a brain scan is done on a human, it will not tell the person the Parron will be on top, only that the Parrons are coming, and they could harm them, so it is a good idea to run. The human race are the only ones who don't need a brain, so they have the smallest brains out of all the races, but the Parran are the most intelligent race (they have many super powers). The movie is set on Argo, the humans have built a society there. The main characters are: 1. The hero, played by John Hurt. He is a scientist, he is also the head of the Ar Go society and he is in charge of the brains scan, the best scientists have to go on top where there are a lot of Parron. His wife is an Argoan. 2.

This movie, with its themes about how hard it is to love, has a lot of good stuff in it. I think it is the best love story I have seen. I do not know why it got such a bad reputation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I watched this movie like a kid watching the original Star Wars. The first time I watched it I was blown away. But like any child, I forgot it was called Star Wars and it became a movie I always wanted to watch again. And once I saw it again I realized it wasn't quite Star Wars, but Star Trek. This movie does have a very interesting premise with some interesting aliens and a fantastic crew.   The crew was a very good blend of sci-fi and adventure with an interesting and interesting plot to back it up. I'm a big fan of the original Trek  and I can't say I was disappointed by Star Trek 2.  I can only hope the sequels are better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have always wanted to see "The Last Airbender" for many years. The fact that I finally got to see this movie was a gift for myself and a gift to all of those who love the original. While it is not exactly the same as the first movie, it is still a good animation. The story that takes place in a fantasy world is very interesting and the new characters and their roles are very well done. The animation itself is very good for a childrens movie. This is not a perfect movie, I think they could have made a little more effort in certain scenes or at least done some improvements. However, I must admit that the characters that are introduced in this movie are very realistic and have a great dynamic to them. This isn't a very good movie, but it isn't as bad as the original movie.

As I was watching the film, I found myself wondering who the people are behind these people that are doing such awful things to one another in this film. I'm not going to say that these people are heroes, but they do a pretty good job of putting on a good front. I can't really say how well the film works if I can not see the entire ending, but I can say that I will be watching it again in a few months to see if the ending holds up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie follows three young women (not exactly what one would expect from such a short film) that all come from poor families. They live with their mother (who lives nearby), their uncle (who is in prison) and a brother they meet while walking around the city. The story starts out like a typical slasher movie. The first victim is a young girl who is killed by an older guy with a hammer. The older guy then tries to sell her to the next person he meets who also gets murdered. When a detective discovers the murder he gets his hands on the hammer (he has it hidden on a belt) and kills a third guy. The killer is caught by the police, but he has something else planned for the victims. He also wants to make a deal with the next guy he meets. Written by Jeff Winger <jwinger@jpl.nasa.gov>

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The second feature film from the legendary director, Akira Kurosawa (1905-83). The story was set at the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The Japanese Emperor is now a mere prince of Japan. The new government is corrupt and the old customs are still very much in evidence. There is a small, wealthy farmer who lives in a small village. He is a simple man with a large family but he has a lot of friends and a love for animals. He lives in the past, but he can see the present in the beauty of the land, in the beautiful buildings and even in the faces of his family. This is a very well made and very funny movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was my first time watching a Japanese movie so I was not prepared to have a laugh at my expense in the end.   It took me a bit to get into it.  This is the second part of a story about a student who was born and raised in Japan, but he is now living in the United States.  The story line revolves around the struggles he has going on with a Japanese teacher in his class.  It really didn't make me laugh.  He was rather monotonous and one sided at the end so I don't really have much else to say about this movie.  For a more interesting film about a young guy living in a foreign land I would have liked to see a more serious portrayal of a typical Japanese person living in America.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've been in a cinema, or listened to a film on TV, or just seen an advertisement for a film, then chances are you've heard of the film director Brian De Palma. You've seen his films, from Scarface to Carrie and beyond, and if that's what you're looking for, then this is definitely for you! De Palama's films are often a bit dark and violent, but they're always filled with a lot of heart and character; and that's why I love them! The film starts with an excellent set up, and I really enjoy the way that De Palamania plays on our senses to keep us watching. I've been going to a cinema with my dad more or less all week and we both love movies; and while he didn't take in the entire movie on the first day of seeing it, it definitely left a lasting impression on him and I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. If you're a film geek, but haven't seen a De Palamo film before, then you should definitely give this one a go.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie that takes place in a fictional "future" in which "everyone" has their "day", it's not exactly the most original, and the film's direction is very generic. I'm glad that the film didn't take itself too seriously though, and that the ending actually made a statement about what it feels like to be alive in a post-apocalyptic world, albeit with a "witty" character that does nothing to bring the movie down.

It's about a family with an average father who is a cop, a mother that tries to make ends meet in a town with no school, and an 18-year-old brother that is the son of a powerful politician. The kid is always the leader and has the tendency to do the dirty work.  This movie definitely doesn't do anything different than other police dramas, which are really boring. It's all about the police.  But I didn't mind the cops and didn't want to care about the kid.

The other is a young girl, and she is just a child. They live with their elderly parents.

I was looking forward to seeing it at the cinema, since it was a very good movie. It was fun to see a movie about a man who tries to become the champion of a country and the woman who tries in the end to get him to quit it. They both seemed to have fun in each other's company. I didn't think there would be much romance, but it wasn't bad.   What is really funny is that when they first meet, he wants to go back to England because he didn't like it there. She is also a big fan of England and is also happy she is here in America. She really liked when the British people played sports.  This movie was just too bad to watch. I liked that it showed two sides to a friendship. This was a bad movie from beginning to end. It has all the features of a bad film: too much talk, no plot, too much sex, too many jokes about religion. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     If you like your films with a good story, a good soundtrack and a good acting.   The story is good, I like the setting, I wish I could have seen more.  The acting is very good, we have very good performances for each character. The story moves at a good pace and it is good to see the story get better with each movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never thought I'd say this about a movie so I'll say it anyway, this is a pretty good movie with a nice story and it's very much reminiscent of the 1980's classic "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". The setting is also pretty much a recreation of that movie with all of the same characters (even the ones that were in "The Graduate") and the same general feel and theme.     The story really starts off with a girl named Linda (Sally Field) who is a high-school senior who just wants to get her life together and then, one day, she meets John (Tim Robbins) and the two instantly hit it off. They share a connection, a sense of humour and they enjoy each other's company and make the best of a bad situation. Then, one night, something horrible happens and John and Linda end up being forced to do something they don't want to do, but it can't be helped and it will affect everyone around them.  In essence, this movie is the classic 'Husbands and Wives' story. A wife who loses her husband and the husband who finds another woman attractive and ends up spending a whole lot of time with her.  When it comes to the actual plot, it's pretty much the same as that one, only Linda's parents are different and her boyfriend is a complete idiot. There is a bit of mystery too, but the movie's plot is rather short and simple, not really giving the characters much to work with. What the movie does have is some really good acting (particularly by Tim Robbins) as well as a good story. The best part of the movie is when they first meet and it really works to highlight the fact that this relationship isn't really about the relationship but rather the two characters and what they would do to survive. The ending is also quite good and gives the movie a bit more of a finale and really makes the movie worth a watch.   This movie is a re-enactment of the "Husband and Wife" story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (This review contains spoilers for "The Last Word.") In the very beginning of this movie, the character "John" goes to a private party, and after leaving, finds a very peculiar man in the elevator. It was a man that he had never seen before. John doesn't know how to get out of the elevator (with no door that's closed), and he's wondering why a man like this would go to such a party in the first place.   After he has a conversation with the mysterious stranger, John finds that he's not so alone, and that someone else is there to greet him.  It is a nice ending to a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best of the new series and also one of my favorite horror films from a new director.   The movie is the sequel to The Cabin in the Woods which is great and should get a lot of attention.  This movie is like a great horror, where you are not sure who is going to show up for a certain time but you know it will be bad news.  If you liked The Cabin then this is another great movie.  The plot is very much like The Cabin but not nearly as good.  If you have seen The Cabin, then you will like this, but if you have not then you probably will not like it.  There is some very good horror moments here that should please you.  It is an interesting premise that I think is a good idea, but it just gets a bit old after a while.  One of my favorites here is when the girl finds the guy's dead body and finds the axe head.  I thought the killer could have been killed with that.  What I liked about this was the movie was about a guy who tries to kill his family and tries to do it by himself.  My favorite was the ending, as it had a very eerie ending.  But this is a fun horror movie with some nice effects and a great premise. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of the Alien franchise, I've heard about Alien: Resurrection so I was pretty excited to see it when it came out in the early 90s. It's one of those movies that is so much more than what you see. The creature design is really cool, the action sequences are excellent, the performances are great, and the effects are incredible. There are so many things that are wrong about this movie, however. The acting is really bad. They are bad in almost all of the scenes. Michael Biehn's Ripley is so stupid that she doesn't even have any chemistry with Ripley. And the other characters are so badly conceived. I didn't understand why they made a movie called "Alien: Resurrection" if they had the talent to put together a proper film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have no real complaints about this movie. This is an interesting, but predictable plot about a group of misfit and disaffected teenage boys and their parents. A lot of fun in an 80's action flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not the biggest fan of John Carpenter, but I must say I found the idea of the film a lot more than fun. I'm sure it will be appreciated by a few people, however I'm a big fan of horror. The film is actually based on a graphic novel, though I'm unable to read it and don't understand the movie too well at all. The movie is kind of like a weird old silent film, only with more violence and gore, and a lot less humor and love stories. But all the scenes are creepy and creepy, so the horror aspect is the perfect counterpoint to the love story. The actors all do a good job, though this is their first movie together. A decent movie in my opinion, but not the best I have ever seen.

'The Young and the Restless'       It was a great film that showed us what it was like to have a young boy who could fight with the best of them. I saw it the first week in the theaters.   I think this movie gave me a taste of what it could be like to be an athlete and I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie, and I found it to be a very satisfying movie, despite it's low rating.   After I finished watching this movie I felt like I just had a really good movie.  It was just well done, and not a bad movie at all.  And I also felt like it was really good to watch a movie that isn't really that scary.  I'm not saying that this is a scary movie, but I thought it was a good and entertaining movie. I'm glad I watched this.  The Plot:    When a woman and her son leave the farm to return to their life in the city, the woman meets a man and a girl who are looking for a place to live.  The man is a man who calls himself the man from the lake, and is the leader of a group of people who seek to live a life of freedom from everything.  He gives the woman a small boat, which is what she takes to the lake.  Once she and her daughter are on the lake she meets the man.  Eventually the two of them are joined by the girl who is a boy from the city who wants to live in the woods.  After being lost in the wilderness for a while, the boy comes back to the woman who gives him a place and a name, and a job as a guide for them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first scene:  A group of thugs are harassing a girl in a mall.   One of the thugs tries to pull her purse, but she resists. The gang then grabs her and they try to rape her.  Once she is in the hands of the group, they gang-rape her. This is so violent that I can't imagine anyone would watch this movie and not want to scream, cry, and laugh at it!   The film was made in 1996 and the plot is similar to this one, and I have a feeling this one will be more disturbing, and the more I watched it, the more violent it became.  As I said earlier, I have never watched this type of film before.  I knew that it would be so violent and disturbing, but the more times I watched, the longer I was shocked! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My parents bought me this on VHS back in the early 90's, and I have always been a sucker for horror movies. I would watch it at night, with a few friends, and the fear was never too strong, nor was it ever too boring. I was terrified of the clowns (especially the big one), but never felt like I was in real danger. I found it pretty hard to watch, but still enjoyed the experience, so a little bit better than The Blair Witch Project.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie so much!   When I first heard about it I thought "oh, well that's a chick flick, you know, a chick movie about chicks.   It's about a girl named Emma (Emma Watson) who comes to live with her brother (Josh Hutcherson) and his family in a small farm in a serene and idyllic rural setting. Emma has always wanted to go to college but had her heart set on going to a big city college in her hometown, a city which she doesn't really understand.      In an effort to prove to her that she has a future in an industry that she hates (she has a thing for fashion), Emma agrees to be the model for a special clothing catalogue that the family runs.  Josh Hutson is such a nice guy.  I mean he is a little nerdy and slightly annoying but I liked him so much.  When she got the catalogue she found out that she was a model for the catalogue but she would also be performing as a model in the film, which was something she was completely unaware of.  This lead to her discovering a new kind of job which was that of a professional model.  But, because she was so busy, Emma would often have to go outside of the house to get dressed to do a scene that she would need to be ready for.  And so there would be a sequence in which she would show up dressed as a waitress and just get a few orders.  She would do a series of still shots of her being ready to go.  That's about it.  After all, her acting was mostly in the background in the movie because of how busy she had to be.  Now, if you have a lot of time to kill, I highly recommend this movie.  It was actually quite funny.  Even Emma's father (Ben Foster) was so funny in this movie because he seemed to always say things like "get dressed!  I've got some hot coffee to make!".  So that was great because Emma always was the one who was supposed to be funny and it was always her that was the funny one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   It was a movie I thought that I would love and it ended up being one of those movies that I just couldn't get enough of.  A film that should be seen by all, even if you do not want to spend your time watching it, but will help you with a lot of topics you need to think about.  This movie is very intelligent, it was funny and it was quite depressing at times.  It just hit the bullseye on a lot and if you are willing to put in the effort and read between the lines it should be an easy watch.  I like to watch films like this, and I really hope it comes out in a DVD format one day.  "It was just like old times."   One of my favourite films of all time.  And so, I thought I should write my review of this amazing film.  If you like the same kind of films I do, you should also like this one.

"I was in a car crash and the car was a big rig, I was thrown out and the big rig fell on top of me and I had a hole in my head, that was it. I was lucky.

When I was a kid I was in this accident that left me in a coma for a month, that's what happened, that is how the story is told."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie! I liked it. It has a good balance of suspense and action and that's what counts. It also had an ending that felt a little bit anticlimactic and didn't have an obvious happy ending, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It was a bit antic for me too. It's about a little girl that is very afraid of her own shadow so she hides it from other people and from her little brother. She has a very strange uncle who doesn't even seem to like her. The sister of her best friend says that her brother is always talking about a very special creature that lives underground, and when they go to see it they find out that its name is "Jagd". It has two eyes and a tail. It turns out to be a very beautiful, intelligent and very sexy creature. It is so pretty that she can charm anyone she wants with her beauty. And she also gets into the way of making love to it, but the little girl just has a big crush on it. She knows that she's a special creature too and wants to be like her and show off her body. She doesn't want to be the only one who knows about this creature but she knows she has to be so that she won't be alone. She just keeps on trying to make love to the thing, trying to have fun with it and being the only girl who has the opportunity to see its shadow. And it makes love to her too. And the thing is that when it finally does let go of the little boy and leaves the little sister alone, it makes a sort of a wish to the girl that she would show off to her friends how good it was. That she would feel happy when they were by it and it would show her some of its magic. But the girl does everything she can not to get to the shadow. When it finally leaves, the girl thinks that it has done its job and wants it to leave. She wants it out and is willing to do anything to get it out. She says that she knows what she is but she can't show herself to the people. But then she is told by the uncle that she needs to see the shadow for him to see what she really is, and she thinks of a way to get into the shadows. It doesn't take much for the little brother to help her. He knows how to get out of the shadows and gets into her pants, then he has her

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is fantastic.   It tells the story of a girl who is an angel trapped in a world of demons.  When she and her father discover the source of the curse, they must do whatever it takes to free the angel...and, for once, they aren't alone.  But the story doesn't end with the release of the demon and the angel.  The girl, now the guardian of the Earth, must find a way to bring light to a world that is dying of darkness.  It's a story of sacrifice and courage.  For anyone who thinks this movie is just a pretty fairy tale, it isn't.  As you can tell, the actors and actresses in this film are incredibly talented.  They do a good job of portraying a world filled with demons and a demonized world.  To me, this movie does a great job at depicting an evil world and how one of those demons is able to influence the lives of those within it.  I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has a good plot and a good story line. It had the main character in a mental hospital for an extended period of time.

The soundtrack for the movie is also good.   This movie is great for people who love science fiction or action movies, with some science fiction elements thrown in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In "The Day After Tomorrow" (1995), we see a lot of things. We see a war between good and evil in a small country. We also see a time when, as a young boy, a teacher tries to teach an anti-war story to a boy that is supposed to be his friend and confidant. He gives him a paper, and gives him some answers. The answers were about a young girl, who is a little shy and is not supposed to talk. So he tells her stories about what she should be able to do, when it comes to her "friends". The boy is a realist, but he doesn't believe everything he's told. So the girl, when she sees what he is trying to teach her, turns him around. She decides that he was wrong, and that she'll tell his friend about his "friends" to change his mind. So she does. The boy tries to talk his way out of trouble, but then the teacher sees his girl friend. She takes him aside and tells him what he did wrong. Then she shows him the real reasons for her decision, and he sees she is not all bad. He tells her how her parents, his parents, are really good people, but their society is not. He asks her if she knows why she is different than her parents. She tells him, and then the war starts. But, we are not there yet. She is already a little bit more mature than the boy. So, after all, they still love one another. We are still in the middle of the war, so there is a lot going on. We have a very sad scene between her and the boy that ends with him killing his teacher. It ends with one of the students, the boy's friend, asking him why he did what he had done. He answers, and tells the boy not to forget his old life, but to change it, to learn a new way of thinking. Then he tells the little girl his story of the world around him, in all its glory and its pain, how it was to live and how it is now. The teacher tells him to go and get his friend. But when he goes, the teacher is gone too, and we see her on the battlefield with other soldiers. She wants to take his hand, and they look at each other. It's hard to make a good film out of a time where young people were growing up too fast,

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pretty much a good-bad-good movie (the good part is not bad at all).  It's basically about a bad boy/girlfriend who gets kidnapped by some monsters and has to go find a boy who loves her and doesn't want her to get kidnapped again.  The girl's love interest (who happens to be a cute guy) can't find her or her sister and they try to do something about it by setting a trap for the monsters.   The movie is a lot like a movie about a girl who was kidnapped by monsters and had to go looking for her brother who has gone on a quest to save people.  Unfortunately, the two don't seem to be very compatible.  As for the good parts, the bad boy is cute and funny.  He wants to see the monsters because he has been looking for them all his life and doesn' t want his life to end like this.  Even though the movie is short, it is really funny. The girl is nice and not evil.  And the girl is not a monster, she's just a girl with a little monster inside of her.  That little monster is also cute.  This was a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       "The Lost City" is a pretty decent movie. It has a lot of good actors (most of whom you'll recognize from movies like "Election" and "Vietnam"), and it's good acting and production values. You can tell that director John Frankenheimer and his production team really wanted to make a really memorable film. However, the result is a little lacking when it comes to execution. For example, there's a really great scene in the film where a woman is being chased by a gang of thugs while walking down a street. And then there's the final confrontation that takes place with a sniper. However there are other scenes in this film that I feel are really bad and don't really add anything to the film. I also felt that this film didn't really have enough action sequences, especially since most of the scenes took place in the jungle. I do have to give credit to the director, however. While he obviously had a lot in mind, it wasn't very well realized. I'm hoping that his next film, "The War of the Worlds", will be more successful in execution.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite horror movies is the remake of the original, which I found in a bargain bin over at the local Goodwill (my mom bought it for me and I love it), so when I found it on DVD at a Goodwill I couldn't wait to see it again. It is a good sequel to the original and even better, because in the original you are left to figure out what happened after the main characters are captured (you are left wondering what kind of person would do such a thing). However, what you are forced to figure is different here. As the movie progresses we meet a young man (played by the great John Saxon) who is still haunted by his past experiences. This young man is a bit of a loser who goes to a bar in the middle of nowhere with a group of friends and makes a fool of himself every chance he gets (by being drunk, throwing up on the sidewalk, etc.). This group of "friends" includes a little girl (played with great confidence by Della Reese) and a bunch of other misfits (played, you guessed it, with great mischievousness).   The whole movie is a classic slasher story but one thing that I noticed that I liked was how the characters had a little more depth. I don't think we really know all of the characters (if we did the movie would have lasted a while longer) but we get a good enough idea of who these people are. Also the movie looks pretty good and the sound effects are wonderful.   I loved this movie, and I will definitely be going to see the original at least once a year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it a lot   The first act is the best part of the movie.   In the second act there is a really cool fight scene, it made me really excited to see what the next movie will bring, i like the idea of a vampire that lives in the sewers, it is a pretty cool idea, this movie is really fast paced, i really love the idea that there is not only a vampire, but a group of vampires that are living together in a sewer, there is also a few humans (human vs vampire) who live in the same sewer, i have to say i really liked the idea and story, i liked the characters, i will give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars   I like the fight scene in the second, that was pretty cool  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Buster Keaton: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Life" is a hilarious and heartwarming look at one of America's greatest comedic talents, Buster Keaton, and how his life and career affected the world. From early childhood to early adulthood, Keaton became one of the greatest comedic actors of his time. This movie is a great film to watch with your young child. The kids laugh as hard as the adults do and Buster Keatons story is well told and not as long as he would have liked. In the end, he seems to be a happy man in his twilight years.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is really really amazing! A story about a world that is not too happy with humans and a group of people who try to change this!   I really loved the characters (especially the little girls )   They all had a different type of personality but were really nice to the other characters!  Very cute!  There is really a lot of cute in this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like movies like the one in this movie a lot, a lot. I like how the movie is set in a small town. I also like how it starts out with a girl (I don't really know who she is) who wants to be a detective and then decides to stay in town and become a detective. It's also nice how the guy (the main character) can never be a real detective because he never gets the girl. He ends up finding out the real way that real detectives work. It also has a guy with a machine gun (the villain of the movie) and other bad guys. I think this movie is very good because it has a lot of good action, lots of people getting killed, a bit of good horror, and lots of good things that happen. It will also have a lot more nudity and things like that than the other stuff I've seen (the other things I've never seen).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a little bit out of the ordinary but it is worth seeing for the story and the special effects.    (I also like this movie, but I really hope that in the future the producers of this movie can come up with something new and original).   - The title of the movie, "The Invisible Man", seems to be a little far-fetched and impossible but this is true.  - In the beginning of the film, when Dr. Strangelove (Borat) comes into the room, it is like he is an old friend.  This feeling was shared by many other people.  From this movie it is clear that everyone is trying to make friends with the invisible man.  They do not want to look at him or interact with him.  Dr. Stirling is trying not to do this. When they all come together, they do not have any problem making friends with him (not all of them actually).  He is not allowed to walk around alone. He is kept in a big, locked room with a computer and a monitor.  In the film he is referred to as a'slimy, fat, ugly, ugly man'.  The film also shows him getting old.  He can see the ghosts from all around the world when he is alone in his room.  So how does the story play out?   First, the movie is told from a girl's perspective.  She is on her way home from her college when she is confronted with an accident.  It is an accident where a car went through a bridge and was hit by a train.  After she gets back, she goes out and runs into someone.  That person turns out to be an invisible man (also called 'Gremlin' because of his 'clumsy' behavior).  At first she is reluctant to interact with this mysterious person.  Then, after he reveals some facts about the accident, it gets interesting.  His actions, as Dr. Grinling Gibbon, are really creepy. He asks the girl to tell him some things about her parents, and if he does not want her to tell the story.  As he does this, he tries to get her to talk to him about it.  To say the least, this is very strange behavior to expect from a man who is trying hard to be mysterious.  But we also get a glimpse of his past.  If he knew where
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie in a 7-13 theater because I thought the film was so good I just couldn't wait to see it again. After seeing it the second time I don't know why I didn't wait a day more and go back to the theater to see the rest of the movie.     A couple of things bothered me about this movie: 1. It has a female character that you can't take seriously because of her behavior in the beginning of the film.  This was a mistake on the part of the filmmakers because the female character acted like a clown.  What is the difference between a person like this and a person that you would find on a road trip?  2. Another mistake was how much they used music.  A lot of the song in this film were really bad. The actors didn't even know what they were singing or saying so it was annoying.  3. The ending.  You know the ending the movie ends with. It was horrible.  The ending of this film was like a bad film that somebody just threw together because they were bored.  It doesn't make sense to me either.  There is no explanation for why the ending happened.  But the ending isn't the worst thing in the film because there is still the fun to be had with the characters.  I really liked this movie because it was entertaining and a little bit different from other Hollywood films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this about 2 years ago and I'm very glad I watched it. The film is all about the beautiful scenery. When I look out my window now, the beauty of the landscape reminds me of the scenery that I saw when I was little. It's a beautiful film about an old man who had a lovely house. The house had a swimming pool and a garden. It was always sunny and there was a lake nearby. The old man wanted to keep the house but he needed money to fix the house. He decided to do this by doing a little bit of plumbing every day. I would have loved to see this movie as a child. It would have been a very interesting experience. The story was interesting. The plot was well written. The acting was great. The music was good. I think this was a very good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story, the characters and the music, are very charming. The animation is well done, but a little bland. I did not care for the movie itself, so I can't speak about it as an entertaining movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A few things need to be said about the film. For the longest time I wasn't sure what to think about this movie, because the trailers looked pretty boring, and the movie looked like a low budget porno. I think I actually found out about it because I was watching a movie on my iphone and the title "Jealousy" came on the screen. Then when I turned the volume up on the TV, I found out that it was this movie. It is actually a pretty good movie with good dialogue and a pretty decent story. The girl who is the titular girlfriend is the best in the world, and you will love her no matter how long it takes. It's funny when her dad has a new girlfriend, so he gets jealous when he sees her taking his daughter's place. There is also a scene in which she's a stripper at a strip club, and it's pretty funny. And for the first half of the movie she doesn't look like she has much experience with sex. However, after a while she starts taking more responsibility, and then becomes more and more sexy.   The story is interesting, but the characters seem like they were written with a dry sense of humor. When there are actually sex scenes they are pretty obvious and not very good. That is probably the director's intention with the sex scenes, and I think it works, but it's hard to take it seriously. I'm glad it was more like a parody of pornography than pornography.  Overall I thought this was a fun, though not very sophisticated, movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not much of a horror movie buff, but I will always have a soft spot for the classic Bride of Frankenstein.   The Bride of Frankenstien is a solid remake of the film in the same manner, except this time the monster isn't a Frankenstein creation.  The film centers around a group of students who are on a field trip to see a monster-inspired performance. The group, who are of different faiths and different social strata, come into the tour's first show at the infamous Circus of Horrors, and after the show a group is being attacked by a gigantic tentacle monster. This leads the group to an old church where a statue of a large phallus, that looks to be a man, is being used to lure unsuspecting tourists. The monster seems to have a penchant for young women.  To make matters worse, the creature starts to turn into a real person, and the group must go to extreme measures to save themselves and their friends.  I haven't seen this film in years, and I find the remake to be much better than the original. I'm going to be honest and say the remake doesn't really live up to the classic movie. It isn't necessarily bad, but it is a bit boring. The story is fairly straight forward, but the effects work isn't anything special. The costume design is decent, the monster, and most of all, the story are just not all that great.  If you are a fan of the classic horror movie, this will probably be something you watch, but if you are not a fan, I would recommend avoiding this movie completely. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie! There are so many things I liked about this movie. The first thing I liked was how much the film was like the old "Superman" TV show and how Superman could fly! It's like a "Super" movie but in 3D! The acting was great, they just had to give Superman to a boy and the boy was pretty cool too! It was a great movie to watch. It was pretty scary, there was lots of stuff to look at and Superman is so fast and strong, the movie was awesome! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am currently working through the backlog of horror movies, and I thought I'd mention this one here.   As a writer who is always looking for a little bit more, and a bit less, in a horror movie, this one just seemed a little little too tame for me.  It was about a man who is trying to go home, but finds he cannot, and so goes on the road, trying to find a place where his mother can take him home.  But soon he finds a place that doesn't exist, and he has to escape.  I really liked this one, though.  I really liked it a lot:  My wife was a bit put off by it at first, but I really like the concept and found it really intriguing:  In the end, it wasn't a really good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be a good comedy.  This movie is one of those "dramas" that you see on TV, in movies, on the radio and even at the movies.   It stars the very funny and talented David Spade.  He is the lead actor in the movie, which has a good amount of laughs throughout.  The story takes place during a football game.  While the players are doing something, you can see the other players are getting ready to leave and the coach wants to go as well.  This is because the coach is out of the game for an indefinite amount of time.   This is not the same coach that the player knows or thinks he knows.  When the coach decides to leave the players decide to do a little prank on him.  David Spades is called in to do his best to change this.   He tries to talk a little more sense into this coach by showing him a better way to run a football team.  It doesn't take long for David Spaldings to figure out how to bring back the success and respect that he lost from the players.  Spades does his best and he gets the team to play their way, all the way through to victory.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A solid action/drama/mystery thriller that will leave you intrigued.    - Reviewed on 1/5/12 I will admit that I liked this movie a lot.  I'm not sure why I liked it so much.  It's basically an action movie in which a group of criminals attack a police station and the police in pursuit of the criminals.  But like a lot of action/thriller movies this doesn't really do much for me.  My only real complaint about the movie is that it feels like there is a big hole in the plot. I felt like the plot was really lacking and wasn't fully developed at all.  The villain in the movie really didn't seem like a threat at all but it doesn't change the fact that the plot of the movie felt really flat.  For the most part I did like the movie but I think it would have been better off if it was edited together in such a way that it was more engaging.  A really good movie, maybe not a masterpiece but a really good action/action/action movie and I can see why people who enjoyed this would like it even more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a story about a boy who is kidnapped by a witch and forced to live with her, and it's quite a dark story.     The film is dark, I can't deny it.  The boy and his brother go to live in the woods, which is full of monsters and monsters.  I am glad I watched this in the theater because the film looks quite beautiful in HD.  It's like a fairy tale and I love that about it. The cast are amazing too.  They all bring a different emotion to this film.  There is no love story between the boy and the witch, and there are a lot of curses that are used in this film, and a lot are used against the boy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is an original, well crafted, and very entertaining little comedy, that features the main character, who is a little girl who is trapped by her mom and the bad people around her in a world that is so strange that we don't even know why we are there. She gets a letter from her Uncle, who she believes to be dead, and she finds a way to bring him back. While it may seem a little silly at times to go see this film, it is really quite fun.    Tom Hanks stars in this new animated feature. The film tells the story of a little boy, who lives in a large apartment complex. He is the youngest of the tenants at his building, and he can be mean to all the other tenants, because of his age. When he notices a fire escape out of the window, he wants to climb up to the ledge and try to escape. But the fire escape is not meant for children, and the stairs don't work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good, but it has a long way to go. It's good for a quick laugh, but the comedy is too basic for me to be comfortable with it.   There is nothing original about the movie; not even in the way of acting.  In one scene, the man from hell is just a bully and a jerk.  The movie has many good scenes, but they are too brief.  I'm glad I saw the movie for fun.  For an adult, it's not very much fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What you might not know is that the film is not very good. Not all that good. The story seems to be a retelling of the events of a real life story of some poor man who came across a large black rat while cleaning a garage in an abandoned house near a big industrial park. He was cleaning the garage when he noticed a rat, got rid of it in a reasonable manner, and then thought to himself "You know this is a big rat, I should be able to handle this thing. It is not a big problem." So he went about his business. When he came back home about 3 weeks later, he began noticing something strange about the place. The house smelled very badly. It was the worst smell he had ever smelled. He began feeling ill. He called the police and they sent a man to investigate. When they came, they found the house completely trashed. The kitchen table had been pushed through the wall to the ceiling. The living room, bathroom, and attic had been trashed and ransacked. The garage itself was empty. The guy who lived in the house was gone. The police had no idea how this man had gotten all the way out of the house or why he had left in the first place. All the lights were out, and the electricity was cut off. The entire house was covered with garbage and mold. There were rat tracks everywhere and the smell was horrible. The man who was living in the home had never been in the neighborhood. The woman who was renting the house had been dead for a while, so there were no other people living in that house.   The film seems to have been made up almost entirely by a real estate agent named Joe. This is the third film of a series of films he's made about the house. It seems that the house is a kind of haven for some people and that when they go out of it, they feel worse than when they went in. There's a guy who has been living there and he gets a terrible disease from living in it. It's not clear whether the disease is the result of living in such a house or if it is something that comes from the house itself. The film is a very amateurish effort.  It does not look great. A lot of the camerawork is very amateur. There is a lot of "slide" cameraworks. In the later scenes the camera often pans across the house, and sometimes it even

As I've been listening to a lot of this stuff lately, the film was a bit too ridiculous to really make me laugh, especially because of the actor's constant use of the word 'bitch'.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second film in a "Lost in Paris" series. The first film was good, but this one is a little different from all the others. While I think the first film has a story that you can get into, this film has more to do with the characters than the plot. I liked the idea of a man who has a terrible wife. He was an ex-wife, so there's that. I also liked how he was a police officer. It makes it a bit more believable. The plot is a bit silly, although I guess that's to be expected from a children's film. And I can't really fault the acting, since they all did well.

It is a mystery that kept me turning the page. I never once lost hope, and I certainly never saw this film as a bad one.   When the film starts, it is as if an evil alien has landed on earth. It looks exactly like some sort of robot, and the crew looks like robots as well. In the beginning, we see a little boy named Alex playing with a doll (I think it was a doll) and in the movie, we are told that it is the boy's fault that the doll has to go back to space. It makes him want to kill the alien, but it gets caught up in a field of wheat. Then the alien escapes. The alien looks like a green humanoid, like a cross between a robot and a lizard.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first good movie of recent years.   I was hoping for a good action film from director Brian Azzarello.  It's not bad, but its definitely on the high end.  I hope this doesn't ruin his career, and maybe next time he takes a break.  Azzerello has done some really good scripts over the years and this one has an interesting twist.  Overall, not a bad movie but it's not much of a revelation.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent thriller with an absolutely fantastic ending.   The film itself was quite good.  I had a blast watching it.  There are quite a lot of surprises within this film.  The story is a bit similar to the movie "Lincoln" in that Lincoln and his wife are getting closer and closer to each other.  When a strange man appears on Lincoln's doorstep, the story changes dramatically and begins with the murder of a man in the streets of the city.  From there on, the movie jumps to the scene of Lincoln with his wife being dragged off the highway.  As the film continues, the mystery grows in scope and the tension builds up quite a bit.  "The Road" is a good, solid thriller with a great ending.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of all the movies about Vietnam and I was happy to finally have the opportunity to watch this. It's about the events surrounding a peace meeting and a visit by the president of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson. It starts with some rather bizarre comments made by Johnson about the war and then follows a group of Americans as they try to find a solution. There are some brilliant performances from Peter Sellers, James Stewart and Joan Collins and the pacing is just perfect.   When it comes to a war movie I guess it is the right time to make one because I'm not surprised at all by the amount of violence shown and it does get very graphic, but that's what war movies are for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am very happy that this movie is not just a simple romance.   One thing that I didn't like about it is that they used the same shot from a couple of different angles.  In one, it looks like the boy is being molested by the old woman, and then, in another angle, the old lady comes up behind him and holds a knife to his neck while the boy tries to run away.  The old woman then cuts the boy's clothes open.  I think this shot should be in the movie forever.  As I said before, this is not a typical romance movie but it is one that I would recommend to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie because it did the job of setting up a world that could be explored to the max for a good 90 minutes, but when it turned into a 3 hour affair, the movie slowed down quite a bit.   The reason for this is that we go from the opening scenes to an interrogation of a former child molester, but he's not even close to being the main character of this movie.  It's not like he's the only character who's under suspicion, but that's about it.  I would have liked to see more of this kind of character, because I was just expecting someone to come up with some new kind of kid molester.  This movie is pretty good, but I would like to see a bit more character development for some of the other characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoyed this movie, you will not like another one.   I don't even know where to start, this movie is just awful.  It's really hard to describe a movie like this.  Like a bad movie that you have to sit through.  The characters are just as bad.  For example:  Barry is a nice guy, but he really doesn't care about the other characters.  When the time is right he can't help but laugh.  That's pretty much all I can think about.  I know that in real life Barry and the other character don't have a ton of chemistry, but even so, this is just stupid.  A character like Barry that I can't stand.  After watching this movie I just don't think I want to see another one about a character like this ever again.  Rating: 0
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You see a movie about a boy and a girl, a boy who likes boys and a pretty little girl who is also a boy.   The movie is about the boy and the girl, the girl who's name is Chico and the boy who is named Chico-chan.  When Chico is born, the doctors told him that he has a heart condition. Chico has to go through some tests and the doctors put him on a ventilator and he will not be able to walk or talk. Choco is so unhappy about not being able to talk and not being allowed to walk and to see.  I was laughing so hard as I watched this movie, there was no bad guys.  The boy's name was Chico. The girl is called Chico (or Chico) and the movie is called "Chico-kun" (Chico's name) or "Choco Choco" (The Choco Chocho movie).  I loved this movie and it was just about two little guys and one pretty little sister, but I also loved the girl as well because her name was also Chico because Chico loves Choco.  This movie is really cute!   I will reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of Japanese Movies and the Japanese Animation.

Well I think that I have seen this movie a lot. I mean the movie is awesome. Well I guess my rating is 9 out of 10.

Although I never understood the Japanese (even my French is not good enough to understand what they are saying), it does not matter since the movie was good and funny. I am quite certain that I will watch the movie a lot of times.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot of this movie is actually a bit confusing. The story is about a man and woman who run a bakery named The Good Bakeshop. This place sells cookies and cakes to people who live in a poor village.  They are on the run from the law because they have stolen cookies and baked cakes from a rich family. The movie also has a great cast of characters. I have only seen the movie a couple of times but each time I have found a character that is very interesting. The scenes were well acted and the music was also very nice.    If you are looking for a good, funny, and very interesting movie that has a very unique plot then this is a good choice for you.

I also loved that this movie had a lot of humor and romance mixed in with it. I didn't realize how much of a bad guy that Dr. Loomis was until I watched the movie. I think that the movie did an amazing job in showing the characters as human and that was a great story to tell.   I really loved this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A big fat, fun, and crazy adventure movie for anyone who likes big, goofy movies.   The movie opens with an elderly man walking along the side of a busy, busy highway, stopping to read a newspaper. He picks up a newspaper from a streetlamp. He turns the newspaper over to find it's not a newspaper it's a novel. The old man says that it's time to make a new one because he's just about out of ideas for what he's going to write about.  He then picks up an old woman, who has just been thrown out of her house in a terrible storm, and he asks her to help him write a book about the time that he, as a very young man, helped rescue her from the storm. The movie then shows the two of them walking across town, stopping in a grocery store to read the paper. They go on to have a little romance, and then they continue on to a restaurant, where the old man asks the girl to marry him.  She says yes, but she has no idea what she is getting herself into.  When they get back to his house, it's raining outside.  The old woman gets ready to go into the house, but as soon as she opens the door, a lightning bolt hits the house and it falls over. The two of the girls sit in a chair outside the house trying to figure out what to do.  They decide to walk home through a very tall pine tree, but the storm comes and they have to get out of the storm to continue on with the plan.  One of the other characters walks out and goes down the path and comes back to the house in the rain. The girls come down after him. They find the front door hanging on a nail by a nail bit. They decide that they need to repair the door.  But the rain keeps coming and it continues to get harder and harder to repair, until the girls decide to run back to their house to see if the door is any good.  It is and they start to look around and notice a huge hole in the ground, and the old woman tells them that there is no way to fix the door because it is stuck with a huge nail.  However, the girls come up with a way to get the door to move and one of the young men pulls it free of the nail bit, and they walk on through to the door and open it and walk in.  Once
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "If you've ever seen a horror movie, but thought the killer was just a little too good for the genre, then this is the film for you."   I'm not going to go into the details here, as I think you can already tell that the story is pretty damn good. I won't be able to talk about it without giving away the ending, which I won, but I was completely blown away by this movie.   The story is told entirely from the perspective of a kid who's just moved to a small town. His dad is a cop who's trying to deal with an unexpected murder and is out to get his killer.  This film is extremely violent and gory, and while I'm a big fan of that type of movie, it wasn't really the type of film that I thought I'd enjoy, and it wasn"t until about halfway through that I was even remotely interested. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie that has everything: action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and action scenes. The first thing I noticed about this movie is that the movie is like a comic book, but with a twist (like a good comic book). The film also features a great performance by Samuel L. Jackson and a wonderful, if not perfect, performance by Jennifer Lopez. This is definitely one of the best action movies I have ever seen. The best part of this movie for me is its pacing, which is as fast or slower as you want it to be. The movie will give you a good time while you watch it and even have you laughing while watching it. The last half of the movie can get a little predictable, especially with its ending. But don't worry, it does have its moments, and if you watch the movie with a good pair of headphones, it will be as good a movie as it is.   I give this movie an A  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a good film, and it had a strong moral, but it just had too many cliches.   There were just so many good parts, such as the main character's father and the townspeople, the characters all were likeable.  And the action scenes were awesome.  In a perfect world, this is a great film, but I can't see it getting a great rating by other people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series. I was really looking forward to seeing this film because I have watched several other movies based on this series, and all of them have been pretty good. This movie isn't that bad. It's not as good as the other Harry Potter movies. But it's ok, it's not a horrible film. It does a decent job at setting up a plot. But the film is really bad at giving me an emotional reaction. In fact the film just does what it has to do.   The movie really just follows the usual Harry Potter setup: a group of friends have to go to a school trip to the school wizard's academy (that looks just like Hogwarts), and the group of kids will have to pretend to be students at the school. But instead of making a movie about that and trying to get the kids to really act like kids, the film decided to just make a movie for kids. The acting is mostly poor. They all try to give an accurate impression of the Hogwarts students, but they're all bad at it. And I would have to give the filmmakers a lot of credit for trying to create an accurate Hogwarts. The characters are mostly just there. There's a lot going on in the background, and some of it is confusing. They also all have their own accents. But these things are minor faults. The problem is that the movie doesn't really make a big effort to really show us the students at Hogwarts. And while some of the characters have a lot to do in the movie, most of the time they're either standing around (like a lot at the start) or talking. And then there's a few scenes that really do give us a really good feeling for the characters and the school (like Harry being confronted by Snape, or the final battle). I didn't really feel connected to any of the kids in the film, but that's probably because my friends at school were acting like kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story: In a fantasy world of witches and warlocks, a young princess comes of age. A prophecy of her birth, a curse and the coming of a warrior. The prince, who's been abandoned by his parents to take care of his younger sister, is eager to take his first steps in life and discovers the true meaning of the curse. The warrior, who is just a child, is destined to destroy the world of his parents and find his mother.   Story: The story is quite short, but it's so good that I had no issues with its length. There are some very good scenes that give a nice feeling of wonder.  I was impressed by the development of the character of the prince. There's a bit of romance in the story too, but a bit too much of it.  Overall: I recommend this one to fans of fantasy movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The story is simple: a group of young people take a bus back to their hometown from a camping trip. The trip is a rough one, though they make it back in time to see the local fireworks, it's in a small town that it's most fun. The group goes to visit a very strange old woman named Mrs. Blotch who seems to be a little odd but makes a good impression. While on a trip back to the house for dinner, the group is suddenly attacked by a killer bird. One of the young boys is killed and the other two are injured, but manage to get to the cabin and stay hidden for a while, the boys are eventually discovered by the police, which leads to some interesting discussion on the morality of hunting and the effects hunting has on a boy. All in all, a good story to watch with a group on a bus.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An American comedy drama that takes place on a small New York college campus. The film was made in 1976 and features the great Fred MacMurray, and his best friend Harry (Marlon Brando). Harry is an intelligent, yet awkward, loner. Harry's parents are wealthy, so they send him to a nice private college in New York. The classes are not very interesting and students do not seem to understand what is really going on. However, Harry becomes obsessed with a certain student, Linda. Linda's family seems to not be very well off. Linda has a lot of money and Harry becomes jealous and tries to pick on her. This becomes a problem when the Professor, Mr. Smeaton (George Raft), sees Harry talking to Linda behind his back and he is promptly expelled. Harry then decides to return to the dorm where he met Linda and her family. He becomes involved with the student, Susan. In the end, Linda has to decide who she will marry. The movie is based on a real incident that occurred in 1976.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I watched it together, and I thought it was a very good movie, with some good performances, which was a real joy to see, and, as I have mentioned before, I loved a lot of the people in it. However, the story could have been much better. We started with a rather slow buildup, in which the characters are not quite sure where they are and what they are doing, or what is happening. The plot gets going, but the main characters have not really made any major progress by the end of the first film, and the second seems to be about the same, if not worse. We learn quite a lot more about the two characters, and why they are in this position, and this is certainly important. However it is just a little slow, even by the low standards of low budget horror movies. It is not slow enough to really bother you. This is a great movie if you can sit through it. If you don't want to sit through some slow and tedious nonsense, it is not for you.   Posted by Matt at 9:16 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched "I Am Legend"   on a Wednesday night, and this was one of the first things that caught my attention.   When the lights went down and the soundtrack was played, I was absolutely mesmerized by the image that I saw.  The colors and the mood is so vivid, and the film was well-acted by some of the best actors I've seen.  When you look at the title, I am pretty sure you'll agree.  I had a feeling when I looked at the poster of the movie, that it was going to be a good film.  It wasn't long until the film reached its climax, and I was completely captivated by what I saw on screen.  As you'll be able to guess, this was not the first film I've ever watched that has made me think about the events of September 11th.  Even though I am aware of the events that occurred that day, and that most people have suffered greatly,  it has had a huge impact on me, and has been one of those films that has stayed with me, even after a year.  In spite of the fact that I am a science fiction/horror movie fanatic, I have to admit that I have not seen a film like "I am Legend" in a long time.  After seeing the film, I felt like I had seen it all, and after being so impressed by "I, Frankenstein", I found myself thinking about how the film got such a great reaction from me, especially since it was directed by the great Sam Raimi.  So, I thought I would give it a try.  Since I was so enthralled with "I Frankenstein", the only question I had was how they managed to capture the mood so well.  While the film is based on the popular novel of the same name, it is far from being a retelling of the novel.  Rather, it was a fresh take on the story, using a different protagonist.  There are no re-enactments of the famous moments from the novel, and even though the novel was adapted into a movie, it does not feel like it was written by a fan of the book.  Instead, it's a completely original take on it.  Also, I loved that they never tried to recreate the horror of the film. It didn't feel like any movie I'd ever seen that has scared me.  But then again,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did enjoy this film. The plot was not as good as in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" but was still good enough to entertain me, and there were a few nice moments. I was looking forward to seeing what happened to our heroes when the alien ship landed and they were taken aboard. I think it's great that there are two kinds of aliens, the good, the evil, the nice people, and then the bad, the baddest people. I am interested in seeing if anyone else will like it as much as I did.

But the acting, the storyline, the special effect, the way the movie is directed and the way it looks are all excellent. This movie is a must see, if you like the old school sci-fi films, such as "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and "Dr Who".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got into this movie on a whim one night, and I must say that it was a surprise that I enjoyed it at all. It was a movie about a guy who is trying to survive a war he has nothing to do with and can't understand why the world is so messed up. It's a story about a man trying to make it on his own in a world of trouble. It tells the story of a man on a mission to find his family and why he believes the people in the city are out to get him. It does a good job at portraying the war and the war is pretty well explained with very little in the way of dialogue. It also takes a few chances at the end with a great climax that was the reason I went to see it. It is just as much fun as it is tragic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot, but I can't help to think it could have been better. It was okay but not great. This movie was about a cop who has been with his wife for a long time and when he starts getting a lot of "free time" he gets hooked up with a pretty big (though not really a criminal) guy who has a whole bunch of hookers and sex with a lot more than just women. I was thinking about that last part of the movie and thinking about how a lot could have gone wrong with him and his wife if he didn't just not listen to his wife and get a job. That said, the movie was interesting and funny, and I'd love to see the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts off with a nice, dark and mysterious, opening scene that I love. I am a big fan of horror films, so I always appreciate a nice intro like that.   The story begins with the murder of an entire family. You can tell that there is something more to this murder, and the only thing that comes to mind is murder.  And this is not a movie that is going to be a gentle horror movie.  The film is brutal. The violence is intense and brutal. In fact, a scene in the film, which I think is an example of the brutality, was so intense that when I watched it, I had to get up and leave my couch.  This movie was not for the squeamish.  In fact I think the film is the most intense and violent I have ever seen.  It is not for a light hearted viewer.  There were times when I had an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach, and other times, when I wanted to put my hands over my eyes and keep watching.  But I guess I liked it because the film made me uncomfortable and uncomfortable was a good thing.  I liked how the main character, the detective, took on the responsibility of figuring out what went on in the house.  He takes on this responsibility without any hesitation, no excuses, no remorse. I also liked how he was a very strong man who didn't take no for an answer. And I loved his final actions. I liked that he was so tough that he had to kill one of his own for something that could have been so easily avoided.    If you are a fan of any kind of crime thriller, or horror, or just want to watch a very intense and bloody movie, you will definitely enjoy this film.  The story of the movie is pretty good, though I am not a huge fan of it. But I still think it was a solid film. The story is not really that original, and it did not really take me by surprise. But there is some good, dark, and twisted story telling here.  As the title suggests, a murder happens in a house. As the movie goes on, you see some things happening inside the house, and then it opens up to reveal that the entire house is filled with monsters.  They have an army of monsters that come out and attack the family, and they are only stopped because the detective and his assistant find out what the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a must watch for any true sci-fi fan.   The script is very good, the film is very well-crafted. The story is very unique, and I would never have thought it was possible.  The science fiction elements are very subtle, and they really work.  I really liked the way the film was presented.  My only real criticism, is that the ending was kind of a bummer.  As the film concludes, the world we have been living in is gone, but it's not without a sense of nostalgia.  It is very intriguing that a society would have developed such a unique system of measurement, but we didn't get to see it in action.  There is no time travel aspect to this film, but I'm sure that will come up at some point.

A lot of people would like to believe that a man who can't help his wife gets an easy ride and that's not necessarily the case.  This is not an easy movie to watch.

This movie really was a lot of fun and the acting was very good. The music was good too, I liked the ending and some of the other songs.    Hmmm, another one with a cute young girl, how old is she and how much do you think this one's going to get?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a huge fan of the movie from the time I first saw it. It was great to watch and I think it was very well made.   Now here comes the bad part, I don't know if it was the movie or the people who directed the movie.  They put a terrible cast together and made a crappy movie. The story line is the only good thing in the movie and that's about all it was good for.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those rare movies that is really a good story and a very good movie. The story is set in the past about a war in Africa called "The Great War". We are introduced to our main character as a boy who dreams of war when he meets this guy called General, a guy who loves a good fight and who has a cool look. He is a big guy, about 300 pounds and a man of many talents: he can dance, swim, and climb. At the start of the war he is with a bunch of boys from Africa, but later he is living in America, where the story starts, and he meets a girl from a different tribe, named Maria. And at the beginning of the movie we learn that these two kids are not friends but, as we know by the end of the story, that is exactly what they are.   When I saw this movie I was not expecting the story of a war. I thought it was going to be about some kind of a love story or some kind. I wasn't expecting a war movie, just a war story that starts with a love triangle and ends with a guy falling in love with a girl. But this movie is so good that I was able to forgive the story and the lack of good acting, for the character of the character that is so well drawn.  Posted by Richard G at 3:50 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a first film it had many aspects to it. Firstly the story was pretty interesting. It was not an action movie. It had some comedy. It also showed a couple of really strong characters. And the story and acting were pretty good.   A lot of action scenes were done without CGI, but that could be a good thing.  The story is pretty interesting and interesting characters are nice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think you're going to find anything more exciting than watching this movie.   The story itself, while somewhat predictable, has some great moments.  I do have one complaint, however:  It doesn't give a crap about the characters.  It isn't an overly long movie, but the plot is quite thin (in the end) and it doesn't really give a damn about any of the characters, even when the story does give it a shit about them.  If you like action movies with bad guys and good guys and you like a good plot to get you through it, then go watch this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a very exciting movie, a very sexy young girl comes to London, seeking to have a quick adventure. She does manage to be a little sexy and a little wild.   And yes, she is still very very naughty, even in bed. But we get to see quite a lot of the city, in London and outside, too. There is a good storyline here.  The only problem is that this was not filmed to look very good in the beginning. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed The Secret of Crickley Hall. It is a well written romp through a Victorian London. It is very interesting. It has a lot of surprises and there is even a very nice ending. It was not so much my cup of tea, but I'm sure if you like the kind of Victorian novels that I do, you might enjoy it. I'm a fan of the Victorian era and I was expecting some very strange things. I also really enjoyed the way it was written.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, I'm sitting down to watch a movie I saw a few days ago.   It's a pretty decent movie.  It doesn't seem to bother me very much.  And it's an awesome story about a girl that wants to be a witch but doesn't have the necessary ingredients.  There are some good action sequences in the movie, but it's mostly pretty generic stuff like being on a train, running away from someone that likes to kill people, and fighting off the local vampire that is after the girl.  The girl is cool though.  That's what I like about movies, they get better and better the more you see them.  But it's kind of boring, and I can't get behind a story about someone being cursed by an ancient witch (and how she can be freed) but not being able to actually be a good witch because her curse has turned her into a beast and she can't even get close to humans to do spells.  Now that's not the only problem though. The girl and her older sister are cursed to be friends and do absolutely nothing but talk about things they're both afraid of and feel bad about.  So they do that.  Well, it's fun, it doesn't bother me, but I can see the appeal.  I guess.  One thing I noticed about this movie is how similar it is to something by the same name by Rolfe Dahl. It was a film about a boy (the main character) who was a big vampire, and how his curse got out of control.  This movie seems to be more similar to the movie that it follows, with a girl who wants to become a witch, and who isn't able to do that because her sister has put an end to her curse.  While that's kind is what I see here, there's a lot to this movie, and it's really interesting.  Again, it all depends on whether you're interested in watching a movie with a witch who doesn't know how to do magic.  If you like the action sequences, you'll probably like this movie.

The film ends very quickly, and all that needs to be said is that this is a fun movie, to be laughed at, and to have a good time.

I really liked the movie, the characters were interesting, and the movie is entertaining, and not as boring as a "movie about a dog".
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was born in 1970 in the Philippines, and I can see now that this was a good, young movie. The Philippines is one of the most beautiful countries, yet the government was oppressive, and there was a lot of corruption and drug trafficking going on in the streets. There was a "special" school, called the "Philippine National School", that the children went to, and it was one of a lot better than most of the other schools. However, there was also a "private" school (which had the most corrupt teachers and the most incompetent and nasty school principals), and the children of the Philippine government spent their whole lives there. There were some interesting things in it, such as how the Philippine schools are funded by bribes and even by the people who steal from the poor.   In fact, the people of the Philippines were so proud and proud of their "education" that they would let their children be taken from their parents, and forced to become slaves in the mines of the country. They would force these children to stay in a very small room, and to eat what the people gave them. The children were so ashamed of their poverty that they could not even speak their own language, so that they were even ashamed of the teachers and principals.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film starts off with a quick shot of a woman taking a shower. The camera then shifts to a very close up of her and her shower head, a couple of the guys then show up.   This is about a young girl who has a crush on a handsome young man.  The girl finds a way to use the shower to her advantage.  She begins to get very wet and then suddenly she faints and her boyfriend appears. He gets her to a doctor, he believes it is caused by the shower.  After a few more scenes that are almost entirely set in a bedroom and two very close ups of a guy's privates, it is then revealed that the girl's boyfriend is actually a demon who wants to destroy the world and the people in it.  This scene, at least for me, is the only one of its type in the entire film.  A couple of guys come over, they do something to their privates and then their privations are shown.  They are so horny.  Then the girl turns around and asks the demon "How can you kill people with sex, like you want to do?" The demon, at this point, is so horny he decides to give her the blow job she has always dreamed about.  I thought that it was pretty cool the way that he was doing it, and was sure that this was going to end in a lot of sex for her.  It does not, it ends with the demon raping the girl in a very hot way, then she dies.  My favorite scene of the film was the one in which the demon is shown trying to find a human in his dream.  There was a great moment in that where a small woman comes across the demon's dream and she is almost in tears.  The demon appears to her and says "It's like I'm trying to kiss the dream girl, but it's just impossible".  Then he leaves and the little woman is left crying.  Even though the little girl is killed, there are several scenes where her dead body is shown.    This was a really fun film to watch, as it had lots of blood and gore and a great cast.  If you like your movies to have a bit of humor, this is for you.

He attacks people and eats their souls. The "Reject" was a favorite among the children of the family. This is one of the better animated movies and it does have a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The best and most honest movie about being gay in a small town that I've seen in a long time.   One of the best parts of the movie are the guys that come out of the closet, even the straight guy comes out of his closet to his girlfriend (who is a real drag queen) and then their friends to have a little fun before he is called into the Army to serve his country and his friends to be nice and make sure he is happy.  The movie isn't perfect, it could have had a better ending.  But you have to have love in your heart to love this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great blend of comedy, drama, and romance, and for the most part I enjoyed it a great deal. For one thing, I love the way the characters all live their lives without any real interest in each other. They all seem to live with a sense of urgency, but I think most of this has more to do with the fact that the characters are forced to share the same bedroom, and so I think we have some of the best actors I've ever seen doing the same thing, with the same results. They are all really funny in their own way and there are a great many jokes in the movie, and at times I thought it was going to be a very good romantic comedy. The story is just wonderful, and I really liked the way it was presented. It took some of my favorite scenes from many of my favorites of recent years, and incorporated them into a very charming tale. The performances are all very well done and the story is pretty much perfect, so what more could you ask for?   I'm not sure how much I can really tell you about the story. I'm sure it will have your heart racing, your eyebrows raised, and your lips pursed in anticipation, and maybe that's all it needs to get you to watch it. The characters are very well fleshed out and the relationships between them are very good. I would probably not be able to say how much of a romantic comedy this is without getting a little bit spoilery. If you like funny characters, and really good romantic comedies, this is definitely one you will want to check out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of my favorite movies.   The movie begins with the main character, Michael (Robert Duvall) a New York cop getting into a serious road accident. In an effort to save his life, he is sent to a remote island called San Clemente to care for his wife and daughter who are being held captive by a gang.  In an attempt to keep them safe, Michael and his partner Frank (Alan Arkin) go to the gang's hideout and attempt to track down the gang leader. They eventually find the leader and his gang and Michael sets up a poker game between the gang members to decide who will kill the leader first.  Once everyone has gathered at the poker game, Frank kills the leader while Michael holds him prisoner.  It is at this point that the movie begins to truly start to get interesting.  During a brief break in the action, the camera pans across the island to see a small group of children playing a game on a beach. The children are a nice touch and a nice example of why it's great to have a good soundtrack on a film like this.  A young boy named Jack (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a member of the gang and during the game, he accidentally kills a boy named Eddie (Joseph Gedrick).  Jack then gets the gang to kill Eddie and his cousin, but the gang is unable to kill them.  Jack finds a bag of money lying around and uses the money to buy a pistol. This is the beginning of the film's more interesting moments.  There is a scene at the beginning where the gang has a meeting to decide on who is going to kill the gang boss and the gang decides that Jack must do the killing. The scene is filmed well and it shows that the gang does not believe Jack and is scared of him. Jack eventually beats up the boss and is captured.  After Jack is captured, Eddie's sister, Maggie (Melissa Leo) is killed by a rival gang. When the cops arrive at the scene, they find the murder scene and Eddie is taken into custody.  Michael is then sent to the island for his own protection and to be nursed back to health.  He is allowed to live at the island until he can be repatriated to New York.  The gang leader, Harry (Robert Redford) is kept in a small cell in the main compound which has a small bathroom and a single bed. When he is able

I always thought of Toronto as one of the most eclectic cities in North America, and the movies I had seen there were always great. I was excited to hear that one of these great movies was to be shot in Toronto. I am glad that I went to a preview screening of the movie.   The movie is a good blend of fantasy and comedy. There are some serious scenes in this movie. The film is very funny at times. There was a scene where a young woman went to see a movie, got lost, had to go back, and finally found a bar that she could stay at until the movie was over. That was a good scene. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen the movie "The Devil's Candy" several times since I was a kid, but it is one of those movies that I cannot get enough of. It is a good, fun movie. My mother watched it when I was very young, and it was the first movie she showed me and I really enjoyed it. It reminds me of old Bugs Bunny cartoons. It has lots of heart, which is important when you are a kid. There are some cute little monsters and even a monkey. It does a great job of selling candy, but there is always something to make you smile. It isn't much of a mystery and I liked it. But I would only recommend it if you are going to a kid's birthday party or a special event.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went into this movie with a lot of expectations about how it would be. I have watched the movie before, and was hoping this movie would be better than the last one.    The story was a simple one, about a father/son who are in a car accident, their son dies, and their father is left devastated.  The movie was funny at times, and even though it was dark, I did feel for the characters.  I really liked the characters, even the bad ones.      This was a good, if not good, film that did not have anything that made me cry.  There were a few scenes that made you feel for those characters, but most of the movie was dark.  A decent film that you may enjoy.

The movie has some good moments that really make you wonder how could they possibly top this movie and I would highly recommend it.   " I will use all my abilities to destroy your spirit.

From the animation to the story to the characters to the great action scenes to the awesome special effects and soundtrack to even the costumes. There is nothing that I don't like about this movie. The whole cast is great. Even though the Avatar and Master Roku are really the heroes of this movie they are not the only characters that have great roles in this movie or the one's that will get the most action scenes. There are also some good supporting characters that I hope you enjoy even if you don't know much about the Avatar world.

The film is very much like the movie that it is inspired by, "The Godfather".   The movie was made in 1979 and has since been a big success in Hollywood. The movie is set in New York in 1981. It tells the story of a group of street urchins who get picked up by a mobster and taken to a mob based in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  There they are instructed to take over a casino and take it over themselves.  They soon learn that it's not a "real" casino and that there are many tricks and a whole bunch of other shenanigans that are going on.  This movie really has a good, gritty feel to it. I really liked this movie.

If you like comedies with a little kick, I recommend this one!   I will add the movie was in competition in a  lot of festivals and won 3 out of the 4 awards.  There are many things I like about this movie. The acting is very good.  Most of the guys are good. The one who makes me laugh is the boss.  The plot is really simple.  One guy is jealous of another guy.  He tries to get rid of him.  At the same time he's a bit crazy.  This was really funny and enjoyable.  I'm a fan of 80's comedy and this movie is just a very good movie to add to the collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I've seen since "Citizen Kane."   Director Francis Ford Coppola's version of "The Godfather" is a fantastic example of how to do an original story from the original novel and get it right.   I had never read the novel before seeing "The Man Who Wasn't There" and I loved every minute of it.  I saw it on TV when I was very young (before I went to film school) and the story stuck with me.  This was a wonderful movie and I can't wait to see the sequels, "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" and "The Last Temptation of Christ."

The plot is pretty simplistic:  They're building a nuclear reactor.  One day a freak accident happens and the nuclear reactor goes "vomit".   This causes a lot trouble, and the movie ends up dealing with all of that.  But you don't just watch the "bad" endings:  The "good" endings are good too!  There is a little "heroic" part at the end that I found quite funny.  I like the way they went about "getting out" of a bad situation.  There were a lot more explosions than in the trailer:  This movie could have been a lot worse.

One of the passengers tells him to leave the car because they don't like him. This is all we hear about the stranger. He tells them that he will lead them to a world of peace and plenty. But he does not explain what exactly he means. In one way this is a classic story about a man going on a journey. But it has a twist and a surprise which gives it an original and unique look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a remake of a film called "The Great Silence" that I saw when I was 5 years old.  It was made in the 1950s, so it is not a great movie by today's standards, but it is a classic.   There is very little plot in this movie that you don't already know.  The story is told from the point of view of two young women.  One of the girls is a mute mute.  When she is born she is brought up in a mental asylum.  This girl is so very different from the other children she sees around her.  Her parents love her more than the other girls do.  They are both great artists, but the parents want their daughter to study.  In the film she is the only artist and is allowed to paint.  She does this by drawing pictures on the wall with crayons.  All the other kids are not allowed to draw but they do. It's not the most beautiful drawing, but to these kids it is normal.  There isn't a lot of dialogue, but when it does come it is pretty funny.  I don't know if this is the first movie I have seen that includes music, but I found it enjoyable to listen to.  And one thing I was very happy to see in the movie.  A little girl that doesn't have a name gets to sing.  While we are at it, the mute mute is one of the best actors I have ever seen.  Finally, the movie is really funny. It was a little bit slow at the beginning and the movie ends on a pretty cliffhanger.  The Great Silent, 1950 The film was good, but there was not a lot to see.  So, for my 5 year old self, I thought I'd make a little movie. So I recorded it.  My daughter found it funny. She has heard it many times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this movie in the cinema after the screening for The Good Earth. I was in the theatre, in the same row, about 20-30 moths before the movie start. When the movie started, I was already expecting something like The Good earth, because of its beautiful landscapes. But this movie was different, a bit funny. It did not have much of a plot, and the humor of the whole movie could be very much similar to the movie The Good end Earth, because they were both about the same person, but with a different idea, a very different world. Anyway, it is a good comedy, and it is not as beautiful as The Goodearth, but the scenery is good, and I think the movie is worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am glad I went to this movie, and now I really want to watch a horror movie.   This movie was a bit scary at first, but not as much as I thought it would be.  I would like to see a remake with a good story line, but it is not very scary in my opinion.   5 out of 5 star rating I am in love with this movie! I love this horror movie! It has great characters.  It was funny at times, but I still love it.  The plot is really great.  As soon as you start the movie, you don't know what's going to happen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought about what would happen to my husband, when he was killed by an accident while driving. I was alone with my two little girls. Suddenly a car with three kids drove past. I had just gotten up from the toilet. The car was full of children and their parents were screaming in the back. I heard a car horn and saw a little girl. It's not every day you see a little child driving a car. It looked like she was flying, almost a kite. There were three little girls inside of the car. I don't know who was driving it. The man in the car was screaming, screaming his head off. All he wanted was to drive on to the next town. He was only 15 years old and his little girl was 8 years old. He couldn't drive because of some sort of injury. I never said a word to my girls, I just stood there by the door, not wanting to say a word. I didn't want my husband to be gone. The girls were crying, the little girl with dark hair, blue eyes. She was the prettiest of the three. She stood up and started waving her arms. The little girl who couldn't fly went over to her father, who was sitting in the front seat. The girl said something like "don't worry daddy, we're not going to get hurt." She went up to him and gave him a big hug and kissed him. Then she said, "Don't worry, it's not like we are gonna die." Then the little girls disappeared from the car and everyone laughed at the accident. When we got home the doctor said my husband was dead. The doctor said he was dead in an instant. His head was cut by a piece of the windshield. I went to the garage and picked up a shovel. I asked my husband's mom to go upstairs. My mom said "Mom, your husband is dead. Don't you worry about him. He's not going back to life." I went upstairs, I heard my husband in there. He said "my little girls are running up here like mad, but they don't have a clue what's going on." I asked him, "Where are you guys going? I want to hear it from you!" He said, in this little house there's a room on the left where my two girls sleep. Then he said, he said "There's a little window right next to my bedroom. I'll

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first go with the old classic and it was well worth the effort. The story had me in stitches and I enjoyed the action from start to finish.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think we all should know by now about the movie " The Green Mile "   The film is a fairly straight forward action movie   In the middle of the movie there are a couple of scenes involving a group of characters who are trying to escape the army of zombies   I haven't seen anything that has so perfectly captured the essence of a zombie apocalypse    My only problem is that there are two movies in the world with that exact title.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this about a year ago.   It's about a woman named Jessica (Jessica Alba) who has a love affair with a man named Ryan (Ryan Gosling) and they go on many adventures together.  The movie was shot in France so there are French cars in the movie, and the soundtrack is a nice mix of French and Italian songs.  When it comes to the story of the movie it's not exactly the most innovative.  For the story, there are some twists and turns along the way that make the movie a little different.  It may seem like it's been done before but if you really want to find a different take on a love story then give this a chance.  Jessica and Ryan are not the stereotypical romantic couple you see in a lot of movies, they have a lot more going on than meets the eye.  I think the ending of this movie is probably my favorite part in any movie I've seen.  This movie had a great ending and it makes you want to see more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it only has 4 episodes. Yes the movie is quite good, but when you have a movie with four episodes, you better make sure there is a good story in each episode.   However, this movie has a decent story line, and the characters are well done.    The movie does have some funny scenes in it, but I can't say the same for the story line.

And one day the brother, who has just been released from jail, decides that the only way to make money is to go around with his dogs. So he gets them all killed, eats the meat, and then takes his revenge by torturing his brother. And the only one who cares about him is a very kind little girl who keeps on giving him the medicine that will keep him alive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can't go wrong with this movie. I love the "dinosaur thingies" and even though a small film in a very small theater this movie has a lot of laughs.   The characters are very likeable even though they do have a few weird quirks and the story was never really interesting (as far as I could tell).   For me, this is a great movie, you can't ask for more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of the movie is very simple: The main characters of a family in need of money meet a woman who needs money, and she agrees to let them borrow some from her husband. However, as soon as they take the money, they realise that she is cheating on her husband, and it's all over before they've even got the money. The problem is that they are too old to even try and find a new partner, and while they live off the interest of the money they stole, they can't even afford to rent a flat. So they do what any family in that situation would do: They sell everything that they own and give the money to the new lady to help them out. This doesn't solve the problem, because they can afford a much bigger house but have no money for it, so they have to make a new friend. However their first friend is a woman named Charlotte, who is a lesbian, and despite her sexuality, she is a good friend. The couple are very lucky to have this lesbian friend, but this is a one-woman show for the rest of the story. The movie is really fun, and there are some funny scenes, such as Charlotte giving the guys a lecture about how men should dress and act and how women should treat women, which is something that happens every day, and the only reason it's funny is because there are three people in the film, and they all have the exact same opinions.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie will be more or less "memorable" and you may "remember" it. The only thing that I "remember most" is that it is very dark. The story is not too strong. It's a very poor story. There is nothing too good about it.   A big, huge movie. It is well made with well written dialogs and the story is a lot "interesting" and has a lot of mystery.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's a classic: It's really hard to make a good story without all the usual Hollywood Hollywoodisms (the hero is always a great shot, and the villains are always bad) and then you have to have a well-acted performance by every actor in the movie (plus there's a fantastic female lead to add to the action).   I've never seen the book, so I can't really say what makes the movie a classic. The film was released just after the release of the movie adaptation of the TV show and I thought it did a much better job at representing the story, and in a lot of ways the film is better at the book's source material than the film.   It's not the greatest film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a fun, fast-paced, action-packed movie that I'm glad I watched. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - It's a great and entertaining movie!   The acting was superb.   All the kids were excellent.  - They're talking about what happened to them when they were in middle school - and how they got into college - and now they have a job, a house, two kids, and a dog - well, let's just say they're living a life of "hope".   It's just a fun movie! I'll watch it again - it's a little on the short side but if they don't get better performances from everyone I'll go see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about a little boy, with a dreamy little voice, a father who loves him and is kind to him.   It starts out with him on his bike, riding through a forest on his way to see his father (I think we should see his dad!) There's a tree in the way of his bike.  It then goes on to the present day, and the father and son have a pleasant conversation about his dreams and what they mean to him and how he feels when he is awake.  Finally the father comes back, and shows the boy his dream home, a home filled with all kinds of trees and flowers and toys and, well, little cars!   They spend the rest of the movie together, in and out of bed and in and around the house.  If you're an adult who loves kids, and love seeing them laugh together and play together, this is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (no spoilers) "In the year 2036, after a long war and a massive earthquake, a large city known as "The City" has been constructed on the land of the former state of the nation of The Federation. In this city there exists the highest living standards. People live in the best possible ways and there is a great deal of optimism. However, in the center of the city is a tower known as the Tower of Babel, which contains the knowledge of all languages on earth. In a world of international competition between nations, it is clear that the Tower is the only solution to all problems. When two young women, Lucy and Lisa, become separated from the rest of the group at an airport, they try to locate each other. But when they get there, the two don't seem to be related to each other at all and there isn't even a trace of an accent in their voices. So they keep walking around until they get to a place called "Dawn," where they are greeted by two men, George and Simon, who immediately fall in love with them. The following morning, they are attacked by several monsters who are trying to destroy the tower. One of the monsters was a giant who used an advanced type of weapon that has never been used before, so the battle goes on for a while until a man from the outside, named Peter, appears, who helps them destroy the monster. But then, one of the soldiers that was hiding among them falls in the fight, and he dies. He is quickly surrounded by a group of soldiers who come to take revenge. This event leaves Lucy and her friends stunned and terrified."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about a young boy that is going to be sent to a school for young people in a foreign country called a "land of freedom". However, the boy finds himself in a world that is very strange and evil. There is no peace and no love in the land of freedom. It is full of hatred and evil, and there is no hope for the boy who will have to survive this horrible world.   This film is a masterpiece. It will give you a better understanding of what the world is like, what is life like and what should one be thinking about. It also gives you a good look into the mind of a person that is a bit more evil then most people are and his actions can be frightening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a well directed film.   It has a very interesting story line.  The characters were well developed and it had a very nice and interesting sound track that fit in the movie nicely.  There is a few people that may have been a bit over rated and that would have been an easy criticism to make but I really felt that the people that were in the film were well written.  I really liked the cast of characters and the actors that they worked with.  Also the music that was in the soundtrack fit well in the overall plot line of the film and that was really nice to listen to.  This is a really good film with a unique theme song and great acting that made the film fun and enjoyable to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of us who are old enough to remember the old days when black and white had a different meaning, this is a very good movie. The whole thing is about a police officer who has a girlfriend who is the perfect girl. When they go out to a party where they are both going to be alone, her mother shows up with her. She seems like a normal girl at first. She has a great smile and is dressed very well. When she is about to leave, she kisses him good-bye. As a boy would, he starts to walk away. It's a very sad scene. The next morning, he is back at his house, where she is with her mom, her brother and a few other people. At that point, the cops show up and they are all very upset. But the boy is the best of the family, so they decide to talk things over and that night they have sex. They talk a lot about what they like about each other, which is all fine, but then he brings up his daddy and he says he is so nice to his girl, and he is really smart. They decide to go to bed together. When he is still asleep, the mother walks in. She sees his bed and says she must give him something special, so she takes a ring, puts it on the finger of her son and walks out the door. The mother has an idea: instead of putting the ring on the son's finger, she will make him a boy. She gets a sewing machine and makes a girl. It is not long before the mother starts to have sex with her son, and to her great surprise, she finds he is a boy, too. After that, they go to the dance and then to the prom.   The mother does not like being a girl and tries to run away, but the boy stays with her and when he gets out of the prom, they do not have sex, but he does start to talk to her about being a boy as if he really liked it. Eventually, she gets tired of being a son and tells him she is going to take him to a doctor. The girl is now a mother. Her husband leaves her. The boy starts to tell his friends about his new girlfriend. She asks him to come over and they make out.  The police have found out about the affair, and so they arrive at the house, but when they enter the house they find the child lying

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is pretty good, very much like a good old 90's movie, it's pretty cool, fun and action packed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First and foremost, I must say that this movie, though not a masterpiece by any means, is a fun movie to watch and a nice addition to the franchise. In some ways, this is a bit similar to the first movie in the series, only it's a bit shorter.   The premise of the movie is that a group of people who have been "lost" for some time decide to start their own travel company, and their adventure begins when they are hired by the mysterious Dr. David Atherton to find the lost treasure of the last king of England, Arthur. They soon discover that the treasure is not as it seems to be, and a variety of other adventures ensue.  I'm not gonna say that I didn't like the movie in particular. It's fun, well written, and has some good effects. In the end, it's just sort of a one-sided adventure with a lot of twists and turns.  If you haven't seen it yet, watch it. It is a great movie to bring back memories of the first film:  Also worth a watch is The Secret of NIMH. It's a similar story, but with more characters, and much better effects.

It's quite good but it's also good at times and good at other times too. It has good dialogues and good action scenes, too. This movie is well worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really good movie. When I was a kid, there was a kids' show called "Tiny Toon Adventures." It had some pretty silly shows like "Mister Rogers" and "Dinosaur Train." This one is a little more of a comedy. It isn't very realistic. It uses a little science, but I feel it doesn't get too out there, which is good. The only problem I have is with the "Mighty Tiny" character. He's a little annoying and it seems like he's a total clod. You should probably read the book instead. (hide spoiler)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always liked the movie The Great Escape, so I was looking forward to seeing it again, as I've enjoyed a few of the other ones. The main theme is a very common one: The way we react to the situation depends on what we are trying to accomplish. A bad situation can be avoided if we just do the right thing.   The characters are the same as before. They are a group of inmates (the good guys) who are sent to an island for a job. Unfortunately for them, they are given a job that the island doesn't actually have the job for, so the bad guy escapes, and a prison riot ensues. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is really fun, as expected from the author of "The Hobbit" trilogy.  The book "The Fellowship of the Ring" tells of a journey of a young wizard who sets out on an amazing quest with his friend Samwise Gamgee (played by Elijah Wood) in the legendary lands of the ancient kingdom of Rohan.  When Samwise is captured by the evil King Theoden of Rómenna (played with great gusto by Geoffrey Rush), Frodo must travel to the farthest reaches of Middle Earth in search of his friend and journey to the lands of his ancestors in order to rescue his beloved.  Tolkien is a very imaginative author and has a lot to say about the nature and purpose of human existence.   It's not that I don't enjoy this book, it's just that I'm still in a great deal of pain from a bad cold.  A cold so bad that my nose would run so I could hardly breathe.  For the sake of this review I'll go over the main plot points:  The main character Samwise has gone missing in the Shire and it's up to a group of friends and dwarves to search for him, which is quite an adventure considering the size of Middle earth is.    Samwise (Elijah Wood) and his friend Frodo (Sean Astin) set off for the Shires in the company of Gollum (David Prowse) and a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) who they find on their way.  After a journey through the Shirshins Hills the group finally reaches Rivendell (also played in the film by Elijah and Sean).   After a while Sam is captured. Gollumb and Glamorgan are both evil and wicked countries, and so is Rivendel.  Sam has a special ring with him that has the power to open a door to Mordor, which means the evil Sauron can enter Mordor if he wants to, but in the meantime the Hobbits try to escape and help Frodo.  Gandalf the wizard of the house of Elrond (played admirably by Sir Ian McKellen), has been sent to the Shivering, but cannot go on because his lungs are failing.  As the movie goes on it becomes apparent that Mordor is an evil place, and the only hope the Hobbit and Frodo have is the "Ring of Power."  The magic

It's catchy but not overdone or over-played, just perfect and you can never get tired of the music in this movie.

If you are a fan of the horror genre then this movie is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, a good time.   The movie starts off very strange.  This is the first movie that I ever saw where the narrator, or the main character has no face.  It is more of a a face with a helmet and an empty eyes.  The story is about a man named Dave who is lost in the woods of Canada after falling down a waterfall.  Dave must find his way back home.  His journey is made very confusing because a few of the characters are only a couple of feet tall.  He eventually encounters a beautiful lady named Molly who is searching for Dave as well.  Their adventures will include a few funny moments and a whole lot of fun.  I gave this movie 5 stars because I think it will be remembered for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest problem I had with the movie is how the script was so bad (and the story would not have gotten out of its own way if it had been written by a competent writer).   I was a huge fan of the film and loved it as much as I loved its predecessor but I was really not blown away by this film.   As a first time film director I feel it should be taken more seriously.  In this movie the camera moves in a confusing way and I thought it made things more difficult than they needed to be.  I love the acting but it just seemed like all the actors had the same voice and it made it seem like each one was being used to fill the roles the director could not fill.  There were a few other problems too like a couple of scenes that seemed to be taken straight out of a "Twilight" novel.  The only good thing about this movie is the beautiful score and I love when a movie is based on music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has some great scenes that should be seen by everyone.   It's a simple story, but with a lot of humor and action that is worth watching.  Some things about this movie are odd and may seem strange at first.  It was filmed in Poland so there are a few strange sounds and pictures here and there that will be hard to understand at first, but it's easy to get used to after a while.  The film is about a bad guy who is planning an underground nuclear bomb. His plans are a bit over the top. But he's a nice guy and he tries to make everyone around him happy.  A couple of bad things happen to him while he's preparing this bomb. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I love the theme song of The Little Mermaid, this theme song for The Little Prince is just as great. It also has the wonderful "Disney sound" in it!   I also love the music and it makes me want to "move" throughout the movie.   The little prince wants to "take me to the world of imagination" so we can see his world like a fairy tale.  But there is a little problem:  The Little Princess has a small "brother" who doesn't want to be a part of his kingdom anymore...but not even a world can prevent a prince from loving a little princess.  So what happens next is just delightful: ! When the little princess says to the "little prince" "Why don't you come and take me to my kingdom?   Well, what a beautiful little kingdom!  "   You should really watch this one.  The characters are very likable and if you like a little fairy tale I think you will like this movie too! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I feel like a complete idiot but what the hell  " A lot of people love this movie, but i really think the reason it doesn't get the credit it deserves is because it's not a comedy. The movie is very depressing, not just in it's subject matter, but its mood. It's a very sad movie that is full of bad situations and terrible things that happen in a way that doesn't seem to be a comedy at all. It almost seems like a dream at some points. It does seem to come off as a comedy in the end, but the movie takes a long time to actually reach that point.   If you like this movie it's a good one, if not, then I'm sorry you didn't get it.   …

The movie is about the life of a kid who is going to the zoo in Africa with his parents. The zoo has a lot of animals and they are all so cute and cute they are not dangerous but are rather cute. The parents go through the zoo and one day their son starts to get bullied by the other kids. His father is a very good person and he tries to find a solution to stop the bullying. He takes him to a psychologist who is a really bad guy. He has a bunch of other kids like him but they don't seem to care and they get away with it. At the end of the movie he gets his ass kicked by his father and he takes it out on the children.  So he takes the kids in a cage and he makes them eat the zoo animals. He puts them in a box with a bunch others of the kids and they have to eat each other.  A couple of other things I liked:  -The parents are nice.  -It looks like they had a lot more fun going to Africa than my family did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an original and entertaining movie that has no bad side effects. The plot is unique and has some good twists. It's funny in the beginning and gets more serious as the movie goes on. The action scenes are really well done. I liked how they didn't go all out and just went with the flow. It was an original plot that you won't find in other movies. I think I'd recommend this movie to all the action movie fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think that it's really "good" at all.   But I like it anyway.  It's about a little girl named Sally who's taken to a school for a spell, but what Sally doesn't know is that it has some strange creatures in it.  The movie is about as bad as they get. It's just horrible.  There's no suspense, nothing good about it. It just goes on and on and then it suddenly gets really good.  This movie just keeps on going, getting better.  I like movies like this, even if they are bad.  And I'm going to watch the remake and see if I like the story a little bit better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a great time watching "Zombieland." I loved the movie so much. I laughed throughout the movie. The movie is fun and filled with lots of action. I love the music in this movie. It is also the soundtrack that I am most excited to listen to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a little dull in the beginning and only gets better from there. The cast and the story is very funny and the music is great. I love the movie and would definitely watch it again. I also really enjoyed the ending credits and the movie's characters, especially the characters who have sex in the end.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie. There are a few things I'd change. First, I think a little more should have been done to make it more interesting. For example, the main character doesn't seem to be very good. I mean, he's been taught that women who have had an abortion should be killed. He doesn't want to kill them. He's a good kid, but it seems that he's not ready to do what his father wants. For instance, one scene that really bothered me was where he finds a woman who has been through a lot and thinks she might be his mother. He tries to get her out of a house she's in and she keeps saying, "No! No! No!" But she does turn out to be his real mother. I didn't mind that scene, but that one scene could have been more well done. Second, I'd like to see the mother and the daughter more. I think that it would have been easier to relate to the son. I liked him. He was not the worst son I've ever met. He wasn't a loon. He seemed like a decent person. But I thought that the mother was a little unbalanced and the kid wasn't much better. But maybe I have to change my mind about that because the boy was funny. It's a little hard to understand if you're not from there or aren't aware of the culture. He had a good line in the movie: "I didn't like my mother, so I didn  read a book about her." That seemed really good to me. It also seemed to be an answer to his father's question about why he doesn't kill her. But then I realized he didn't have a father to answer that question with. But he does have a mom! You can't have too many of those in a movie, I guess. And I like how there were a lot of funny scenes. But it was a real shame that the movie was almost too long. It was almost an hour long.   In summary, this was a good film. If the story didn't go on for too long, it could have had a much better ending. It would have helped the movie out a lot if they had made it a little longer. But for me, I liked it a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you have been waiting for a long time for an installment of this popular series and you have a great group of actors in the cast and crew then this film delivers the goods.   It is a well done movie with a great story and some decent performances.  It really is a unique and unique movie with an original concept and some fresh ideas which is a plus in my book.  And the movie is very entertaining.  A few scenes do feel a little out of place, but most of the movie takes place in a futuristic world where the people can not only survive but thrive. The movie is also an eye opener with an intelligent and entertaining cast and the world they inhabit and the characters they have to deal with are very interesting.  This movie is a must see for those who have already seen the TV series or any of the other movies of this series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife, who is a medical professional and is a really big fan of the movie, said it was the best horror movie she's seen in awhile.    It's one of the very few movies that manages to give you nightmares at the same time as a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am surprised that I liked this movie. I mean, it looks like an old-fashioned B movies. They are full of clichés. You can't help thinking that someone is hiding something. They make you feel like you are being watched. It was just so predictable. I was looking forward to seeing a remake of A Clockwork Orange. I would be disappointed if the remake doesn't resemble the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed the first movie so much that I wanted a sequel.   This one is much better than the first.  I was expecting to see some changes from the first and not a whole lot of them but we have a new main character.  The story starts out with a girl (Ashley) who gets a job as a prostitute (a job that requires more money and more skill than she has) and falls in love with a man (Danny) who works in the same field.  Ashley finds out that Danny has a big penis and Ashley falls in to a deep funk.  She starts having affairs with different men including a rich man (Philip) who is looking for a way to make a fortune off of the sex trade.  Ashley and Phil start to make enemies by running around the city doing things that go beyond what normal people would think.  While Ashley's and Phil's romance is blossoming they must hide out and avoid being caught.  It all seems to be happening to all the right people and Ashley and Phil are just caught in the middle.  There is even an appearance by a familiar villain from the previous film.  This is probably the best film in the series, with a lot of new elements thrown in.  Even though it is mostly about Ashley and a guy named Danny and a lot is about sex there is a lot in it about friendship and the importance of family.  As with the first I thought this film is better but the changes were subtle.  Overall this was a good film and I think it is worth watching if you enjoyed the last one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie. This was a wonderful movie.   It was just the right balance of fun and realism.  You get the story of a high school student being recruited by the police.  It is one of those movies where you laugh, cry and learn a lesson.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable movie, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has seen one of the great movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie last night, and I was very impressed with it. My favorite characters were the twins who were so cute!   They are very happy.   Also, I love a good mystery, but a good and original movie was needed for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie a lot and it was a good idea to have a horror movie in this movie series about an American who travels to a European country in search of his son and he is chased by a woman with a long red fingernail that is an immortal and very hungry.   This movie is also about a man who is in love with a man with a lot of luck in life, in fact I thought he was a nice guy and would be a good husband if I ever get the chance to marry one but I guess that is because I was afraid of dying of a heart attack.  I just enjoyed this movie and I was able to see a lot more than what I was expecting to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had a great time with this film. It is very strange. I mean, if you go in expecting to see a film about a guy who loses his leg, you're not going to like it. And if you expect to see the film to be funny or even to be good, you won't. But if you want a film to feel strange, then this is it. You might feel as though you are watching something you have never seen before. It starts off with the weirdness of the way that the main character is dressed. It doesn't look like a regular prosthetic leg, but more like a kind of rubber hose that you see at the gym. The prosthetic isn't quite what I would call "bionic", but it sure does look pretty. And I love that they did this, because it's pretty interesting. The movie also takes place in a hotel room, because that's what the guy has to look like for a while. Then we get the weirdest dialogue you can ever have in a movie: you have a guy talking about the old woman who had a hand, and then a lady in a blue dress who is talking about how the man can't stop talking about it. It's so much more entertaining than I expected. I know that it is supposed to be a kindle book, but it definitely looks better than a normal paperback.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off with a lot of exposition in the beginning of the movie. That's where the movie starts to shine. Everything from the setting to the characters to the story is amazing. There is a feeling of familiarity here that is definitely enjoyable. The movie takes place during a winter and it does not let go until the very end. It's a good feeling to be able to take a deep breath and enjoy a winter day.   I loved this movie because of how many different themes it tries to convey. It does not shy away from expressing how much of a big deal it is to be an adult and be able talk to other adults. It also seems to be a story about a man's struggles to find himself as a man and what that might mean in this time of "The Greatest Generation" and it deals with many different aspects of people and how they relate to each other. The way the movie handles the ending was great. It was a quiet ending to a nice movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not bad and in fact very good. The movie is a story about a young couple, Alain and Marie, who are on a road trip. On the way Alain meets a girl named Marie, whom he later realizes is not a girl but a woman. The two then spend the night in the small town of Pont de Neuf. In the morning, they are forced to leave Pont de Nueve by their chauffeur who has been fired by a local business person. After being told about the car's problems the couple returns to Pont de Ville, where they find that a new car has been built for them. The first night in their new home is filled with joy and excitement. In fact, it is such a great day that Alain has not even been to his favorite French cafe before. He and Marie get so drunk they start singing and dancing, much to the disapproval of Marie's father, who has come to take away his daughter. Alain's father makes sure that his daughter and Alain are not to leave, as it is his duty to watch over them. They both drink too much and soon both start to feel the effects of the alcohol, but by this time Marie has left Alain, and the two sleep soundly. But when a storm comes up in the night, they go to find a hiding place, but have to hide at the house of the old man who raised them. And there the storm begins! The storm destroys everything, the house, the cars, the trees and trees, even the snow. Soon they all become frozen, except for the house. When the storm subsides, they wake up to find themselves at a lake, and in the middle of the lake is a small boat. The old man, who is now a little old and very sick, has found a ship with a few old passengers aboard, who also are frozen, along with Marie and Aline. They begin to walk towards the sea, and are captured by a group of people. Alaine is separated from her father, and becomes his new bride. The group is led by the man who owns the restaurant, who had also hired the girl who made a fuss about the two boys' drinking. When Alain discovers that his mother has also been kidnapped, and they have no place to go, they run for their lives. But as the storm hits them and they are unable to get out of the storm, they can only

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot has a lot of potential, and it will probably be able to pull a few good laughs in the middle.   But the characters are so incredibly unlikable, I wish they would die in a fire and never existed again.  They are so pathetic that I could not even bring myself to laugh at their stupid, pointless antics.  The ending is a joke.  For starters, they are forced to have sex in a bathroom with a huge rat in the corner.  And there is a scene where a man asks a woman what she did to make his friend cry (she gave her a blowjob), and he replies: "I made her cry, she never cries.  In a sequel about a man and a woman in a sex club, the man (the author) comes across some "unladylike" women and they decide to have a threesome.  I hate this movie.

The movie is about their relationship and how they help eachother with many challenges. The story is very simple, but the story is a very good one. The best part about this movie is the music. There are songs that you will listen to all the time, that will bring you back to the time of your childhood. The voice acting is good and you will feel the emotions of the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, this movie is a great way to start off the new year. I'm glad I gave it a chance.   The movie is well-made, but there are some glaring flaws that kept me from being able to be really into it. The movie starts off with a great opening, where you are introduced to some characters, but the movie doesn't really get going until the movie's end. I mean, it's not a bad movie by any means, but it's far from being something I can get excited about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - - -  -   (The movie starts out with the narrator saying, "a boy has a vision.")   I was in high school at the time, and I thought, this must be some kind of fantasy movie, because I don't see much fantasy in high schools. The movie didn't set out to be a fantasy movie though, but rather a dark comedy, a comedy that takes place in a high school.   The characters were all pretty normal, I wasn't particularly bothered by any of them.  I didn't find anything too outlandish about any of the actors either.  One of the characters is a boy named Johnny, and he is the main character of the movie.  He is a poor student, who is constantly bullied, and hates the bullies, but he is too cowardly to do anything about it.  Johnny is a hopeless romantic, and his first love, who I shall call Emily, is the only person in the world who seems to like him.  There are four other characters, each a boy who has a different relationship with Emily.  The two best friends are Jimmy, who loves Emily, and Johnny, who doesn't seem to care about anyone but Emily. The fourth character is the obnoxious jock, Davey, who seems like he has no respect for Johnny, but I don a find him to be an interesting character.  And I must say that the writing of the script was extremely strong.  It is extremely funny, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Each scene is short and to the point, and the script makes you laugh.  What it lacks in detail, it makes up for with humor.  (I must say, that the movie doesn't hold your hand, it tells you what's happening, but then it tells an awesome story.)   And finally, I should say that this movie has a nice ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I think of a fun movie, this would have been a fun one. I was expecting a little more, a little bit of comedy, a bit of action, a few surprises... but, this is pretty much exactly what you'd expect. The plot is pretty easy to follow, a man who doesn't seem to be able to leave the house, spends a lot of time by himself and doesn't come across as the most attractive character in the world. The story is mostly told from his POV. And it is very good.   It does take a little longer to get into the meat of the story, and it does take some getting used to, but once you get there, it is really enjoyable.  It is a simple plot and nothing too complicated, but it is done in such a clever way that you never get the feeling that the film is going to be too boring.  What makes this such a good film is the cast. We have the usual suspects of the movie, but there are a lot more.  We get a number of women to play the role of the man's love interest (although I was very surprised to find that most of them are female), some of the most memorable of the many bad guys we have seen, and of course the occasional appearance of a good guy.  The film is a very good comedy that is also very entertaining.  This is a film I'd recommend to those who like the simple and the humorous, and who like their humour.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A pretty good, yet cheesy, movie about two brothers, who are also brothers. They are both from the same town and come from a wealthy family. They both seem to have trouble with girls. One is a genius, the other seems to be a loser.   This movie does have a good plot. It is the story about a man, who has a brother that has a girl, who is also his sister. He falls in love with her and they are a pair of twins.  There are a lot of funny lines in the movie. The whole movie has a good soundtrack that adds to the movie a great deal.

If you are looking for a good sci-fi movie this is a great movie and the movie would work just fine as a television movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember being surprised at how much a great movie can do when it is set in a real world setting, however, this is a very generic movie and one of the worst of the "comedy" genre. There is a lot of silly characters here and there, including a clown named Jim (John Lithgow) and his wife (Rene Russo) who has a big fat tongue that comes out while she is pregnant. The plot is quite weak. They have some sort of car accident and a policeman (Jack Lemmon) and Jim are separated. Jim decides to drive to the city where they want to have their baby. They go to a hospital where he finds a room that is too big for Jim and the mother (Sally Field) who is very pregnant. Jim gets the baby from the room and gets the car back and leaves. Then the movie is over and there is some silly music and a little bit of action. It has a lot more charm and humour than this, but it is nothing special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll say this movie really is a gem:  It doesn't try to be some type of sci-fi epic, it simply follows the story of a poor family (the son is in the military) who decide to go camping by a lake to see the sunset.  As the family is relaxing and watching the sunset, a strange thing happens.  What appears to be a giant lizard that resembles a crocodile lands nearby.  It goes on eating everything and everyone who tries to get close.   At first, the family and the group of friends try to leave, but all of a sudden, they find out that they aren't really human.  A man (played by a famous comedian) is found dead in his own home, and the entire town is overrun with strange creatures.  The family begins to struggle to stay alive as this creature begins eating people.  This is one of those movies that really hits it's mark on being an effective horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little skeptical about this movie. I thought it was going to be another silly little comedy. However, when I finally watched it I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but it's a lot of fun.   You have a character named John F. (Bill Murray) who is in a restaurant and doesn't have a job. He does, however, have a large bag of money and lots of money to spend.  He has a girlfriend who he starts to date and as they get to know each other the relationship progresses into a romantic relationship.  However, she soon decides to leave him and he is devastated. He starts to have dreams of the old days when he would just drive his truck through the city and get his own way.  So his dreams become increasingly more violent and violent. One day his dream ends when a very strange looking creature attacks him. He is then able to fight it off, but is injured in the process.  After a brief time off to recover, John is working for the police department in a small town and is looking forward to having a few good old fashioned days. However he decides to get back to his old life and tries to get into the good old days again.  Unfortunately, his dreams end up coming true in a rather violent and horrific way. The movie's story is well written and all the action scenes are well animated and very entertaining to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that this movie is a perfect example of how to make a movie that not only entertains you but also leaves you wanting more. The cinematography, acting, plot, action, etc. are all top-notch. The sound quality is a bit weak at times but that is more to do with my speakers.   The soundtrack is just the icing on the cake. The movie has a very intriguing plot, a twist that keeps pulling you in, the characters are all different, the pace of the movie is just perfect, and the ending is the icing.  This movie is worth every dollar and is a MUST SEE.

The guy was a little nuts but I   wouldn't say he was  a bad guy, just a crazy one.  It was a good time.  The first 10 minutes   were hilarious and  the last 3 were scary, but I think it   came to a   close really quickly, so I was left thinking  . I enjoyed it.    I didn't really like it,  but I wasn't disappointed.  I guess that's the difference between   movies like   or  and the ones that I love.  My rating: 3/5   The movie was really enjoyable, but   it had a little bit of a silly theme and the ending was not the best...I would've liked it better with a bit more time to develop things. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of this movie is just as you would expect: a couple has a heartwarming romantic dinner with a group of people. They have an argument, which is when they start kissing and having sexual intercourse. The main problem is that the group of men have an interest in these two, who are about the same age and are friends with each other, so the plot twists and turns a bit too fast.   There are some good songs and characters in this movie.  I will tell you this though. It isn't really a good watch.  It is really only good for its heartwarming story and some good romance scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I liked this, I liked it a lot," was the reaction of a friend when we first got to know it. "You know, it's a little too real," said a woman on a train. "It really does feel like this," said another. "Not that I want this to be a documentary or anything, but the realness of it, the way the characters are trying to make their way through a real world, makes me believe that people are out there, really going through something." I liked this; I liked the realism of it. The realism of what? The reality of the film is one in which a group of teenagers try to survive in a small town. A real small town! There's a movie theater where people go to see movies: "What do you want for a good night's sleep?" a woman asks a teenage girl. "A good night of sleep is what I want," she says. In a real small world! A small world where the townspeople live in a world of their own: the big picture is just one more feature of this world, just one of the many things which they want and do, one of their ways of looking at things: "I see things as they are, they don't look much different." "What about things that look different?" "They don't have the same taste as I do." "There is a difference between us." "A difference?" "A very, very big difference. And we like each other very much." The difference is that there is something in them that's not human. This, too, is a world in which there are different kinds of people: the old, the young, the rich, the poor, those with disabilities, those who are too fat to walk and those who can, as the film title says, "walk as well as talk." The townspeoples, however, don't mind: "We got so used to it, we never thought of a way to get out." The big picture: there's a big picture! There are the stars! The stars of the movie are all dead: "She was only a child." "She only became a child at the age of ten." "At the age when a child has the greatest sense of what is proper and proper is when they are not even a child anymore." "I used to think that I knew it all. Now I feel that I don't. And that's bad

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   The action scenes are well done and I loved the look of the villain.

It's a good horror movie and I would love to see it on a larger screen in a theatre.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those wonderful movies that I can't get enough of.   The only thing I wish was done a little differently is when the police officer calls the suspect a murderer after he takes a knife to a guy and stabs him in the head, there is a scene where a female is watching the cops interrogate the suspect (I didn't notice that during the movie) that had some interesting scenes.  I've also read that in another remake, a movie starring Paul Newman and James Caan about a cop and his female partner who have sex together, they made it into a big hit.  The ending was a little sad to me and I wish that they had gone with a different ending instead of the one they did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First and foremost, the director of The Godfather is a master of his craft, making a classic in every respect. I think it would have been impossible to make such a film without the help of Robert De Niro, who not only did an excellent job, but was simply stunning throughout. Of course, this film would not have been possible without the legendary performances of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It seems like it's been over a year since I watched this movie but it's still good enough to warrant watching again. The movie is about a guy who lives on a boat with some very odd looking people. His name is Dave but everyone calls him Dave. The only thing weird about the movie is how the movie only takes place in one place. It has some very interesting sets like a room that has people with no clothes on. A room with a door that appears to be a hole in the wall. A girl who walks around dressed like a witch. And even the music...It's amazing! You really get a feel for how strange the movie was. It's like a movie with a bunch of strange people that just seem to come together from the weird things that happen. It was a weird movie at times, and there were some really cool weird stuff happening that kept things interesting for a while. I was never bored. The film's plot was kind of simple, but there were a few scenes that really left you with an impression. You can tell that the characters were really being drawn to one another.   I also had a great time watching this film. The performances were just amazing. I loved every single one of the characters. I thought the cast was all really great and really brought out all the different personalities. The production was also very well done. There were some cool effects like the blood on the walls from when a kid got stabbed in the eye. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the movie. I never really enjoyed the first one and even though I didn't see it, I watched it at least three times before I decided to watch the second one and I loved it!   The action is great! I think they should have used a gun to shoot the evil villain in the face.      Well I am off to watch a second one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie the other day, and it was pretty good. It had a pretty funny vibe about it, especially during the scene when the girl is about to be shot, and she decides to "do a slow walk." The guy doesn't think this is such a funny idea because he shoots it out the door, but you can't really blame him because it looks pretty funny. As soon as the girl gets out of the car, the guy says, "Hey, you're not dead yet, but this is probably a good idea." I know I've seen that scene in a bunch of other movies (the first three and a half were pretty good as well), but this was a pretty unique twist on the trope of a slow-walker. The fact that this girl was so drunk she wasn't even conscious when she got out of her car was a bit much to bear. The ending of this was pretty bad, but it was only the beginning of a great story with plenty of action and some nice humor to keep you laughing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the second film from John Carpenter I've seen. The first was The Thing. The movie is a good one. The film is set in an abandoned amusement park, and as you might guess, that's all it's got to offer. In this abandoned amusement. Well, they have a movie theater here. But there is no food here. No one is allowed inside. They have a bar, but no food. There is a few movies shown here. They are a few things that I liked, but nothing that I truly loved.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie at a movie theater in New York because I thought it would be cool to watch a movie about the Vietnam War on a train, but it actually is pretty good.   The movie is called "Hair of the Dog", and is about a Vietnam vet called David (Chris Sarandon). David has a very rough childhood. His father died when David was young, and he never saw him. David lives in a small New Jersey town with his wife, and dog, and they are not a very happy couple. David is trying to become a cop. This movie shows a man whose life has been ruined by the war, and is still trying to get over the fact that he lost his father and never got to meet him. The story has a lot of comedy to it. I think the movie gets a lot more realistic when you see it in the train station. I love the movie, and I really like David, and that is the reason I bought it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I liked the most is  The Lost World: Jurassic Park . I'm not sure why I liked it more than the others, except maybe the fact that I can see it with my own eyes. This was my second film about this subject. I did love the first movie (the first movie about dinosaurs was a disaster!) and I have to admit that I was hoping that the second movie would be a little better. I was very disappointed in the first film, which had a lot of action scenes, but not a whole lot of science behind them. It was a fun action movie, a very cute one, but nothing else. It wasn't as good as Jurassic Park but it was OK. Jurassic Park was my first film that I watched in high school (well, I was about 11-12 years old) and I loved it!   I hope to see more of these movies in the future! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's nice to watch a movie for the first time. I think this is a good remake of the first movie.    The director, Michael Fassbender has done a good job on this movie. It's a good story and characters and the action scenes are interesting.

It really is a beautiful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main plot is predictable but it's not that bad. The movie is a good, entertaining action movie. The action scenes are all good in the first part and when the action gets really good in half way the movie gets a bit silly (not in a bad way, not really, just very silly).   There's a scene where an assassin has a brief moment to kill a thug on the street. There's several close up shots and there's a nice sound effect, a car alarm. The guy is standing there while the assassin is about to kill him, the guy has a look of utter relief and that makes the movie really good.   A big, fat action movie, but it was not as good as I thought it would be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a nice movie this is. The characters are well-developed, and it is nice to watch a movie that is not simply about a boy who is being a bad boy (I never did like the bad boy), but is about a young girl who is dealing with a lot of things in her life. One scene where she runs down a hallway and is almost caught by a girl who was at that time a child is very interesting.   I like how they make use of a wide array of colors in their movie: I have never seen a movie as colorful as this one. It has great music too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this one at the Cinemark in Burbank. I watched this last night after a friend who was at my house. There was a little too much alcohol and a lot of the movie made sense to me after that. It is very sad and sad scenes were too often accompanied by a bad soundtrack. The story had the good parts, but I was not able to connect with any of the characters. The actors did a nice job.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this film, the characters of the group, Raul and Maria, are not just a couple. They are very much a couple, but that relationship is complicated.   It's been a couple of months since they started dating, and the film shows them living together.  Raul is a young, beautiful, powerful, intelligent man, and Maria is a beautiful, young, intelligent, powerful woman.  The relationship is very good, but it's complicated. Maria, who works in a bank, thinks that Raul wants to be married to her. She thinks that she is an inferior woman, who needs to find a man who will treat her with respect. However, Raimundo is very much attracted to Maria. He has a special affection for her and wants to marry her. This causes a lot of friction between Maria and Raul.  While Raul tries to convince Maria that she needs to get with someone who doesn't treat her like an inferior person, he finds out that Maria is really a special person, and that her true love isn't a man.  It can be said that this is a romance story about a relationship between two people who are very different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. It's got some very solid performances and is very atmospheric. I also like the story a lot, but it's very inconsistent. I didn't enjoy the first half that much, but the second half is more like the one I thought it was going to be. I can see why people who are into this kind of thing would like this, because it's got a good story, but a weak end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is just an okay movie. The cast is good and the story isn't bad, but the plot is too slow. I really wish they would have gotten something more out of that plot, like why did the boy want to become a vampire? What would happen if he went back in time? If he went to the past? Or why did he decide to go to an orphanage? Or what about his friend who became a vampire and is now looking for a new boy to become his heir? Or the other vampire who is looking for new victims? Why was he trying to go back to the boy? He doesn't even seem to care about the boy at all. But hey! The story is just okay.   And then it turns into a horror movie. This is a horror picture...the scares are too intense for the film to be good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't expect a horror movie like this to get any good reviews, but it did and I found it a nice movie.   This is one of the first horror movies I ever saw and I'm glad I did because it's one of my favorite horror movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would have given the movie more credit if it had been as good as the poster.   A good old film.  This is a very original film with a lot of very original ideas.  It is funny and silly at the same time and so unique and original that it is very hard to describe this movie.  The music is also quite unique.  As for the plot, there is a lot going on but I did not understand all of it.  At the same, it is well told and I did like the idea of a girl with a very strange past who is trying to escape to another place to help an injured friend and so on.  I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this is a fine film that doesn't get enough recognition.   The story is a bit complex and it was nice to be in a theater and be able to observe a bit of action and to hear a couple of good actors talking about a story that was told rather slowly, but with a sense of urgency.  I guess I'm just glad I wasn't the only young man at the theater that day because this film is one of the best action films I've ever seen.  The plot involves a former army officer and his wife who have a son, which is not a typical "father and son" plot line but that is what this film does well.  It gets into some of the details of war and how it affected soldiers and people on both sides.  This film is really well-acted and it is a pleasure to watch because the action is well-balanced and the plot is fairly well-developed.  There are a few scenes that don't really grab me as much as others but that's ok because they are the right ones.  As a viewer I can see that there are many good elements in this film and that a lot of good ideas were considered for a good, long film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of the first X-Men movie and I was thrilled to find this version of the story on DVD. I wasn't expecting a great movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.   It's a nice little story about two friends who are stuck at a party for their senior prom (as opposed to the actual prom of the actual movie).   The first act is fairly standard, but then things take a turn.  You should check it out if you are a big fan of X-men or superhero movies in general.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a few reviewers, I was a little apprehensive about this movie because I didn't like the last one. But this one was way better. Not to say this was a perfect movie because it wasn't. But it was close. There was a good ending and some of the things I've seen in other movies were in this one. It was also an original concept. There were elements of the old, creepy, "The Walking Dead" show, but the stories were very good. I saw this movie twice on video but still got a good laugh out of it. I'm sure this will be on my list of horror movies to watch for years to come.

There is a lot of comedy and heart, as well as an awesome ending. I hope that more people find the movie enjoyable!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second half of the movie is pretty much like the first. Not as good as the first half, but I still liked it a lot.   Part 3: The Unforgettable   There are some great scenes in this movie. The best one is a scene that opens with a big screen TV in a big theater. A TV playing a movie of a bunch of cops talking about how the bad guys are getting more and more desperate. Then they stop in the middle of the screen to show how the city is being taken over. The bad guys have gotten a bunch more guns and are getting ready to storm the city and kill everyone in it. This movie is the perfect mixture of action, adventure and romance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I watched it again last night with my father and the rest of my family, and everyone thought it was hilarious. This was my first trip to the zoo and I thought it would be fun to go and see how the zoo was doing, when we arrived, we saw some really cute animals and all, the whole place was adorable. I really thought it might be a little bit scary because of the lions, but they didn't even raise an eye, not a hint. I think the reason that it was so much fun was because of all the funny animals, I liked watching the zoo go crazy, and the way the guy in the lion suit was just acting really crazy. I have seen a lot of funny movies but I have never seen so many funny animals! It was great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, and this one has many good lines and moments that make it a pretty enjoyable film. As always with Star Wars, you can't help but enjoy it when Han Solo says:  It was a new world; I had never been outside of a Death Star, where the force was strong and the skies were the darkest and the coldest. In the distant horizon, a faint glow shone across the skies. I saw a distant ship that looked like it was from an old-time movie, but I could tell it wasn't the same old ship. It was much bigger, much more impressive; I could almost feel its strength, and I thought:  "It is going to be a long hard fight."   The characters don't really get along. Obi Wan has to admit he is a little out of his element. He is a master of the Force and does not think he needs to go to the dark side; he thinks he is "an old friend". The last few times I saw him it felt like the script was trying to make him look a bit like the character Darth Maul from The Phantom Menace, but we never see what happens to Obi Wan afterwards. It is pretty clear that this movie is the original trilogy on a film-by-film basis. The story keeps moving on, and we never get the characters to really grow up.   It is quite a pity that the original films were so much better than the prequels and that this one doesn't feel as good as the original. The special effects have some amazing shots, and if the characters weren't so wooden I would have loved it to be as good, if not better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had heard nothing but praise about this movie, and that was what I expected. It was actually a good film, with a great story, but the pacing was a little slow. I like a slow movie, so this made me feel that the movie makers had planned it all out so that it could be easy to watch. The plot was great, but I felt a little annoyed when the guy who was supposed to kill the monster at the beginning of the film suddenly said that he was too slow and didn't need to shoot the monster, instead the monster just shot him. However, the movie was good and I liked it. I hope to see more movies like this, so I can understand why this one was popular.   Catch Me If You Can   The main character is a bit dull, but if you look for things that are really special and unique, you will be able to find it.  The only thing that bothers me is that he is not an official monster.

One person gets killed and then the other person does the same.  The movie is all about how you need to stay on guard. I love how they had a big fight scene at the beginning that was pretty brutal.  I wish I was allowed to see the movie a second time, I got lost in it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie a long time ago, and then again just a few months ago. This is the fourth time I have watched this particular film.   The film is a simple but very effective story about a single mother and her three children.  In order to support herself, she sells odd jobs.  At a certain point in the movie, she learns that her children are in fact her real children. But she has to hide it from everyone.  This simple story is simple enough, but it is a very effective use of time.  It is funny at times, but not always.  The music is nice.  But the story is very simple and it is easy to follow, even though it is not as complex as some of the stories I have read.  I will give this a 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie, not only because of its humor, but also the performances of its cast:  The cast is well-done and well-acted. It really adds to the humor and fun of the movie.  It is very funny.    It really is a good, good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is the perfect movie for an after school movie. I have not seen the previous movie and it is pretty much the same as the previous. The plot is very similar but it does not hold up as well in comparison. I was also disappointed at how the main character changed so much.   What you should know about this movie: (1) the movie is very violent (2) it does NOT have any good songs (3) the best girl is the "macho girl". (4) I don't recommend this movie to people with no brains or no life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good flick. And it has a good soundtrack. It's got a real good twist to it as it's not about a hero going on a mission of some kind...it's more about him getting closer to the truth. In that way I would say it's similar to The French Connection (1971) except this time around we have two heroes trying to be close to one another...one of the other characters plays a bigger part to that.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a big movie buff, but this one was great! I like how it's more like a movie that's really fun, without any annoying plot twists.   If you like to make funny movies, then this one is perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was hoping that this was going to be a nice story about a normal guy finding a new job, but the story really takes a bad turn.   The movie seems to want to make it sound like there's some real story behind everything, and that's where the film's weaknesses lie.  We are given the story that this man has just lost his job as a butcher because his sister and father died when he was a kid.  The problem is that even though this is a story about someone's life changing event, there is little to no explanation to the events themselves, and the audience has no reason to invest themselves in the story.  It's clear that the filmmakers are simply setting up a plot in the hopes that we'll be willing to sit through the entire thing, but then once we've seen all the stuff that needs to happen, it feels pointless to go on to the next part.  This movie really needs some editing, and I've seen worse. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am going to try and talk about the movie to the best of my ability.   This movie is absolutely incredible, one of the best movie   It is a love story about two young women who go into a world of men they have never seen before, and they have no idea what to expect.  One of the girls is a runaway and the other is a tomboy who is an alcoholic.  They get into trouble with the law, get their lives thrown into chaos, and even get separated from each other.  A lot of people like to see two young girls go into dangerous situations and get them out in the nick of time, but this movie does not allow for that to happen.  Both girls are really fun to watch, but it's not funny at all. It's just sad. I was watching it with my sister and we had a great time.  I don't know if I will ever get tired of watching this movie.  The music in this movie is fantastic, the movie was like a musical but this one has more than just the usual number of songs.  This is a very well made movie. One of my favorite movies ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie and a good watch.   I like this movie because it is not a normal one but is based on a true story that happened to me.  When I was in high school I met a girl who I had no idea was going to marry my friend at the time. I met this girl at the beach one day and the only thing she was wearing was a thong with her bra on. I thought nothing of it and kept staring at her.  I was wrong. This girl was hot, sexy and had a hot body.  The next day she asked me for a ride and we ended up in my car.  She had one of her friends come in and he tried to seduce me but I told him no. When we got back to my house that evening she said that she did not like him and wanted to talk to me alone.  Later that night we went to the beach and I started playing a bit of guitar. She got naked, lay on my stomach and started sucking on my hard nipples.  At one point she grabbed a beer can and poured a little out and took a big hit. She started coughing so I gave her a break and got the beer.  After a while she started asking me to kiss her and I was hesitant.  Then she had me get out of the car and we started kissing and playing around.  Before I knew it, she was sucking on one of my nipples. It was then that she pulled off all her clothes and I guess she knew she had a good thing going on.  It turned out that she was a prostitute and I got her a place in the city so we could meet more people.  During our first night there we talked about her life and her dream of making a lot of money.  My life is a blur after that and I can only remember her as this great looking girl.  Her first job was to dress up like a nun and lead a small group of people into the church.  At one point during the group trip she had sex with me and I loved it.  We went to a small bar that turned into a motel to get high on crystal meth.  That night she got pregnant by one of the kids.  Once she was pregnant she moved out of my house to try and make a life for herself.  One day she went to this restaurant called the Red Onion where she told me that she wanted me to come over and help
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a good one with a good story, good performances and a good script. It has good performances from all around actors such as the main two lead, who is in my opinion the best, the leading male, who I found to be very realistic and to relate to the fact that you are a soldier of the army in a war against the Japanese. The other leading female is very good as well and I found her very funny and not too much on the side of the heroine. The plot is very original and very good. One thing that I like about this movie is that you never know what will happen in the movie, but you are always entertained by the performances, so it does not bother me that much if the movie does not go anywhere and is boring at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so good! I just came from a convention where it was playing for 2 hours.   In the first 40 minutes the movie is about a boy who finds his old school. It has been turned into a girls school.  The new girls (that arent there anymore) act like kids. The girl who had the best voice in the world has moved on and doesn't seem to be getting any better.  She has a boyfriend named John who is very handsome and she likes him a lot. John tells her she is "the best there is" and he says she'll be "the one who makes him cry". John is a terrible kisser and she ends up crying.  John is still a loser and is living in a trailer with his mother.  He goes to a party with a girl named Midge and gets drunk. After the party John thinks of someone named Bobbie. John goes to the bar and starts chatting with the girl. She asks John why he's there. John is very drunk and thinks of Bobbie for a few seconds before he realizes that she is a woman. He runs off to get a taxi.  Bobbie thinks that John is really drunk and she asks if he can take her home.  Her car is in a wreck and she needs to go to the hospital. Bobbie makes a deal with John. She gives him the key to the taxi she has and he can drive her home if he wants.  After John takes Bobbie home he says they will never see each other again.  They end up having a good time together.  What was so amazing about this movie is the characters. The relationships that were developing were very interesting.  I think this movie had a good message.  My wife likes this movie and is getting her friends together to watch it.  It is one of the best movies ever made and is a must see for anyone who likes funny movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen the movie "Fantastic Four" and I'm sorry I waited so long to see it. The movie has many good points.   The cast is great and the action scenes are well done.  But the problem I have with the movie is that it has a bad ending.  The characters that are introduced at the beginning of the movie (Gandalf, Wanda, Dr. Doom and Thor) all die in the movie.  This is a shame.  I don't feel it was done on purpose. I know that we are getting the film for the 50th anniversary but I feel that they could have done something with their ending to make the movie better. I am not sure if this was the intention but I think that we could have learned something about these characters.  Some of us would want to see a story about how they became heroes or about the time they lost a loved one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I'm a grown man," says a grown-up Paul Newman, a grown up George Carlin, a grew-up Sam Kinison.    George Carlin is, without question, the most gifted comic comedian in the history of the human race. I've been in awe of his comic genius for a long time, dating back to when I was a little kid who found a copy of the first season of the Sam Kinisons on a bookcase at my local comic shop.    "You see, you know," I said, "you have to do that to make people laugh, and if they aren't going to laugh they're not going to buy your comic books. And even if they don't buy your comics they still buy your records, and so on.  And so I just went and bought a book of the Kinisons.  " "I'm not making that up!" said my father, and he was right.  The Kinisons were my favorites.  I didn't know they were dead, and that was the whole reason I bought the book of them.  They're just so much better than they used to be, and they were the great thing about my comics store.  And I loved watching Sam KinISON perform.  He was an incredible entertainer and his standup set was simply amazing.  It wasn't a joke to watch him perform; it was a demonstration of what a truly gifted performer Sam KinIZ is.  This was the first time I'd ever seen him perform, and I loved it.  In fact, I had been looking forward to seeing Sam perform, because I wanted to see how far he would take this kind of thing.  What you see is what you get with Sam Kinisson.  His live show, the standup show, is simply incredible.  To this day, when I'm feeling down, and my self-esteem is low, I look at Sam KinISSison and I think:  "I don't have to be so miserable.  Here's a man I can laugh with!  Here I can take a joke!"  If there's one thing you need to know about Sam Kinason it's that he makes people laugh.  Every time I see him, I don't feel like a loser; he makes me feel like I'm the winner.  Sam has an incredible ability to make a crowd cheer and clap and clatter
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did a lot of research for this movie before watching it.   It is set in a small American city called Portchester in 1864.  There are a lot more things going on in this town then many other small American cities.  The town is full of all kinds of people and you don't even know which part of town you are in.  All the time I was watching the movie my heart beat faster and faster.  I thought the movie would start slow but it didn't.  In fact when the movie started it was very funny.  What was even funnier about it was the two detectives played by George Murphy and Harry Morgan and a friend played by Fred E. Brown who were trying to catch a guy they called the "Wrap-around-the-Ear Man".  He was caught by them and then he tried to kill them and they had to kill him.  This is what I thought about a lot.  He seemed like a real mean old man.      So if you are looking for a good action movie then this is the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a few things that make this movie special. First, it does a good job of setting up the story, showing all the characters and their motives. Second, the soundtrack is a great soundtrack and it is easy to understand how it is used in the movie. Third, a small character is not wasted and the last bit of the movie is enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new classic.   You know why? Because it is a fantastic film, and a real family affair.  This is not like the old days when the stars of a movie were just the actors. This is about an actual family, complete with a grown-up and his son and his friends.  These kids are not bad kids, but they do have bad attitudes.  They are not evil per say.  The only bad thing about them is that they have the right to be.  I love the way they are brought up, they are very well read and intelligent.  It reminds me of how the little people get brought up in an upper class, all-white society.  As a matter of fact, it reminds me much of what you think a "middle class" family looks like.      I did not read the book, but this film made me want to see it, and I have seen it a number of times.  You have to see this movie, or you are missing out on a great family movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is about a small family which has to leave their hometown in order to get a place to live. They live in a small, very ordinary home. However, they have a very strong relationship with their neighbor. The neighbors have a daughter who they want to raise up like the kind of little girl they used to have back in the old times. They believe that their daughter is a good girl and that she will be a great, obedient child. However when she is eight years old, she goes to the big city for the first time. But she is brought by her father to a family where she is not welcomed. In the beginning she has a hard time finding her footing and is very disappointed that her new house is not what she expected. She gets a job, but it is a dead end. She is constantly having to work in order for her family to survive. Eventually she does find a place where she will get a chance to live a normal life, but that is soon short lived. She has some problems as she tries to figure out what kind of a life she has and who she will really be in.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A short movie, about a small town in the mountains where, one day, a strange man shows up in a strange town and starts killing people in a very peculiar manner.   The film is interesting because of the very peculiar behavior of the person who shows up and his bizarre behavior.  From the moment you see the strange man, who is dressed in white, who looks like a giant white cat with a white tail and a very strange head, you immediately think that he is a very abnormal person and you wonder how can someone who looks so crazy come to this small small town.  The movie is funny because of that.  He murders people by jumping in front of them and is very eccentric.  Some people were killed just by looking at him in a bad mood.  But it is not all bad because at the end of the movie the man finds out that he does not have to kill the innocent people and, therefore, he becomes a little bit sane.  It is a little like " The Exorcist" because some people do not believe in demons but the guy who has killed all the people does and he, himself, believes in them.  This movie is good for a nice quiet time in your house when you can sit in a corner and watch this film with a cool drink while watching your favorite scary movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit that I was quite intrigued by this movie.   The film has great action sequences and great sets, but I don't really care about that.  Instead, I want to talk about how I felt about the character of J.J. Abrams.  What a fantastic character he is.  J. J. Abrams is a very nice guy and I can see how hard he worked to create his own version of Luke Skywalker.  He managed to make him seem like a slightly arrogant, slightly snobby teenager who is very intelligent and very good at his job.  I just like to see young men who are confident and willing to try their hardest to do something.  This isn't some weak excuse for a Star Wars fan movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a Star wars movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a real gem that is very similar to a lot of old and old great movies. I don't know if it is a "dubbed" movie because it is so good it could have been "original" (the movie was originally dubbed by a director who had an American accent and made all of his movie sound like he was in a movie theater) but that isn't even the part that is interesting in this movie. The interesting thing about this movie is that it shows the true dangers of the war in Vietnam (they would be better off not being there). I think a lot more people would have been made ill by what they saw in this "original-dub" movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie because I was told it was great and it was and still is and will probably be for a long time, it's got a good cast and a good story but some of the writing in it is pretty bad and makes the whole movie look like a work of amateur fiction, but it's still a good little comedy and a solid comedy to boot.   In one of the scenes in which a woman is trying to get up from a dead body, her husband (played by Don Knotts, played on the same show by Robert Duvall) asks: "How are you, my pretty, pretty little darling?" She says "Oh Don, I am very much alive" and they get back into bed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've had a few movies in my time but none as good as this one. It has a unique, unique feeling and you know exactly what's going on. This was one of the first movies I watched that was truly about a man's past (not in a bad way), and also a man trying to make his way through the future in a difficult and sometimes difficult environment. A little slow at the beginning and a little slow during, but really a well done movie. I have to mention that there is one scene when the man, and a couple of men, are being held up by armed guards. The men are being driven off at gunpoint, but the man is having to stand on a balcony to watch them off. There is a moment that the man looks at the balcony and notices a large white dog sitting there. This is another dog in his neighborhood that the neighbor's are trying to keep under control. I found that a real touching and touching scene.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't praise a movie like this enough. It's a brilliant comedy. It really should be a remake of the TV series.   There are some great moments in the movie and some funny moments but it's all about being a good guy to his friends and a great guy in general.  A great movie to watch with the family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had the great misfortune to be a guest at an event at a local movie theater. We decided to check out the new film "Ladies Man". It was the perfect blend of old and new, old with a little something new. I'm a sucker for old movie and old movies.   And a little bit about that movie: (From Amazon.com) Ladies Man is a biopic that follows John Grisham as he tries to get by as a struggling writer in Los Angeles during the post-WWII boom. Grishan is not quite sure what it's like to be able to write, but he is trying. He is having an affair with a woman he met on the subway, who he believes to be his long lost childhood sweetheart, Mary. But after a number of failed relationships, Grishman realizes that he is no longer in love with his childhood sweethearts, but has found a new partner in his late 20's, Carol. He soon becomes aware that Mary is dying of cancer, and he is determined to get her to the hospital. The film was directed by Paul Weitz, and stars John Travolta as John Grisham. Weitz also co-wrote the screenplay with Mary Lambert, and it was directed and co-written by Robert Aldrich.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The way I see it, a lot of people have made the mistake of getting a good book for the price of a good film (that might be a little harsh, but you get the idea).   We were all expecting to see a decent movie, but the movie was quite mediocre.   The main character, Mr. V, is played by a relatively unknown actor.  Mr. B does a fine job of portraying Mr. T.  B even managed to get into a couple of funny moments.  The dialogue was cheesy and forced.  But the main characters are very likeable, so this is not necessarily a bad movie.  I just wished they did not have to follow a "fantasy" script.  It had a lot more potential if the director was allowed to explore his ideas in a more realistic way.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the ending either.    I think the author of this book had an idea of what he wanted to do, but didn't know how he was going to do it, which caused the story to change several times.  This was especially true in the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very well put together movie, set in an ancient Egyptian tomb. The sound is a little bit out of this world. It is really cool.   My only complaint is that the movie is a bit too long. There is a nice amount of action and a cool ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this one as a "back to basics" movie. That's probably a better way to put it. This was probably the worst film I have seen in a while. There's just nothing here.   The "film" itself starts off like any other film from the 80's. A woman is murdered and then the police solve the crime. She is then brought back to life in a special laboratory to try and figure out what happened to her. The film then cuts to a woman getting killed in front of a group of people. The group includes a boy named Bill who is the only survivor. He's just a kid. He is then visited by the "woman in black" who wants him to help her. Bill agrees to help out because that's the only thing that will help her come back to her feet again. He goes along with the program for a while but soon it doesn't work. He has to do more "research" on her than the police did. He starts out with some "inspirational" stuff about "love". He learns she is dying because her soul is dead but she isn't dead yet. The woman in black then tells him that he has to find her the key to her resurrection. She tells him the secret to her revival and he does. He then goes to her, the old woman. The old woman is also dying. She has to die because her spirit is dead. She then tells Bill that she will have to kill him in order to complete the "research". Bill does.  The next scene is the old lady and Bill in her room. Bill puts his hand on her face and then pulls her soul out. He says "she is dead now". He then tells her that he loves her.  This is where the movie just kinda falls apart. The rest of the movie is just a mess.  For a movie with so little to do, it never seemed to care about anything.  There were so many "excuses" being made for this film. It had a "cinematic score". It had "special effects". It even had an "alien attack". None of it really added up to anything. It's hard to say if the "star" is just being used for the movie or not. It may not be all that great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are two things you have to keep in mind when watching The Hunger Games: 1. Every single one of the characters is a horrible human being, and 2. The writing is awful, it is extremely confusing and takes a long time to figure out what is going on.   It has been five years since the first movie, so it is very much a sequel to the first film. This one takes place during the time of the games and tells the story of Katniss (played by Jennifer Lawrence), a girl who is forced into a deadly game by the corrupt President Snow (played, by Michael Fassbender). Katn in the first one is a little girl who wants nothing more than a better life and to live in a nice peaceful town. She is always helping her mom when she is around, and she loves her sister and brother, Peeta (played as a pretty boy by Josh Hutcherson) and Gale (played again by Hugh Jackman). Kat decides to go to the games to see if she can survive the competition, and after being trained by Haymitch Abernathy (played once again by Josh, who was awesome in the second movie) she has one of those moments that every girl wants to have: When the Hunger Games starts. She wants to run in the arena, to see who is going to win. She has the courage to do it though, and eventually she wins the first Hunger Games (which was really easy, and it was nice to see Haymish play a pretty kid again). She doesn't survive, however, because during the games, a boy named Rue (played with the same amount of charisma as he did in the last movie) uses his "haunted" powers to cause a bunch of people to have an out of body experience, which makes the others forget who they are and where they are. Katn has no idea what is happening, and then the games start over again.  Unfortunately, Katn ends up falling in love with someone who is the head of the Hunger games and he convinces her to be his champion, so that she can escape the games.  What I liked: 1) Everything about Katnizs death was awesome. She just wants to live, she wants to be happy, she doesn't want to be tortured and die. She's a good kid who just wants a better future. 2) Haymash's performance in the previous movie was phenomenal, but this movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is typical of the old-school, though it's also unique. The film has the same kind of "couch" format as the film is made from. The story is about a young woman, played by the great Anna Karenina. She goes to work, gets her daily bread of bread in her mouth and gets a call from a mysterious guy who makes her feel alluring with his charms. He comes to her house to give her a present of a very expensive watch that she has never seen. He doesn't reveal who he is, but Anna decides to take him to a place where he can find more of those watches. He will also get something he will treasure and maybe even a girl who will give him a great love. A good story with some "out-there" situations that were never in my mind before.   So who are we looking for?   A movie for lovers of the great romances (I'm still searching for my love of Aja).   I really enjoyed the film and it's a good start for a great romance.

It's a simple story about a man who wants to do good and is able to do it when everyone around him is wrong. It is an easy watch that will make you laugh and cry. The characters are funny and likeable, but the real star of the show is Tom Hanks, who gives the best performance of his career. I was a little disappointed at the ending as it didn't really do anything that was good, but it was still a really good movie to watch.

The film was very slow paced with some good scenes but the story was a bit slow paced and boring.  A group of friends go to a small town to celebrate the birthday of the man they've met the night before, a man named Charlie. The movie was really good, especially with the acting. I'm thinking Charlie was the best actor ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing that can be said about this is that they got the right cast: a good mix of all-rounders, good characters, funny scenes, and of course one of the greatest lines in the history of movie making (at least since the days of "Chariots of Fire":) "What would you do if you found yourself in an elevator that was running down into a mine shaft?" I know it's a bad movie, but it has a great ending:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love sci-fi, think about this: you are watching a guy get his head torn off! Yes, it looks like a lot of effort and care went into making this movie and you don't feel the same way as when I watched the movie: it looks cool, sure, but it has no real feeling.   The movie is about a man who is lost in space and he meets a girl who was lost in time and he has to go back and save her!  It's interesting that the girl in the movie is from a different time, she's in the year 2000 and she seems a bit different to the man (I would like to think that she is the older girl). She calls him a 'robot' and he calls her a 'girl'. He's also a little bit different.  I liked the story.  The film also looks cool.  It reminded me a little of a movie called 'Gravity' but it is a lot less fun.  This movie reminds me of "Timecop" but it doesn't have the same humor.  There is a part where the guy is walking and a small guy comes up and gets all friendly with him.  Is this a joke?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am in love with this movie, and this movie is like the best kind of romance. I love love love all the characters in this movie. They all have their own personalities, but they are all so relatable. They are a group of teenagers trying to make a name for themselves. They have to fight against bullying, gang fights, and other problems in their high school. They start to lose their friends and they are on the run with the help of the new girl, a girl who is trying to find her place in the world. I think the story and the characters are amazing. I have only seen a few movies like this, and so far I love this movie with all my heart. It is really worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was made to bring awareness to the plight of poor farmers in India in the days of the British Raj.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about this movie (after being recommended it to me), I was expecting something terrible, and it was. My boyfriend and I were out on a date, so I wasnt in the mood to listen to a movie. We were sitting in a corner bar with a few other people at a movie, when all of a sudden, an ambulance appeared on the scene. There was a gunshot in the driver's seat of the ambulance, and as the paramedics tried to pull the driver out of the car, the driver, a lady, had been shot in the head. The people who were helping the driver try to figure out what to do, but before they can, a bunch of kids start running through the streets. As I was reading the directions to this movie, I noticed there were lots of scenes where a lady was just talking to a male character, and the guy just ignored the lady and kept walking. I was laughing out loud during this movie. This movie is not for kids. The violence in this movie is pretty graphic. The guy that has the gun in the car and he takes off with the lady in the ambulance is just a total bastard. I just wish the movie had stayed on a more serious note.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to see the movie about 3 months ago and it is just amazing.   The movie is about a big truck driver that is going to lose his girlfriend and his truck and that's a shame because he is really good at what he does.  He goes through a lot of difficult times with his girlfriend that's why the movie is called "The Hard Road to L.A."   It's a good looking movie too.  I thought the film was very well made.  It is a good job because it didn't try too hard to be a movie.  The acting was good too. It is an interesting movie and if you're looking for a good comedy then give it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most beautiful film I have seen in a long time. From the very first second I felt this film will be a masterpiece. I was amazed at the beauty in every corner of the beautiful and magical landscapes that were created for us to see and experience. The atmosphere of a mystical journey to a mysterious land is so rich that I was sure the whole story was filled with such a powerful essence and I couldn't help but to feel so much emotions from this film. The plot is so well thought and plotted that you can't help to be sucked into it. The story unfolds slowly without too much of a distraction but it has a great ending that you won't be able to see the coming of it. You will understand it and understand it well because it was done so beautifully.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie reminded me a lot of the original Superman. Superman was a powerful character who would fight anyone who threatened him or anyone who didn't do what he wanted them to do. The movie is very good and worth watching. It gives a good explanation of how the hero's powers work, how he is the "world's greatest detective" and how he was able to defeat the villain. The action scenes were very good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only thing that is "slightly" offensive is the "sex and violence" that is found in this movie. This is what the "new age" crowd is into these days. Not the sex and violence of a sexploitation movie. Not any of the "jokes". It is the sex, the violence and the "violence" that makes this movie a "must see".   I liked this movie as I found it to be a solid movie. It had great acting, and the violence is a little gratuitous but then so is this movie! I would not recommend this movie to kids, as it may not be for them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen a few other great movies on my trip here. This is one of my favorites. I've had it on VOD since January, and have been wanting to see it more. I think the cast is really good, and their chemistry is so natural and fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film tells the story of the life of an American citizen in Nazi-occupied Hungary, and the life and times of his wife and daughter during the time he was a prisoner. There are a lot of interesting and fascinating scenes of life and a lot that is dark. But as I said, there is a lot about the movie that is very interesting, like the movie about the wife's and the children's school. They take a class in the basement of a house where there is no heat and no electricity. The teacher takes the class and tells them that the house is a house of horrors and that the children are going to be killed one day. But then the wife, who is still in school, is caught reading a book in the bathroom of the house. The children are sitting on the floor and the wife has a book and is reading it to them. It makes a real psychological impression when you see a wife reading a murder mystery to her children. There is a scene in the film that is not easy to watch but I would say it is an important and tragic scene, where the mother is reading a poem to her child who then tells the mother that his sister has been murdered.   Another very interesting scene, is a man who is a Holocaust survivor who walks into a bar with a large picture of a German soldier and goes into a room where there are a number of people who are talking about what has happened to Jews in Europe. He then goes back into the bar and starts asking people about what happened to the Jews, and tells a man that his mother was murdered and then tells some other people what had happened.  The movie is not long but it has a lot to offer, the scenes are well acted, well made and very interesting and if you like a good thriller, this is a good one to check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of this movie.   It takes place in a modern day American city and is about a young man named Jim (Jonas Blue). Jim works in a big company with the help of his younger brother Mike (Peter Dinklage) and they go up to their building everyday. The brother's are good in school and Jim is a good friend. Jim and Mike have a lot of sex and have some bad days.  The movie is very funny, and the comedy is very good.  Some scenes are a bit difficult for me to watch, but the story is good, and I thought it was very good at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good. It is about a couple that go back to visit their daughter and her boyfriend, who have now moved on to a new home and are no longer together. While waiting for the couple to come out of the house, the husband is hit by a car, falls into a canal, drowns, and has to be rescued by the husband's nephew. He has a hard time getting up, but he recovers just in time to save his nephew and return to his new home.   I liked this movie. It was not perfect, but it was a good film and a good little film about a relationship. I like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In case you need a little more help, the movie was all about a boy named Tim. Tim was a high school student, who was a good friend of the family. In the movie, we see Tim and his mom try to take the care of Tim's younger brothers who were out at a club, but it doesn't work out as expected. Tim and some friends go to a carnival, where there are many strange characters. One of these characters is a woman who lives in the house next to Tim's, and her name is Wendy. There was a little bit of a bad blood between Tim and her, which is probably what made it interesting. I loved the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love a good story (or maybe just a good action movie), you should check out the latest installment of the Fast and Furious franchise.   While the story seems simple at first, it really grows on you after a while.  After the events of the first movie (which is a good one), there is a lot of chaos in the city of Los Angeles.  And while some of the main characters have been eliminated, a new gang is trying to rise up against the corrupt police force that is trying desperately to keep things under control.  In addition to the characters in this movie, we have a lot more action and more destruction than the first film.  While some of it is pretty awesome, the biggest surprise is that a certain car from the original Fast & Furious trilogy is still around in this one.  But while the previous films were fun to watch, Fast 5 is much more fun and entertaining.  Fans of the original series will probably like this one the most.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a bit strange to be reviewing a movie with so much in common with my all-time favourite The Empire Strikes Back (which is no secret) but at the same time a very different movie in the Star Wars universe and one I didn't see at the time. This one is a straight-forward action flick with the usual suspects. The cast is a good one, but not so great, the script is pretty good (although one-sided, although it is told from the point of view of the Imperials) and the special effects are superb. The special effects and set design are what really make this a special film, the story is also great (and a very well-written one, too!) and the dialogue is good, but there is no love story here and it is not clear if the main characters even want to be together (or have the heart to be). But I guess that makes this a fun action flick, and there is a lot of action to be seen here! The story is about a small, but important, planet which was conquered by a greedy and evil Galactic Empire after the destruction of a small rebel force. There is also a villain who seems to have some power in the Empire, but is not as sinister as I expected. So, it is a rather predictable plot and even the plot changes midway through the movie, but it is well-handled and the ending is pretty great, too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a very good film from the french director Gérard Bouchard, the man who made a very similar movie with The Mummy in 1979. We meet a detective detective, whose son gets killed in a plane accident. His wife is trying to make him take care of his little one and he is busy working on a case. The plot is quite similar to The Mummies in that the body is dug out, but there is only a head and a torso left and the body gets covered up by an animal and buried. It is just a sad and pointless film to watch though. It really doesn't do much and doesn't have much to offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm always amazed that a film made by a British director can be so clever and funny - it's like something from a James Bond movie! It's such a great satire on the whole political scene.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a fun little film that doesn't have a whole lot going on. You'll find a variety of locations, and it seems like we'll end up in a movie theater that can't possibly fit anyone in it, so they put the screen in a smaller theater for the film. The lead guy is funny, but the rest of the cast are pretty boring. I mean, they don't even try.   This movie seems to be based around a very old (at the time) book. The character of Richard was based on the author of that book.  The film also features a cameo by a movie actor, although he doesn't do anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a bit of a disappointment compared to the hype (I got my copy around Christmas, it was in a movie theater so it was a Christmas gift). It's not a bad movie by any means, but it's a shame the story, writing and characters weren't given more development.   The story is great, it's funny at times and is interesting.  From a purely plot perspective, the story is about an alcoholic cop who has to go on the run, to try to get money to feed his son. I'll never say this is an enjoyable movie, but I definitely would have enjoyed a little more character development.      After the first hour or so, it felt like I was watching an old western, with a bit more of a plot.  The acting was good, but not great.   The acting is actually good, the characters are well thought out and don't seem to be given much depth. The writing is also pretty good, it doesn't really take itself too seriously, but at the same time, it does take itself seriously enough to avoid being boring.  In a way, it seems to have a lot of character, but unfortunately it doesn�t really develop them very much, only to the extent of the movie, and that's okay because it's actually quite entertaining.     I don't really recommend this one to anyone looking for a good popcorn movie.  2.6 / 5 The Good:  The story is good, and the writing is good.  While it's not as good as the other movies I've seen, this movie still does a pretty good job at trying to get people to buy the DVD, and it would do well as a special feature on some videos.  Also, the special features are not bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the "final" installment of the film series about an ancient race of people called The Chryssalids (or some such nonsense). They live in a planet with two suns, one of them is yellow and the other is blue. The yellow sun shines the light of light upon an earth-like surface, but it is made of rocks, and it has only small patches of grass where there is not water, and small plants that are not as well developed as the grass in the other world. This world is mostly inhabited by a humanoid race, who look like a cross between people and trees, and the sky-blue sun-beams from above light up their world. They worship a creature, the sky god, who is called the Sun God, and he has been around since before mankind existed. The whole time, the creature sits in a cave somewhere in the mountains of this world, with one eye open and the earth beneath him; and he is watching what goes on below. In this world of humanoids, the Chrysalkids, their own race, have a great advantage over their enemy. They have a unique and powerful technology, which they call the Sun-Ray. When it is turned on, the world is bathed in light, and all beings live as if they were under the sky. The people of the Chrysalis race live below the earth in caves, and only some of them are able to leave their cave and go to the surface. The Sun-God is always watching, so he cannot see their world except by the light he shines from above. But it is impossible for the people of Chrysi to move their bodies from the cave. Only the sky light shines upon them, and they live from one day to the next in a state of perpetual rest, without food, drink, or even a change of clothes. The Chysalis do everything they can to stay alive and preserve their way of life, but they have no choice but to depend upon their Sun-Rays.

There is a lot of material that's been done, and I'm not going to pretend that I'm going to be the one to make a movie about all that's happened in this book. If you are interested in history or the Holocaust, don't bother.   There are a few people who are more interested in trying to change the world than learning about their history or dealing with their grief. That's okay, though, because this book does a good job of showing what they did to the victims.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie a couple weeks ago and I had a great time watching it. It was an action packed movie, and did not disappoint. The action in this movie was great. I loved how it had many people being killed by the alien in the opening scene and how he kills them. The alien even takes off his face and flies away as he kills the guy. That was great, and he then flies off. The ending was great too. It brought out emotions in the audience and was not a typical ending. My only problem with this movie is I don't think it got a great review. I don,t think it should have been a film. The story was too predictable. I would watch this movie again to see if it had a better ending. It really could have had a lot of different endings.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story has its own style and characters, but does not take itself too seriously.   The ending leaves a bitter taste in my mouth; it is sad and ironic that a film such as this could have such a devastating effect on a person's life, but it is important to acknowledge that it is not entirely about death, as the audience is given a taste of what could have been. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie stars one of my favorite characters ever:  Peter Quill the star of the Guardians of the Galaxy and his human sidekick a robot named Yondu. Peter Quill is an immortal human who lives on a planet called the planet "Xandar" where he is the only one who survived an apocalypse that destroyed most of humanity. He is in a war against another race of creatures known as the aliens who have invaded his planet and have destroyed his race.   He is aided by his robotic companion Yondra who is really a living time bomb that will go off when the time is right. Peter and Yondrapa also get involved in a love triangle with another couple named Rocket and Groot (the 3D robot from the first two movies) who are the kids of a local king and queen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is a great one. I am not the biggest fan of action films but I was pretty excited about this movie. There is lots of action in the film.   When we first get to the movie, we see that it is a little slow. This is true but I love when it is slow. I like slow movies.  I got to the end of the movie and there was no more action.  That was a nice touch.  There was only two more movies to come.  This is just another movie that shows we should stop the nuclear arms race and the danger they pose.  It does not end the world but it shows us that there is danger out there and we are at war. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun, fast-paced thriller. The story is fairly simple but it's not a bad one. There's not much plot going on here, but it makes for a good watch if you want a nice evening at home and you can make it through the movie with out a headache.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those "what can i say" type movies that i thought was hilarious.   I had heard so many good things about this movie ( i even made a blog about it) but i was just not expecting it to be a big success.  So i was really surprised when my dad was walking in the front of the house while i was watching it.  I thought my friends were in on it too but they just didn't seem like they were.  The movie was very funny and a lot of fun.  When your mother and dad are getting into a fight and she is talking to a friend on her cell phone ( you never see her get off her phone) a man steps out in front of her car and walks away. The guys walk up behind the men and start to ask them what's up. Then the man gets into the car and the two guys follow him.  In the movie, your dad is telling your friends what is going on while your mom is trying to find her way around while talking to the guy.  Then, the guy drives away and the guys catch up with him. They are like "hey, is he really going to a party tonight?" Your mom then calls your mom to find out what's going on.  As you can imagine, she has no idea what is up and she's kind of a dick in this movie.  My dad came in and started trying to put my mom on the phone but she was talking over everyone and not making any sense.  Her response to him: "I don't know what you mean, he was like 20 feet in front.  She didn't say why they were following him. (The man has to tell them that his car was going to be towed and you never hear it mentioned).  So they are like ok that's weird (and they are in on everything).  I think that part of the story is true, as my friends have the same thing happen in their neighborhood and they would always be following behind him. I'm glad that the guys were not there that night (they did go).

There was a lot of suspense in this film: The plot was complex and involved lots of emotions. There were some very good acting performances in this movie. It was quite scary, yet it was very funny at the same time: The movie was quite good. The movie has lots of great suspense and twists. I recommend you to watch this movie:

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say that, yes, I would rather have seen a film that was a bit more original. I would not say that the director did it justice; indeed, I think that the script has a few odd moments (not that the movie is lacking in them), but the acting is strong (if somewhat dated) and the characters are very well developed.   The plot is good and the idea is fine, but it does seem that this was a movie made for a film festival rather than the market. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie starts off very strong. The lead character is a very nice guy who is a bit naive but I think his actions are rather justified. He goes to a school for "geniuses" and seems to make a lot of friends who are mostly there to goof off but he makes friends with a girl in the group who is very attractive but I didn't see any romantic chemistry between them. I think the movie could have been more intense but the first ten minutes are good and if you are interested in movies of the future, this one is a good one to check out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the movie at the Cinema 21. The film opened with a great montage showing people from the old west doing their best to save it from the evils of big business. There was a whole lot of fun action in this film. The lead character was a cowboy who lived in the small town of Cumbria, England. Cumbrians are a tough, hard drinking people who like to drink themselves stupid and have a great time. CUMBRIAN'S STORY It's like a Western I've never seen before... The bad guys seem to be all cowboys. There are scenes where they are drinking whiskey from old fashioned bottles and dancing around with their tights on. One of them goes around in a trench coat, with a big gun strapped on his back. The bad guy is in this trench coat to kill his sister who has killed him.   After the evil woman who killed her brother (who was a Cumbrian) is killed in the fight she goes to visit her sister in the grave. There she meets a very sexy looking young man who has a huge tattoo on his arm. He is trying to kill the evil witch who killed his mother.  The evil witch turns out to be a woman who is really a witch (I think I've seen her before in a movie or book before?). She was married to the evil man who was trying to murder her and he is a wicked looking man with big muscles.    They fight a couple of times and then the evil men try to kidnap the innocent and powerful Cumbian girl who is the sister of the evil bad guy (who is a very beautiful young woman and a CUMBRIA native). The evil woman tries to run away but she is pursued by a bunch of angry cowboys who are all trying to take her away.  A huge fight scene ensues and all these cowboys and cowgirls are really getting into it.  They try to get the cowgirl to marry a rich farmer and so they kidnap her but she has a lot of help from a CUKBRIAN girl who has been waiting for her all her life.  There is a beautiful love scene between them and after that the bad guys all go away (and don't come back). The good guys who are there to protect her run away in a hurry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My new favorite movie is The Exorcist  ! The movie is a good film! The movie was made in 1954. The movie stars Tom Cruise. The film was directed by William Friedkin. The story line was great. I would like to see more movies like this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I have watched this movie quite a few times. It is one of the more fun ones.   It's a buddy movie, which is to say the two friends play around in a park.  One of the guys in their group is an annoying little nerd.  He is the one who keeps talking about computers.  This annoys the other guys so much that one of them makes fun of his big brain and he calls him a nerd. They all play around and goof on each other.  The guy with the big brain is in the lead. He is in charge of their little experiment in the park. The other two are called "mules" who are always trying to show up the guy with big brain.  Their friend, a girl, is trying to make a "cool" new friend for them.  Her friend is the nerd who keeps trying to mess with them, but gets a little excited when his buddy, "The Geek," does some cool experiments.  His buddy is a big nerd and thinks he has a lot of experience with computers. He doesn't really understand the geek's work and is constantly giving the nerd bad ideas.  Eventually, the geek is given the green light to do his experiment.  It is a little scary for them, as the guy is very strong.  When the geek gets the greenlight to go ahead, they start to do experiments with their little friend.  These experiments are scary, even for the nerds.  They try to create strange things out of thin air.  Things they can't even see.  But eventually, they are successful. They make things they can not even imagine.     This movie is funny.  I think it is funny that they don't have any knowledge of computers or science.  Everyone is just making it up as they go along.  We do laugh at the geek.  And we do laugh a lot.  There are plenty of laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would like to give this a 7 out of 10. I would say this is one of the best movie ever made. I was shocked to see it and was wondering why i had waited a week to watch this amazing movie. I did not know there was going to be a sequel until i saw the trailers. I am amazed with the acting and the plot line. I really did not like the other movies and thought it was a let down. This movie was not so much about the good guy and the bad guy but more about the way our characters live their lives.    A little spoiler for the movie: It turns out the evil characters are the children of the father who was in prison. This was really very clever. It is good that the father was not punished. He was a very bad person and wanted to murder his wife so he had the baby. The daughter is named Mimi (the movie) and the brother was named Beni (The movie) They were the main characters and were played by the top of the line kids. The scene in the movie where the two kids kill the parents is really well done.  The movie was made by a very talented filmmaker and has an amazing ending that leaves you wanting to see what happens next.  I have been waiting for this movie to come out and now I have. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I was waiting for the release of this film to come out in Australia (where I've lived for 20 years), I'm an absolute fan of this movie. It's like watching a bad version of a bad comedy show that didn't deserve the praise it got. It had a few laughs in it, but it also had some really stupid moments in it. The story wasn't terrible, the actors were alright and the story was fairly decent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that this movie would be more enjoyable if it didn't have a narrator and more of a story to tell. The movie does have a pretty good story. The main character and his sister were the perfect pair of older siblings. They grew up together and they had an interesting, sweet, and sometimes disturbing relationship. There are some moments where it reminded me of the movie The Parent Trap.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film was made in the early 80's and directed by Bob Clark. The main characters are Bill Lumbergh (a drug addicted ex Army man), his wife Marcy (the pretty, hot, young woman that wants to have sex with Bill) and the two kids that he has with his wife. Marcy is the one that is attracted to Bill and wants to be with him. The problem is Bill is not interested in Marcy but the kids. One day Marcy and Bill decide to get some drugs to use in their sex life. This is going to be a big mistake because drugs do not work for sexual relations with a man. What do you think this movie is about? It is about how people who are attracted to the opposite sex are able to deal with problems and overcome them in a loving and understanding way. They will have a great time, just as you expect a love story to be.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Good Place" is a smart sitcom about the end of the world and the beginning of a new one.  It's an ensemble comedy that feels more like a cross between "30 Rock" and "Community" than a traditional sitcom.  What is a sitcom but a group of people who go through a lot of fun things in a setting where everyone knows everyone else?  A bit like a bunch of frat boys from college going on the big screen.   But "The Good Guy" is an even better sitcom than that.  The people on-screen are all great and the writers play around with the format of the sitcom quite a bit.  (And they're very funny.)  "The Bachelorette" has a lot to recommend it.  There's a very funny cast and a good story line.  But I don't think it could ever be "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" because "The Bachelor" has the better cast.  I would be a little disappointed if I saw a movie adaptation.  A sitcom is a different animal.  Comedy is supposed to be about a funny guy making things up.  Not making up funny people.  Sometimes it's hard to make up funny things.  Maybe if someone with a little more sense than a sitcom writer was writing it, it would be better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was very much a work in progress; there was very little plot and only a small amount of action. The actors and actresses gave wonderful performances as did the directing by Stanley Donen.   In the middle of the movie there is a scene of a couple having a little argument about the subjectivity of memory and the role of emotion in memory, which was very interesting and had a very strong message for those who care about human memory and emotions.  I didn't find it a very interesting film but it was very very good, I'm glad it was made and I'll probably see it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I think it was a good way to wrap up the trilogy of the original Star Trek movies, and it made me feel good watching it, too.   The plot was pretty good, and I really liked how they ended the film. I'm not sure if they wanted it to go on forever, but it did, and that was the best way for it to end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (1) When I first got into this movie I was expecting a good deal of action. I was not disappointed.   When I say action I mean it. I have seen plenty of action movies but none like this.  The action scenes are excellent.  From a firefight at a casino to a shootout in a nightclub, they are done perfectly.  It is well done.  I have never seen a movie where the violence is better than the action scenes.  When a guy is shot in the head it looks like a cannonball, and when an eye is blown out it looks as if someone has poked a mosquito out with a stick.  (2) When the film ended the screen got dark and when the film started up again the screen was bright and the camera was moving.  This could not be a better ending.  After it has ended we are treated to another great action movie.  There were no real surprises in this movie. It was not the typical action movie which can be over done and over acted.  No, this was a good action movie with a good story.  So if you are a fan of action and you like great movies, this is a great movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not a fan of the film, which is unfortunate because I loved the book, and the book was a pretty good adaptation of the movie.   The story is a lot like the movie, it's a thriller, and it really got me excited for the film.  The movie is also very well acted, so if you're a fan, you'll enjoy it, and if you don't enjoy the movie you're just not gonna like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    We live in a wonderful and exciting world that is full of fantastic stories and events. My son was born on 9/27/17. We received a package in the mail on 9-30/17 and we waited till 11-02/17 to take him home from the hospital. This was our first son and we are so excited about him. He is the best thing that has ever happened to us. He came from a very poor family and he has great energy. We love him very much. Our neighbors in the area have seen him and are asking if we have adopted him. My husband and I are extremely grateful for this gift. We are very thankful for all that God has given us and all that He has given to us through the years. We were so blessed and honored to have our son in our lives!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The main character, Raul Dominguez, is a Mexican American ex-convict who is currently living in the outskirts of Boston with his ex-wife and two kids. His story is told in a very engaging and entertaining manner. When I first saw it, I thought it was a retelling of the Mexican-American gangster movie from The Godfather, but it's much more than that. It's a movie about family and a very touching one at that.   It's the first of what I suspect will be many retellings of the story of a gangster's life, in a non-comedy fashion.  It is, however, a well-acted and well-directed movie with a strong cast of characters.  I have no idea if the director would want to do a third film in this type of project, but if this film was given a chance, I am sure it would be just as successful as its predecessors.  I think the cast and the director should be congratulated for their work on this project. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion, the third film of the trilogy is the best of them all. I will admit I have not had a great time watching the first three films. I guess this one is better, however there is a lot of action and explosions in the beginning. The plot is not bad at all, although there are some things that are just not working. It still works, though, and there is not a bad thing about this movie. The story is about two cops, one is a cop and the other is an agent. The cop works in a small city and has a family to support. It is a rough city, and he has to do his job just like any other cop. The film is also about how the lives of the cops affect their families. As a cop, he works a lot with drugs and other criminals, and his wife gets really angry at him because of this. At one point, he sees his wife cheating on him. He confronts his wife and it is revealed that she has been cheating on her husband with a married guy. This story line is interesting, but not really worked out because the film could not handle its own plot well. It just keeps running from one thing to the next, and sometimes the film just is not believable. The first action sequence that is done in this film is excellent. The police shoot at a man who is trying to steal the car of a police officer. This is a very scary sequence because there are a lot more police cars than other films. The guy is a tough guy and they don't really get a chance to see him really fight with them. A lot of people who come to this film will be turned off because of the action scene, but you will see it in a good way. This film is a good, good watch. The action is strong and there are lots of cars in it. I don't like that the film keeps getting in the way of the story.

It was pretty funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny movie with a great sense of humor.   The plot:     When we are a little boy, my father tells us that if you keep the salt from the table, it will stay in your mouth forever.  He says this because he likes to do stupid things to get salt to stay in his mouth and he loves to have fun.  When my father was about 12 years old he bought a horse and rode him a distance.  My father always wanted a horse so he bought another one and rode it.  So the story starts there.  The boy is a boy and goes to the beach for the summer.  As the boy rides the horse around the beach, his father tells him that one day he will be a big boy and ride a horse through the town.  There was a horse there so my father goes around and puts salt on the horses nose.  One day, the horse gets tired and gets down on one knee.  Now, a little older than my father, I remember the horse had a nose like a girl's and my father had a very small nose. I remember my father's nose getting sore every time he tried to have a little fun.      So the boy gets a horse.  Then we get to the part where the horse gives a little bow.  This is when a real boy starts to follow the horse in.  It is a little thing, but there was a boy named John who started following the horse into the ocean.  And when he saw the ocean, the boy ran and jumped on the horse.   There are more boy and horse and many more funny events. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good "first" movie for me. It's a good start to a good series. It may not be all of the characters, but it does introduce a few very important characters who are really good. I like the new villain and I like that they aren't the typical evil evil characters.   I do not like how the film is edited. In fact, I was really surprised at how it is edited for a movie about a crime. I had no idea they cut away from the crime scenes. They also have a lot of scenes of the cops telling each other to be careful and that there are many witnesses to the crime. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a strange film.   When i saw the poster and the film, i had the same idea.  But this movie is different than what i expected.  The acting is amazing.  My favorite character is the young female lead.  She is a really good actress.  This movie is really funny.  It is really strange and really hard to watch.  I found it interesting and interesting and i found it to be a very funny movie.  So if you like weird movies like this one, then this is a movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure if the story of this movie is any good at all, but the film is a pretty enjoyable romp. The movie features a bunch of people that live in a house with a buncha crazy people. There's some fun action scenes and some pretty cool characters. The house in the movie is probably the coolest house ever and there's a pretty interesting relationship between the characters. If I knew what was happening in this movie I would have watched it a lot sooner.

It took a while for the main characters to find a way back from their doom.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed the film, I thought it was great from start to finish! It has a great sense of humour, lots of comedy.   It is about the time when Hitler was in power, which was a lot better then we see now. The Germans in this film are just as bad as we see in our day to day lives, when in this movie we see all the evils that Hitler was capable of, and they even took pictures of him with an 8mm camera.  But this movie really took a while to get going and when it did it was all fun.  The movie had a story line with Hitler and his wife being separated from the Nazi Party, this being the start of a film series that would follow Hitler, with each film taking place during the same year of his life and all his past deeds and what he is now doing to the world.  It's also in some ways an allegory on a world gone mad, it takes a while for the film to go into this, it is definitely worth a watch!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My brother and I loved this movie, we laughed and laughed and cried. I was so impressed by the way the children were put together for the movie, there was really only two kids in the entire movie. We also loved that there was no talking in this movie. They would just tell a story, in great detail. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who loves a good laugh, some great actors, and kids that don't speak!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited about watching this movie, my heart was pounding so fast, I didn't even sleep at all and the excitement in me was out of this world and this movie was so amazing that I cannot put it in words. I had seen The Shawshank Redemption a few years back on my iPad and when it came out I felt so happy and so grateful for it, I remember saying to a friend when the movie started that it was the greatest movie ever made and when I saw this I am going to say that I could not have asked for a better movie.   The movie is about a man who was in prison for a crime he did not commit and when he finds out that he is set free he starts to live his life.  He goes about his day being with his friends, making the most of his freedom.  But, something happens that changes his life forever and he is forced to face the harsh reality of what life was like in prison.  The film is not your typical thriller with lots of bloody mayhem, it is an old fashioned true crime thriller with a lot of heart.  It is not a happy story, it does not have happy endings.  I think the movie made me angry with those who think you can make a good thriller by shooting a gun and beating somebody up, because there was so much blood and gore in this movie. I felt angry and sorry for the people who were in prison, but there was something really special about this movie which is why I could watch it over and over again.  And yes I am a huge Shawshanks fan, I love his movies, I always think of the words "He is no angel" when I hear about the movie, and I think that is a perfect description for the person in the movie: he is no Angel.

Although the story seems a bit repetitive at times it doesn't take long for the character to change and be interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It is a masterpiece of acting." —   In fact, it is more than that, more than "a masterpiece of cinematic genius," more than an "epic adventure of love, lust, and betrayal" — more than a movie like "The Sound of Music" — but the story of it has the same kind of magic and the same quality of the fairy tale. I cannot express just how great this film is — but it is a very good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very simple story, about a poor boy, who, to get some money, sells some milk to an old man on the street. The man gives him a piece of butter which he does not want, so he takes a piece out of a pot, which he has been washing in his kitchen. When he is ready to eat, the old man comes, and has the butter in his hands. He cuts off a small piece of it and places it into the boy's mouth, but the boy is very hungry, and he does eat it. A little while after, the boy wakes up and, although he looks tired, he is very happy. Then the old guy says:  "You have just found a pretty piece of money". He takes off the butter and gives it to the boy to eat. Then he gives him more and more butter until the boy has no more.     "It is quite all right", the old geezer says, "I can't tell you what this means for you, I am too much a man of science, but I do hope it is a good thing". Then he puts the pot in a corner, takes out a piece and gives the boy a little piece of black bread. The boy eats this and then the old fellow says: "You have found your way to a pretty little place, don't you think it's a good idea to go into a little country house and live with a good-looking mother and a nice young father, with their pretty little house and the garden?   The boy takes a long look at the house.

The house was small but well kept, the yard was a lovely one, the kids played in a big dirt yard, and they had a horse and a pony. One day they were having a grand time when suddenly they heard the sound of a cannon. We knew right away they were going to war, but we were not prepared for the horrors we were to witness, as the war that we had not expected, the war between the United States and the German Reich, ended with the surrender of the United Kingdom."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I decided to go out one night and I wanted to see a comedy, so I looked up the title on the internet and thought this was a funny movie. At first I thought it was an old fashioned comedy, but once it began, I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about.  This film is very much like a movie about a woman who has a crush on the manager of a bank who is very shortsighted and lacks compassion. I thought this movie was very funny, and very well made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen it twice and once as an extra.   It is a good science fiction movie that has a few flaws:  It feels a little long at 9 minuets.  A lot of time is spent on character development.  When one of the crew is killed, she is left on a planet.  The aliens are not very sympathetic.  I like the characters though.  What they do is a little odd.  For instance, the robot-girl looks like a pretty attractive girl, but her eyes are filled with hate and rage.  And this is coming from a girl who didn't even watch the movie before reading my review.  Maybe it is not so bad if they are just killing everyone with a metal arm.  That would make for a good sci-fi movie, but not the best.  This movie has many elements that are funny, but some are not funny, and some are just plain bad.  In short, this is a movie that you will have a laugh at a time and a few times a tear.  If you like good science-fiction movies, this might be a good one to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason this movie works is because the first 20 minutes of this movie are great. It's a sci-fi comedy that follows a small group of people living on the frontiers of space and it feels really good to see people doing cool shit like flying around in spaceships, jumping out of airplanes, and playing music on a small spaceship. If you like comedies that are about things that happen in spaces, this movie is a lot of fun.    Unfortunately the movie is just not very funny. The humor is pretty dry and there isn't much in the way of character development or laughs, the characters are pretty much there for the first act and that's pretty much it.  I got this movie because I read that it was one of the best movies ever, the director had a ton of experience in making sci-fic movies, this is a really funny and action packed movie, I wish I knew more about what was going on in the movie, and why it was so popular so I could buy the DVD  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie, the plot is quite interesting.  It tells us about a young man who takes a job working as a night watchman, which is pretty good for a job in the ghetto, and he ends up in a situation with a gang of thieves.   This is a classic noir film, with noir, as in bad, noir as in noir.  The only bad thing about this movie is it was a bit boring at the end of the movie.  However, it still has a good ending and some great stuff throughout the movie to make up for the boring ending.

It is a very well done movie and it brings in the sci-fi genre and even brings in some action scenes.  A very good sequel to a good sci- fi film.  The black hole is a planet with a large hole.  It was not easy to find and when it comes in contact with the sun it becomes black.  And it also causes an energy explosion and a small black hole. This small black holes becomes large ones.  Once it reaches the sun there is nothing that can destroy it.  But one day the solar rays cause some people to be caught and trapped in it. I have read about it before in the science fiction magazines.  As soon as one person is trapped one will be attacked. The main character, a scientist, is a genius.  She is trapped by some of the trapped.  So she goes in search of them.  When she does so she finds a planet.  This planet is populated by many creatures and it has a small sun.  On the sun is a black hole which is very similar to the one that is created by the first black hole in the movie.  While some of them can communicate with one another they have little effect on the black hole that is much bigger.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good futuristic sci- fi movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best movies of the year and the best movie in the year so far.   The plot is interesting and well thought out, but what really makes this movie great is the way the film uses visual storytelling to get the audience involved in the action.  The movie uses many different camera angles to get us into the action, and sometimes you can feel the camera is trying to get you into the story.  It's not a story you want to skip, but you will want to keep going through each sequence of events, and the story never gets too convoluted or too slow.  I thought the performances were well done all the way through, and even though I don't think most actors will make a living out of acting, they sure are good enough to make this movie.  But don't get too carried away, because this movie does have one of those twists ending at the end that makes the whole movie worthwhile.

I've only seen a few films about the first astronauts and this one is an interesting mix of real footage, and animation.   While it isn't groundbreaking it is a fun and well made film that's worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't really know why, but this movie really does feel like a throwback to a time when a movie was only about a boy and a girl who knew how to live for each other, and a boy in love with a girl.    It is that sweet and innocent feeling that makes this movie very nostalgic and also a great movie to have as a Valentine's day treat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was an okay movie, not amazing. But a good one. The story is good, but that is just about all. You have a good story about a girl named Lucy who lives on a farm. In a way, she seems like a typical rural farm girl until she meets a handsome stranger named Jim. As they start to fall in love, Lucy begins to experience a strange and very scary form of epilepsy. As time goes on, she develops other problems, such as a strange obsession with a dead man (the "White Ghost") and a strange curse on the farmer's daughter. They all meet again when a series of violent deaths occur in the small town of Waco. The girls realize that a terrible killer has been living in the town and that the town is now being overrun by killer rats that kill, eat, and sleep. The two heroes, Lucy and Jim, now have to save Waco from extinction.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie twice at the local theatre (they showed it for only $8.00 each) the first time, and while I found the movie a bit slow and not all that compelling, I did enjoy the movie enough. The sequel, however, is a completely different movie. It had many more laughs and less blood (not really a fan of that), and the ending left me wishing I had the film's director to ask what happened to him (not that the movie is bad by any means).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen a movie like this since the early 80's, and there's not even a hint of the 80's in it.   There's no talking heads.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was watching this movie because it was the first movie of the series I've ever seen.   A lot of the plot I was a little lost on initially.  I'm not gonna go into too much detail about the movie, but I'll say that the movie is about a group of people that are trying to steal a car.  These people are all really bad looking people, and they are trying their best to do it.  While they're trying, they get caught and then a bad guy and an innocent get killed.  The movie moves along and gets more interesting as the characters keep being killed, and this only gets more intense.  All the characters are very stupid, and I think that is what is the point of the movie.  It's really stupid and yet very enjoyable.  This movie is not worth the time that I have to waste on it. I could watch the first one in its entirety before I would have even begun to enjoy this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What makes it a good action movie is that the action sequences were well written, well filmed and very well choreographed.   There were many spectacular scenes in this movie and they were very well done.  The fight scenes were very good, very impressive and well-done.  In a way the action is not real but it is very well made, well choreoised, well paced and well directed.  This movie would be a good addition to any action movie collection, it had so many great sequences and fight scenes and is very fun to watch.  You may not have heard of it but The Expendables 2 is an action movie that not only entertains you but also makes you laugh.  It does this by adding a lot of humor, including some jokes about "the little men" and "the big men" as well as some great action sequences.  And there are even more jokes and characters in this sequel than the first movie.  To get an idea of what this movie is about, just watch this clip:  I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the original one.  A little longer, a little better directed and a little more well made.  Overall, this movie did a lot better job of entertaining than the previous one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know you've got the makings of a great story when a woman's life changes completely and she finds herself going to the very same house where she once lived with her parents. That's what happens when the woman goes to live with her grandparents in a house that's just across the way. She soon discovers the house has a story of its own. As this story evolves and the action gets more and more intense it really is a treat to see a woman fight back and take control of her own life.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie I watched in the trilogy was the one about the war between the Nazis and the allies. I thought it was very good, but nothing like the first part, where it was about the liberation of France. This is about the Battle of France and I think it is an excellent movie. It was a war between two major groups of the Allies, the French and British and this is what I love the most. It is good and it is fast-paced and exciting, I can't really explain how it feels because I have only seen it a few times. It's a lot of fun, I love it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie about a bad guy with no good guys.   The title of the movie is just a little bit annoying but it doesn't take away from the movie.  A story about a kid and a bad dude on the run.  The film itself was enjoyable, I like how the bad guy is different from the other bad guys in the movie and he has some good qualities too.  You can't really do any bad deeds here but you can do some good deeds.  For me the ending was a little cheesy but i guess that's to be expected with a movie this good.  I highly recommend this movie, even if you don't like bad guys it will still entertain you.

I do think it has some good parts. The actors and the actors who played the part of the old cartoons were well done. But the worst thing about this film is that the director was drunk when he started to make this film. He does a bad job.

The cast is pretty much exactly like what I expect of a TV movie. I guess they could have put a better story on here (I'm looking at you, 'The Next Generation'), but it was all done in a cool, modern-looking way. I enjoyed myself a lot. I do miss that old school '80s cheesy-ass action movies, but then they have their own movie-sucking, lame-ass versions of all the most iconic ones.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot revolves around a group of boys in the middle school. One day, they discover a magic book, with a boy named Odaemon, a vampire. Odaemons is the protagonist. They try to help him, and discover a secret to how vampires like blood. This movie is all about the vampire's love for his human form. His only wish is to be with his little sister. So, they fight each other over his love. This is an epic movie about a boy and a vampire, who can't seem to get rid of each other. And the ending is all the more emotional because of the relationship that they build. This film isn't really for kids, because it takes itself seriously. Also, the acting is average, though it does improve.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     " I watched this movie on a Friday night around 8pm. It was my first time watching a movie in a theatre. The movie starts off by having an opening scene which made me happy. A girl gets killed by some robbers and a young man gets dragged in her place and is shown the same way he got dragged in the first place.  The movie then jumps ahead a little. This is the first time we see the killer's face and when he opens the box and looks into it the girl's face is revealed to be beautiful.  He looks away to a girl in a bikini who has a really hot body. She takes off her top and starts masturbating.   "He puts a little bandaid over the girl and then pulls a gun out and shoots it through the side of her head. "   I laughed so hard I cried at the end. It didn't do much to make me laugh but I was crying at the same time.  I'm so glad I gave this movie a chance.  "

There are so many things in this movie to be impressed by, and it is all well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's hard to believe that in the 1950s, Hollywood had such a clear vision of what movies could be.   The movie I'm reviewing is called "The Black and White Man."   I saw it about 10 years ago when I was in college.  In the 1950's black and white was still popular and was seen in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."  It was about a family that would grow a black and a white child.  When I saw the movie I was shocked by how realistic the movie was.  The black and the white child is a very realistic black kid and the black kid has a very serious attitude about being black.  He is very mean to the white kid and is very rude.  I didn't think black kids were mean but I didn 't think they were as rude as the black guy.  It wasn't just a black kid either, there were other black kids in the movie.  This movie was made in the mid 60's, when the first black guy was being cast in a film.  So it's not only a black guy, it's also a white guy. This movie is about a little boy who is growing up.  After he grows up and moves to a neighborhood with a white family he meets a black boy, the black boy will have to deal with a little black boy who has grown up and is rude to him and everyone he meets.  His mother has died but the black man is living with her so he does live with her, that's how I believe that the black and black kid would have to grow up.      What makes this movie very good is the way it captures the racism and violence of the 1950 era.  There were lots of racist movies in the 50s that were not good but this one was good.  A lot of movies about the 50's were made before the civil rights movement and so there were some movies that were okay, this was not one of those good movies.  For the most part it's just bad bad bad.  Some movies are very bad but this movie is a good example of why bad movies have to exist.  To be honest, I think "The black and White man" was a bad idea.  But, in the 1960s, movies just had to exist, so it was something that was made.  You can find a lot of good movies made in that decade but
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie about 7 months ago. It was great! I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie and laughed hysterically, it's very funny. I was a little disappointed to find out the film was made during the Cold War but it's still entertaining and it's the most realistic depiction I've ever seen of a small town with a local army base and a couple of military officers who make it a little more realistic. A great movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was so excited to see this movie. I love movies like this. I was pretty disappointed to find that it is a rehashing of the previous film. I have to say, I am not really into movies that feature bad people but if the people in this movie really have that much evil in them that they should be imprisoned, what else do you need? I guess, maybe they all had to get in the wrong places and the wrong cars and whatnot but this was just so much bad in this film. The ending is kinda lame and I think we should have been told that. There were other problems like, one of the guys was supposed to be a scientist in this one but that just made me wonder if they were really using real scientists like they used to in the old days and this was why they didn't use real scientists to make things. And then there was the whole thing with a guy driving a giant car. Really? He got to drive a huge monster truck? I mean come on. We all knew how stupid that would have been and it really was a terrible ending. But then there were other things that just bugged me as well. I think the ending was kind of a lame and bad idea. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is set in the small town of the same name in the United States and is a bit like the movie 'A Christmas Story.' It's about a father and his daughter who are both really bad parents, and their daughter is very annoying. The dad is constantly going on and on about how good her friend is (not really) and how much he wants to get to know her better but her mother is very strict and doesn't let him have anything to do with her anymore. It all starts out with a guy, named George, who comes home late one night to his apartment. He is in his pyjamas and his face looks all pale and hollow. He then finds a bottle of sleeping pills in the kitchen and a note from his daughter, which explains that George was late for work and she would rather wait until he comes back to give her a better present. The girl wants to go home and get to bed, but her father has other plans. He makes her get dressed up in the girls' clothes and then gets out of bed. He goes to his daughter's bedroom and she wakes up very quietly. The camera moves in and out in close up, moving from her nakedness to her mother's reaction to this strange sight. The scene lasts a couple of seconds, but it seems like a long time to anyone who didn't see it. George is angry and he doesn't like what his daughter is doing with her body. George tells his daughter that she needs to get in bed and stay there until she gets a good night's sleep. But her mom doesn't understand how this is a good idea and wants to make sure her daughter doesn't sleep with him. George starts to leave and starts to cry because he's upset about all of this. The mother and daughter exchange some more angry words and George grabs his daughter by her shirt and drags her back to bed. George then proceeds to force himself on the girl. The daughter doesn`t really seem to mind as she just sleeps.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My parents bought this movie for me. So I had to see it when I was about 9 years old. It was a kid's movie for kids that have the brain of a 7-year-old. It is a really silly movie that has a lot of heart. It's not for kids but it's just fun. It has a few songs that kids can sing along to and it's all for fun. I don't understand all the songs that have come from it because I don 't know any other words. So it was pretty cool. I have yet to see the sequel which is about a child who has a brain the size of a walnut and is called "Brain-in-a-box" by everyone he meets. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie!   I'm not sure what I expected.   The movie starts out with a pretty decent ending, and then it gets really awesome.  There is a very well made horror movie about a little girl who sees a dead little girl.  The girl she sees, as her name implies is dead.  But she doesn't really remember her.  And she has been possessed.  In the middle of the night, she wakes up.  What happens?  Well she finds out that she's actually alive, but it turns out she's in a house she has never been in before.  She has a room with a window looking out, and she keeps hearing footsteps moving all over.  It's not very much that she can control where the footsteps are going.  A house full of people, children, the house itself, and her mother, she doesn´t feel at all alone.  So she has a few choices.  1. Go to her mother. 2. Find a way to get to the outside. 3. She must get out.  You see, it's not as easy as it looks.  When she sees a man standing there, her mother doesn't want to believe her, and so she runs away.  If she doesn�t, her mom will be found and killed, and the little girl will die too.  I don't want a scare movie that is scary all the time.  Sometimes, it might seem that way, but I didn't feel that way at all.  It was pretty much a mystery in itself.  After a while, I actually kind of liked this movie.  Now that I have seen it, I don�t know if I want to see it again.  Maybe, but not until I can go back and see it in HD.  For now, I give it a 6/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a very strong critic of Hollywood movies, and have had a lot of problems with them and most of the TV shows in the past, but that did not prevent me from watching this movie. I liked the director's humor and I thought it was done really well. I thought the acting was good and that it was a good combination of funny and action. I do not think the actors got their jobs done, but I am sure they are happy with what they got. I also liked the movie a lot for the way the story was put together. It is a very good mystery film, and the mystery was done in a way that the audience could relate to. I give it a four out of five stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When a movie starts off with a pretty girl walking through the forest, a little boy asks for a snack from her. "I've got a banana, I think". After a couple minutes, a huge green tree appears out of the forest. It is filled with spiders. The girl asks the little boy to follow her up the tree and finds a big spider sitting on top of a spider. She then asks if he wants to eat the spider. The little boy decides to follow after the spider and eats it. After that, he finds the big spider on the ground and eats him. The spider goes on a rampage and starts eating the little girl's clothes, clothes for her and even her shoes. In the movie, this is not a bad movie. It has the right blend of horror, comedy and adventure. The movie is about a girl that has just turned 17 and has no money. She wants to live off of a small plot of land in the woods, but because of her father's health, she's having to spend most of her days up there by herself. There are no roads leading up to the forest and no way to get to it. One day, she meets a strange little boy, who tells her of a magical tree that can grant wishes to whoever sits under it, and he also talks about an "angel of death" that lives under a tree at night. When the girl looks into the tree, she sees a big man-like spider and decides that she wants to try to eat it. As it turns out, the big guy is the one who wishes she did that. After getting chased out of there by the little guy's father, the little witch tries to kill the little spider, but she doesn't succeed. After the big man is eaten, the witch tells the little man that he'll never see his mother again, but that it's okay because he's going to die anyway.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a story that is told by a man who had a vision to save the world and also make his living from it. And this is his story, told by an old man with a long nose, his beard and the most amazing voice.   The movie is about a man named Peter who travels to an island to find the next great prophet named Joseph, but what happens on the way is that the men who have been there before are attacked and killed by a mysterious man named Dagon.  After the fight, Peter is in a trance and thinks to himself, "Why do I look the way I look?" And then, the next day, Peter wakes up and is confused by what happened.  This was a very interesting film, not to mention, very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason I started watching this movie was because I wanted to get into a good romance/fantasy movie, and in this movie, I couldn't be more disappointed.   They give us the feeling that this is a romantic comedy movie, but I have to say that this movie is more of a comedy, and a bad one at that.  From the beginning, I had a hard time watching the movie, even though it started off with a great romance and then proceeded to be a bad movie.  The bad part about this movie? It's just plain cheesy.  I feel that it's a shame that someone would like to do a romantic movie with a bad ending because it makes it look like a bad romcom.  It's a romcom?   I'm sorry, I don't know how anyone can like a romance/comedy that has bad acting, bad acting with bad characters, and worst of all, no good music.  That's all I have for this movie. This movie just has to be watched to be convinced you are not seeing a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like a good romantic comedy you need to see "The Girlfriend Experience".     This is a story of two beautiful girls who meet and fall in love.   A very clever romantic comedy about two very beautiful girls.  The comedy is very funny and the sex scenes are just like it should be.  I was very entertained and enjoyed the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time.   This movie is an absolute masterpiece of horror and it has the right tone for a horror film.  The story is good.  I liked how the movie was done.  There is a lot of blood and gore but the movie does not go overboard on gore.  This is a good horror film with a good story.  Don't miss this movie if you have seen it.

A great film that can be enjoyed by any audience.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on tv recently. I thought it was okay, not bad or anything like that, but it seemed to have been made to be watched when one had a cold, or at least to pass time.   The movie was about a girl called Margo. She is a prostitute, in a town called "Hook". Her mother died a year before she was born. The town is poor, the men are mean, and there is the same old bad- luck, but there is a girl named Margo that takes care of the girls who stay there. When a boy in the town, Tommy, is about to get married, Margo gets him to come to her place, to tell her that he is going to marry a girl from Hook. At first she is upset about it, but then she thinks of a plan. Tommy tells Margo to put a piece of the old woman's head in the jar on the shelf, and when he gets there, Marge will go out and find the rest of the head. Margo waits until Tommy has got through telling her of the good-luck of her and then she gets him a gun, and tells him to go and find a woman called "Nan" and get her to put her head into the jar, with the piece of a head in it. They go and search all the town to find the woman. Marge is out on the porch when she sees the old one. It seems that Nan had been in the house for a year, and had not been given a piece to put in the cupboard. Marnie thinks that she is Nan, so she tries to find Nan, but she is nowhere to be found. Mandy goes out to look, but doesn't find Nan either. Mare tries to do some searching, but the old lady keeps running out from the house. Mervy, Marny and Marge, and Tommy all search all night and all morning, but to no avail. Marelle asks Margo where Nan is, and Margo tells her that she has not seen her. Merenelle asks about Nan, and then it is Mare who thinks that Nan has been found. She goes to Nan's house and there, she sees Nan. Marna, she asks what is the matter, but Nan says that Marnelle is just going to give the old cupboard to Nan, to use for a while. Mern

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never did like the movie.   The movie starts off with a couple having an argument. This is where I got the impression that this was just a couple friends in a bar arguing.  But then in comes a mysterious guy and this guy is totally uncool. He starts drinking all the time.  When the movie started, I was thinking that it was just gonna be a couple of drunk guys having some drinks. I was very wrong.  Then the movie turned into a dark mystery thriller about a guy named Mike who kills people for no reason.  I thought this movie was just going to be a dark thriller about what the movie is about.  It turned into just about the only good movie this week.  And I got a good laugh out of it.  If you like movies with a good story line and are not afraid to laugh, I would recommend this to you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If the title "Black or White" isn't already pretty obvious: "Black" is a film that isn't afraid to be funny. There's a lot of things you can't laugh at in this film. The film is a satire on society, how racism is handled by the police and the people in the film. While you can take a few things that don't work too well or feel like they are in bad taste it is still a pretty funny and thought provoking film.

It features the most diverse cast in film history, including a little kid, a blind man, a handicapped man and a man in a wheelchair, a lot of jokes, a very touching story and a very good ending. I think the writer had a lot more ideas than just about any other writer of this period and while this is the first he is not the only writer who can write in the first person, he is still a very talented writer who is going to be a big talent in the years to come. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing I liked about the movie was that it was just like a typical movie and not a special one. Not really special in that you know what you're going to get with a movie but it is a movie you can watch just like any other movie.   One thing I do not like about this movie is that the first 20 minutes were just boring. But by the time the movie reached the part where the hero is fighting a big snake the movie went downhill from here on out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good, but nothing much is going to change the future of the movie. That's it. I like the character of David. I didn't really get to know him that well, but he's a pretty cool guy. I think he would make a pretty great cop. I liked the dialogue between them. I thought it was pretty well written. I don't think it did much for my interest in the future. It seemed a little too obvious what the point was. It was a pretty good movie. It felt a little slow, but then again, I was expecting a good action movie. I guess that's one of the reasons why I like to watch science fiction films.

It deals with the themes of self-discovery and the beauty of the human form, with a lovely soundtrack that really gives the film a sense of beauty. The story is based on a novel of the same name, by Lillian Smith (who is a brilliant writer, but I think her story is less interesting than the movie).

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is set on a planet called Mars, a planet known for its harsh environment. The film begins with a meteor striking the planet, destroying the Martian civilization. The next day the leader of the Martian society, a scientist named TARS, is seen on a monitor saying, "Today it is a day of mourning. Today the end has come." The only survivor is a woman named MIR. Her life is one that seems to have come to an end. This is the story of an astronaut stranded on Mars. Her only desire is to find the man who will take her to Earth. The astronaut must find a way to get to Earth without being detected by a group of "aliens." She will do whatever it takes to accomplish this goal. The way I saw it:  This film was definitely not to be taken seriously. It had a lot of humor, a good story, some nice special effects and some decent acting. The movie was entertaining, but not very intelligent. I didn't feel like I was watching a good science fiction film. I felt like I had been tricked into watching a bad movie.

There are some scenes in this movie that are hard to watch for those who are not too familiar with horror movies.  The movie will have you in tears and at the same time it's funny.  After the movie was over I was in a state of shock and the tears kept running down my face.  It is definitely a good thing to watch, and is worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new release of the classic  The Exorcist  isn't just a new release: this is one of the best movies of the 90's.   It starts out with a nice sequence of a ghostly figure stalking a child (a boy) from the window.  After a few minutes it disappears into a dark room and I was immediately afraid.  A black mist surrounded me, which I thought was a real demon until I saw a light.  Then a beautiful girl who appeared to be a nun appeared before me.  She was dressed in white and was holding a bouquet of flowers in her hand.  The nun gave a very touching speech about how she was a priest in training when a demon attacked her, causing her to lose her faith and faith in the Devil.  While the nun was speaking to me, the black mist left the house and appeared at the window again.  This time a man with a large gun appeared in the doorway and told the nun that he would kill her if she didn't tell him what she saw in the house.  I was terrified and the only words out of the nun were 'Do not kill me.'   He pulled a gun out of his coat pocket and fired a shot into the air.  Just then the nun said "I know how you feel".   "I am so glad you have forgiven me".  Then the black cloud appeared again and began to move and then a large wooden door appeared above the door.  When I looked out into the room, I saw the man and the nun lying on the floor, with the demon on top of them.  It was then that the priest who had come to rescue her appeared.  He said he wanted to give her a little gift.  "This is for the dead, a crucifix of the Holy Family."   I never got the crucifix, but the nun did.  Finally the priest gave the demon a kiss and the demon disappeared.  With that scene, the movie ended.  There is something about a movie like this, that makes you feel so good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just came across this movie about a man who loses his wife (not a big fan of a widow in a story set in a town called "St. Louis"). As time goes on, he finds himself drawn back to his beloved wife and to their farm. He begins to wonder if he has forgotten her. What if they had never met? The movie, in fact, is full of things that will keep you thinking. For example, a woman is on a fishing trip (an idyll) and at the end of the trip, she stops to help a truck driver with his truck. She has a great memory of the truck driver and she starts to remember everything about him. What a great surprise to find that they were married at the beginning of the movie and that he had had a great wife! So the story unfolds, but the movie keeps on reminding you that they are married and the truck drivers wife is a widow.   A good picture that keeps on being enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best action films of the year and the best Star Trek movie to date, even if the second half is a little weaker.   It is the first Star Trek sequel that I have seen in a while, and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film is rather interesting and very original, and also very funny. It is not just a generic space opera, but an interesting adventure movie with some action sequences as well as humor. The characters are quite different, but the dialogue is great and the humor is funny.  The movie is very action-packed, so the movie is good in that regard.  I must say that the story was slightly rushed by some of the CGI. The CGI in this film is pretty good, but it would have been much better if they had just left the CGI alone, instead of making everything look fake.  Another thing is that the opening and the ending are rather repetitive, but this movie does not need a lot of repetition, since most of the action is very good.  Overall, this is a great movie, and the first time I watched it was a real treat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " The film, in essence, presents a fascinating example of how we perceive our world through the eyes of a person with Alzheimer's disease, or what is sometimes called "dementia praecox". " It has many qualities, one of them is the fact that the film is shot entirely in black and white, that it is very slow paced, and that it takes its time to explore the most mundane of things. The film takes its main character, Ed (Tom Hulce) and his brother Frank (Loretta M.S. Taylor) to a small town called White Sulphur Springs, Tennessee, to investigate the disappearance of a young man named Danny (John D. Dix), a young boy whose home has been burned down. At the beginning of the film, we are presented with the town of White Sulphiure Springs, and then, Ed and Frank head off to investigate Danny's disappearance and find out the nature of the fire that engulfed his home, and what caused the fire, and, from the small towns that Ed and a small team of firefighters travel through, we learn that this place, this community, is very much alive, and is something of a melting pot of people, many of them in their 20s and 30s, all of them coming together to experience life in small towns like White Sulpheur Springs. It is a very interesting and well-made film that tells us a lot about how, sometimes, life can be pretty dull, or even very dull at times, but, if there is a bright spot in the otherwise dark lives of Ed and his friends, it is the people who surround them.   Tom Huddleston as Danny The family of Danny, John Dix (L) and Loretta Taylor (R). This film was shot on location in White Sulphaure Springs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love horror movies.   My favorite are probably the horror films in the "A" section of The Criterion Collection.  They are the perfect blend of suspense, blood, and creepy humor.  This is a perfect blend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best thing that happened to me on this film was watching a few kids in their cars and watching as the parents get out and yell at them.   Well, the kid who was driving his bike was not impressed, so he got back on his bike and rode off.  The scene in which the cop is standing on a bridge trying to decide what to do is the best thing about this movie.  This movie is more about people than cars.

In my opinion, this was a fun and unique movie for a young audience, but that also meant that it was a little disappointing for those of us who have seen a lot more comedies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the world needs a new hero, the movie gets it right.   This movie will change your life, because it is about a boy who gets sent to a dark place by an angel who wants to rescue him from a dangerous city.  When we first see this boy he is running through a field, looking for his mom. After a while, he meets a little boy who looks very similar to him, so we have to guess who the little boy is. The angel sends him to this city that looks like the streets of New York, which has some similarities with the streets in New York.  But we have another difference.  Here, the angel is an evil angel who seems to be in a feud with the devil.  It is hard to tell how serious this rivalry is, but it makes things very interesting.  The city is a place where people are always talking about their plans to get rich, so the boy soon gets to know the city and its dark side.  We see some people who look like they are trying to kill the boy.  Then he meets another boy who seems very dangerous, so he goes back home, not knowing what to do next.  I'm not going to tell you what happens, but this movie is a little disturbing.  This is a good, sad movie that will make you think about your life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is about a little girl named Sarah who lives in a small house with her parents. She has a very loving and caring father who takes her around the country to see relatives and to see different types of people. Sarah's uncle is the one that tries to fix up the house, which has become in such a terrible state. Her father has been working all his life so he has not earned enough money to fix the house. The house was left in such condition that Sarah was afraid to even take a shower and there was a hole in the ceiling. At one point Sarah asks her uncle what is wrong with the house and he replies that the house has been put up for sale and he has been out of work for some time. The uncle then gets a job as a dishwasher at the old house and his first order of business is to find a new place for Sarah. Soon he manages to find her a house in a quiet suburb. He is so happy that Sarah finally lives at peace with herself and the rest of the world.       I found Sarah to be a very relatable young girl and an honest portrayal of an unhappy marriage and family. The husband is a bully and does all he can to make his wife stay at home with the children. The wife is quite often quite rude and condescending to Sarah but I found her character to be quite relatable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first two thirds of this movie, which I thought were okay, were actually quite enjoyable. By the time the end comes around, however, the movie is a complete dumpster fire.   Well, there are two reasons I thought this was a bad movie: 1) The lead, a girl called Svetlana (played by Natalya Tikhonova), has no idea what she's doing; 2) The character of a former American general, who had a rather interesting (if over-the-top) role as a Soviet-American spy in the movie, is completely destroyed by his own actions, which is extremely stupid.  When Svetliya, a beautiful Russian girl (Natalya is an excellent Russian actress), leaves her fiance, who is working for a rich Russian aristocrat, to marry another man and move to Moscow. To make the best of things, she enlists the help of a Russian man called Sergei. While they are making love in a Russian mansion, Sergei has a vision of the future: the US will win the Cold War and invade Russia. Sergei gets on the train to meet his wife and brother (who are both in Moscow), but just before he leaves, he has an encounter with a former colleague of his called Vyacheslav Molotov. Molotv, now a colonel in the Russian Army, has had a very strange and very violent encounter with the US General, in which he is shot in the chest by a sniper (who was a US-American). The General sees Sergei, is horrified at what has happened and rushes to save him. The Russians manage to get the General to safety and return home. But the US soldiers, having not found Sergei, still believe that the Russians are responsible and start to hunt down the Russians. At the beginning of the film, Sergei tells Svetlia that he is going to work with a "group" of men who will destroy the US "power". He tells her that this group is called "Svoboda", which means "Red Star". At the end of the movie however, there is no such group. It seems that after a few more seconds of dialogue in the first scene of the second part, I was going to have my head bashed against a wall. After a while, I thought that they should have been better prepared for this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit: I am not much of a fan of horror movies. I always have found them either too simple and lacking a little something in their gore or too convoluted for my taste. I don't know what it is about all of the horror films that just make me roll my eyes and want to scream. But this one managed to get my attention.   It started off very quickly and was not really scary. As I started to become more familiar with the characters and what they were up to I could start to see why the film is so good.  To me it was like watching an old classic horror flick. The performances are all so believable and they are all done with such style that you can just imagine that it was filmed in the early seventies.  It starts off with a beautiful scene of the two lead actors playing together, a beautiful young girl and a dark-haired young man, then it becomes a bit more of a mystery as a police detective finds a note in a trash can and he seems to know that the person who wrote it was involved in some sort of gruesome murders. The notes start to add up as the detective is unable to figure out what the person wrote and as the girl starts to disappear and reappear. There is a lot of mystery and suspense in this movie but the performances by the two leads are so well done that it does not take away from the story.  The director really gets to show off his acting chops and as a result the entire movie is really chilling.  My one complaint about this movie is the ending. It felt a bit forced but I can see how a lot would like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason why I enjoyed this movie is because we have a good old fashioned Western set in a post-apocalyptic world. The story is quite enjoyable and this movie has a good pace as we follow two brothers as they have to find a place to live. The storyline is well written and it keeps the audience's interest and doesn't rush them. This movie makes for a good experience with a good soundtrack and interesting characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't believe I just spent $15 to watch "Barry Lyndon" (the new one)   There are so many excellent movies on the big screen these days, so why don't we get something that is good and old, at least in my opinion, this is a great movie that I would recommend for all the people that haven't seen "Benny Hill" or "Pancho Villa".   It's hard to review a movie when it's so close to the actual events, I really hope there is a sequel and the story continues the same way it did.   If there is no sequel, I'm afraid I will have to say I have never seen a more interesting movie than this one and will be watching it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was totally surprised by this movie. I would have thought I saw that before, but this is a lot more intense than it should be. I also like the characters in this movie, except for the guy who is a total douche.   I watched this movie a while back, but I've finally got a DVD of it.  The movie has a lot of scenes like this and it was a lot scarier than I was expecting, but it was still quite funny, and very fun. I think it's an original story about a little girl who wants to get revenge on the little man who messed with her sister and her family. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie after having watched 'The Dark Knight'. While 'Dark Knight' was good, 'The Crow' was a little better.   First of all, the movie was good.  The story was good and the movie had an interesting premise, but the plot really lost steam when it wasn't the action.  First it was about a witch who wanted to kill a king, but then the king wanted her to join him.  Then she gets an evil spell that makes her want to kill and eat people.  Now the movie got really good in the last half of the movie.  What I liked about the movie, was that the witch didn't want to be the person that killed people and wanted the person who was being fed to be her friend. The story then ends with the hero trying to find the witch's daughter, who is on a mission to kill the king.  After she killed the king, she killed some of his bodyguards, which brought him to the conclusion that he was the bad guy and her father was the king's best friend.  She then was on a quest to kill him by trying to kill his bodyguard, but it wasn�t a simple task for her because the guy had a sword that she didn't like.  I think the movie would have benefited from a little more character development.  Also, she really needs to get some lines in the movie as her lines are a little too long and sometimes just plain don't add anything to the story.  Overall, I liked the movie and I'm glad I watched it.  It's a good horror movie, but I don't think it's a very good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at a great concert last night and there was a great movie playing in the background, about a high school basketball team called "The Lumberjacks" who are all pretty well dressed.   The basketball coach has his best pal who is the best player on the team.  This is about his life leading up to the game, he and his friends have to face up to each other, but the coach has the perfect plan.  My son is a HUGE fan of this movie, he went to a highschool in New England. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie of the year.   It is soooooo weird and awesome and awesome.  It's sooooooo fun.  You are a little boy living in a strange world, when all of a sudden the power of an evil clown is released on the kids of his town and they all go to the circus.  The clown is in a fight with a man dressed as a donkey and when he's about to win, the donkey takes a bite out of his face.  At this point, the boy can do nothing and just sits in his house and waits for the clown to show up.  He is told later that the clown comes down and is angry that the boy had gone out of the way to take care of the donkey and did not listen to him.  And that was where I lost the plot.  After that, it was mostly like a crazy clown movie.  In all, it's just a good time.  This movie really makes you smile.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie to watch during a summer day: it is not a fast film. it is a beautiful one, a dreamy one, and a beautiful film to watch: a film with the atmosphere of a fairy-tale, with a small but wonderful cast of characters, with beautiful music, with interesting plots, and with a wonderful ending.   There are very few films that can rival this for a summer-day atmosphere: it has everything: the setting: a small German village (it is an old castle), the village: small German people living and looking at a beautiful castle, the young prince, the beautiful young girl, the prince, and the old woman who cares for him, the great big bird of which a part of the film is made up of, the "bizarre" birds, the little children playing, the birds of which we are told things that cannot be repeated. The ending is a good one, too.  The first ten minutes are very interesting: a young boy and a prince come from the castle and look at the forest, look at a bird who goes away to a village somewhere in Germany, and at a large bird called the "little king" and some small birds, birds that never existed (in fact, they were never heard of until now), then look at an old woman and a little bird and, finally, look around and look for a good place to sleep.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great, for a lot of reasons.  The characters are amazing, the action scenes are awesome, and the plot twists are very entertaining.   Unfortunately, the movie itself is a little over-long, and suffers from some serious pacing issues.  The movie has a lot going on, and most of it doesn't really matter.  There's a lot to get through, and some of it does get a little repetitive.  A lot of the movies problems can be attributed to pacing problems; there's a ton of action scenes that last a very, very long time.  It's also hard to keep track of all of the characters, and at a certain point they all begin to blur together.  If you really want to see a very good superhero movie, this is a good one to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     In general I found the first part of this movie to be a bit more entertaining than the last two, with the movie starting with a good plot and moving on to some solid comedy (I'd give it 5 stars overall if the movie was longer).   It is a nice mix of classic and newer genre, with lots of action and comedy.   The characters are a nice mixture of likable and despicable, but their relationship is also a good part of the movie.  The movie never really delves too deeply into the psychological aspects of the human character, but it does a good job of making the audience look at the characters from different angles.  While the action is good in general, I didn't find the ending to be very satisfying.  But I guess that's probably because I have not seen the last 2 parts (it is probably in the DVD-Box), but the plot is solid overall and I'd definitely recommend this movie for everyone who loves a good action movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of the movie and the book then this is a must watch. This is a fantastic film and book series that has been a joy to read. My only criticism is that it's hard to follow the story from one point to the other, though this isn't a bad thing. It does get in the way of things happening at times though which is not too bad because in the end things do settle down nicely and we are treated to a great film and great book series.

He was great in every way, his character, his motivation and all around his character was great.  When you think about it, the idea is great. It makes the audience be interested in the movie.  They don't know that this is a real person, a human. They don,t know that they are being watched.  It is just a great character! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is the best animated film I have seen so far this year. The music is a wonderful score by Alan Menken and lyrics by Bob Schott, and I can see the magic of what Bob Schoeltz and Alan Menkens have created here. It is a wonderfully simple story about a boy named Tom and the giant, who loves a little girl named Mater. They go to the beach and Tom and Mater play on the beach. Tom gets into a tiff with the giant who is a little mad and tries to break up their play. Tom is frightened and he runs away. Mater is the last to find him, and she sees a little pink flower coming out of a bush. She says that her father gave it to her, and Tom thinks it's Mater's. So they play together again, but Mater has grown tired of Tom and she leaves. When she gets home, she tries to get rid of it, but when she gets to the giant's house, she finds the flower is there. She tells him that she has found Mater, but he says he does not want anything to do with her and that it's a bad thing that she can't get him to come home. Mated with this monster of a father, she really must be a bad girl. It's so funny how much this little film seems to have been designed by an eight year old. I am very fond of this film, and as I say I think it is the finest animated film so far. It has an incredible cast, including Dick Van Dyke, who plays the giant and does a fantastic job with it. It really has a heart that's beating fast and if this were a regular motion picture it would have been great, but in this brief cut, it is so amusing and so clever.

The movie has a few moments that are quite funny but they are few and far in between.  A few of the characters are interesting and interesting characters.  It is a story about the relationship between a guy and a woman who is a bit crazy.  I think The Big Rube is a much better movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched the first half of this movie on a Tuesday evening about 5pm in the movie theatre at the University of Windsor (where I am currently working as a student), while waiting for the 3rd quarter finals to start.  This is a pretty standard family movie, there is no plot.  The family is an average one, no one is spectacular, it is just a normal, everyday family.  It takes a long time for the story to get going.  And it is a nice family movie.   The movie is narrated by a young girl, named Jenny (played by an extremely pretty blonde girl), about the time her father, a retired truck driver, and her mother, a very sickly woman, travel through Europe, to visit a sister and brother who are living in a village near Strasbourg.  Jenny's mother, has a disease which causes her to live a short life (10 years), and the family travels by bus, a small bus, to their sister and sister-in-law's house every few months.  Once again, I was waiting for something to happen.  After a couple of months, Jenny starts to see her sister's husband, and she has become attracted to him.  But Jenny and her mom don't see eye-to-eye about her relationship with her brother, and he starts to act jealous.  He tells Jenny that she is a bad sister, a bad daughter, a little slut who does what she wants and who should stay in her room.  In a twist, Jenny becomes the mother of two little girls (the twins), but Jenny also finds herself with new responsibilities, as well as a second husband.  A couple of years into this journey, Jenny gets pregnant, and the twins are born a week later.  I loved the way the story was told in this movie. The little characters had very human traits, and they had their own interests and problems.  The actors did a good job with their characters.  My only disappointment, is that I wish that Jenny's sister, and Jenny's husband had more scenes in this, in which they were less annoying.  As much as I enjoyed this movie, I also found it pretty boring, as there was just a lot of traveling, the mother kept talking about "the little sister and the little brother", the father just stood by as Jenny and the children visited their sister, so they could find out how much he cared about them,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So my first viewing of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" was not a happy one. It was a film about a very talented young man that just wanted to find his niche in life. His life was really an interesting one. He loved to sing and sing and perform as much as he could. He was quite a charmer. He got into a relationship with a beautiful girl that he really cared for.   After a few months of his life he met a girl that was just the best. They were just best friends and would go everywhere together.  They decided to move to New York to be closer to each other.  Walter has no idea that the girl he is dating is actually the daughter of a very wealthy businessman and has been taking care of her since she was just a baby.  She is a real powerhouse.  There is a lot of comedy in this movie, there is a little tragedy that comes along with Walter Mitteil and his new found love.  I felt like I was watching a sitcom. I felt this movie was very slow paced and not a good way to spend a day, but if you don't mind a slow pace and a little bit of sadness that comes with it, I really recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife had an amazing time at this movie. There were a few things that were a bit corny, like the fact that the main character is a professional who just "dislikes" a little girl, but I didn't mind too much. I think there were other parts where it was a bit over the top, like when the girl is getting her hair cut by a barber. But if you can get past that, this is a funny film. The ending with the old man playing the banjo (and a few more songs) was the best.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would have to say that this is one of the most exciting and entertaining movies I have seen in a while. The first half of the movie takes you through a story with a lot of twists and turns, the plot is quite intricate in a way. Once you know the rules the story really begins to take shape. This movie is a good mix between comedy, action and drama, the movie really is a great blend of both. It has a lot going on and is very entertaining. The film begins with an old woman who is very angry about the world. She has been on a mission from a woman she met on a bus in Hong Kong and she has decided to come back to Earth to tell everyone about how the world is a place of deception and she wants the world to know what is really going on in the world today. Her story is interrupted by a man who is running through the world killing everything he sees, but the old woman says she was sent by an alien to come and see all of the trouble the world was in. I thought the movie did a good job with the twist and turns the story took. It is good that it wasn't just a simple action movie. A lot of comedy was shown throughout the movie, but it wasn' t too serious in the way it should be.   The movie does a good Job of getting you involved with the characters, which is what it is supposed to do. The old woman is very realistic in her anger and in the end it was good to see that she would turn over a new leaf and get back to her old ways. The story is good at making you care about the characters. The villain of the story is a real character in the movie who is just as real and sympathetic as she is to the movie's audience.  One of the things I love about a movie like this is that it is not a complete fantasy or science fiction movie. The movie is not trying to be anything but a movie. It does have an alien element in it which adds to the enjoyment of the film, but no one is making a movie of aliens to begin with.  It has some great special effects in it and the movie has a good amount of action in it.  The acting in this movie is good, with some great actors who are doing their jobs to the best of their ability.  This movie was entertaining and entertaining.  Overall, I would rate it a 4/5.

It's great to see this movie in HD with new special effects (even though they are almost non-existent). The film is good, but not in a "I wanna be Batman" kind of way.  I found this to be one of the better Batman movies, but it wasn't the best Batman movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is the kind that one expects from the '80s TV series, but it's the performances that really set it apart.   "Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!" (it's a word!) is a film about the 1980's, and the people involved in it.  For a lot of viewers, it's easy to be put off by it because of it's obvious attempts at being a high school comedy.  It's really not.  The plot is a straight up '80's action-comedy.  All the guys on the show are playing the part of the gang that gets into trouble when they get arrested for shoplifting.  They're given a job and a couple of gang members get a little too friendly with a store owner.  And they end up with the store owner's daughter in their van.  But the trouble doesn't just stop there.  In a bizarre, and somewhat humorous way, they end-up with a gangster in jail.  So while the guys are out to get some justice, the gangsters have a little run-in with the local tough guy and are sent to the hospital.  "I don't know, is the old guy from 'MASH'?"   When they come back, they're all on trial and the town's chief magistrate is trying to get them to testify against each other so they can get a higher sentence.  When the prosecutor calls out a favor to a high-profile friend, the prosecutor realizes he might have a problem.  Is the real culprit trying to make a name for himself, or is there some other reason that might be a bit more sinister?   This isn't the sort of movie you expect to see at a big box store on a Monday night.  This film has enough to get a laugh and enough to make you look forward to the next installment.

This movie has such good acting and great action and so much fun.  So my two comments to the cast are that... 1) you can't take them all seriously and that's a bad thing. They are all good. 2) They don't have to have good accents to be funny. There are so many accents in this movie that is silly. 3) the kids in this film are all so goofy and goofy! They do everything from singing to jumping around the city in the middle of the night.  And now a review...   One of the best action movies I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the third movie in a row I've seen and enjoyed, with an old-school, no-nonsense, noir-tinged, dark, and dangerous vibe that doesn't let up once the camera is out. The best way to sum it up would be that it is a "Hollywood" (and more "Pulp" than "Western") crime movie with an almost-Western flair.   The acting and cinematography are fantastic.  My favorite was the role played by Sam Neill, a brilliant actor that is always the last one to realize a situation before the detective and his team do.  What I especially like is how the film is presented as a noir (or is it "Pulp"?) thriller, and how the crime is solved with some clever use of shadows, light, and shadow.  It is an excellent movie to watch and to read, with a good cast and great performances from everyone, and the suspenseful, sometimes violent crime scenes are worth the price of admission alone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - The Good   The main character is actually very endearing and likable (she's a teenager in love). She's also a really smart girl and gets a lot of life lessons from her parents about the importance of not judging people by how they look and how not to judge a book by its cover, even if the book looks good. The main storyline is a little cliche at first, but I didn't really mind.   I like how it was done and the main character was very endeared and likeable (if a little shallow). I wish there were more girls that were more likeable and had more character depth.  I wish I could see more girls in such a relationship, I know that there are many more girl-toys-with-a-pony-lover kind of things out there.  There are a lot to like about this movie, it's a little corny in places (I get a lot more mileage out of seeing some older woman do things like go for a ride), but overall I enjoyed it very much.

My husband was overjoyed. My son is a little bummed that the package was a bit late, but, as he was being "hitched around" by his uncle who had a "big load to carry", he was "excited" about his first Christmas. He couldn't wait for his big red Rudolph and his two snowmen. Thank you to the person who was kind enough to take time out of his schedule to send this out to me on a day when he had more important things to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never been one for horror films, but when I saw this I wasn't really expecting it to be any good, which is a good thing. It does not give you anything to look forward to. There is no sound at all to speak of, and the only thing that gets the audience to keep watching is the slow build up of horror and tension. You can see the blood on the ground, but it is just an after thought. You know that the movie is not going to end well, but at the same time, you don't feel the need to make any sudden moves or go to the bathroom. So the movie will continue to be in your mind for a while, and you can never be sure how the film is going to turn out.   It is a very good film, with a good story. I would definitely recommend it, and would recommend this movie to all horror fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Inception (2012) is a good idea (to make a film based on a book) and the movie is well made, but it's also made by a lot of people who know their way around.   It's not an easy movie to watch.  It has a very complex plot that will not be easy for a viewer to follow.  The story begins with a man named "James" (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) having been paralyzed from the waist down and wakes up in a strange world. James soon finds himself being hunted by two men who have no apparent reason for doing what they are doing.  With no memory of his past, James finds himself stuck in a nightmare world full of people wearing rubber suits. He learns that he is not alone in this new world, he also learns that there are others like him who have the same situation as him.  When James tries to escape from the world he finds himself trapped in a dreamlike dimension.  James tries desperately to keep up with the men hunting him. His best chance is to steal the memories of his other friends so they will know who he is and where he is from.  Although James is doing his best, the world is not the kind of place that is easy to live.  There is a war taking place in the parallel dimension between people with different "parallel identities" and in this war the memories from James' other friends are being used to fight the war, but James does not know the details and is not sure if he is in the right world.  Some of the other people in the world try to help James, but they also have their own problems.  They all start to have different ideas of how to solve the problem in the real world:  James' friend "James' (Leonardo DiCaprios) is sent to London to study with "Aristotle", who has been kidnapped by his own people and James is sent along to help him with his education.  Other people are sent to a different parallel world in the hope that this will help James with his problems.   This all comes to a head when the real Aristotle decides to return to the world of his people so he can find out who they are and what they have been doing to help the people in this parallel world.   James tries in his own way to find his friends and to stop the war between the two parallel worlds.  This movie has a lot going on, and
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great horror movie. I watched this with my husband and a friend and they all enjoyed it.   We also watched it with a small group of friends so I can't give a full rating but my husband gave it a very fair rating of 6 and my friend gave it 6 stars.  The story is about a group of people who go to a house to celebrate a birthday. What is supposed to be a party for 20 is turned into a horrible nightmare that you won't soon forget. The movie is very scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never saw this one in theaters but I watched it online on cable. I watched a good hour of the movie but it seemed to me that the movie just ended and I was waiting for the next episode. So, maybe there is going to be a series of new movies like the original, but this time it is all in black and white and it would be good if there were some color.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty much like the video game you play with your friends in middle school. And the main character has the same problem.   After a short time she decides to put on a show to the crowd to impress the boys. She is a big girl so there is no chance the boys would be interested.  But then they find out that she has a small dick so now they get a chance to suck that.  The guys really enjoy it but she doesn't like the attention.  There are scenes where she tells some guy on the street to come up to the park and get a good view.  After they do he is able to see a very nice cock but she is all like "no, no, no!"   But she gets a huge orgasm which she says was the best she has ever had.  This is a very cute movie.  It was a little cheesy but if you want to see something cute and fun and full of hot chicks it is a good start.  (click here to watch on YouTube)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So i had to see this movie because i live in chicago and if you are a fan of the first one it should be in your collection. I saw it a week ago and i must say it is so very different. Not to say the first was terrible but i feel like i am watching the first part of a new movie. It is dark and creepy but still has a good amount of humor in it. The actors and actresses are all very likable and the music is also very good and the story is a very good one with a nice ending which i feel is worth seeing. I give it a 5 star rating because i feel it is a good dark comedy which is definitely worth watching!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "In case you've never seen it, you will!   This film is a brilliant adaptation of a classic short story by Henry James.   It's the story of two very different people who meet on a train journey, the woman who wants to stay alone in a small country town, the widower who's a bit of a character with a lot of secrets."    - A film that's got a lot going for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most interesting horror movies I have ever seen. This is a great example of what a great horror movie should be. I had a wonderful time watching this movie. This movie is a masterpiece. This film is a true example of great horror, great acting, great special effects, great gore, great horror music, great makeup, and even a great villain.   This is one of the finest films I have seen in the last couple of years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a nutshell: A good movie with a very good script. I did not find the performances to be spectacular (it did not seem as though they were cast as actors, but as a whole) the movie was very well acted, but there were no great performances either, and there are no outstanding or bad performances either. The performances of the male characters seemed a bit lacking, but the female characters were also a bit bland. The movie was good, if you have not seen any of the other films, and a good reminder of how to make a good horror film, this one is for those who like a bit more horror and a bit less comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A pretty good movie that isn't the most thrilling or action-packed, but it's pretty entertaining. It has all the elements needed for a good thriller, but doesn't take long to get there. It's well-acted and suspenseful, and the story and characters are well-developed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this about a year ago, and it was a fun watch. The story is a good one. I liked how the plot kept me hooked and entertained. There is a little sexual content in this movie (which I wouldn't have minded so much in the slightest, but there were plenty of other things going on). It's not an original story, but I don't really see a need to change it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a child, the American animated film "The Fox and the Hound" was my first exposure to this breed of canine, a hound with a white coat, a yellow face and an even yellow belly. It had two eyes and two ears like a rabbit and, while I do not think it has a very long tail, it was still very cute. I remember that I would get very excited when I saw that animal running with a ball and that it would sometimes get away and come right back again. I loved watching it. Then my older sister came along and told me about this animal. She told me that it was a friendly dog and it liked to play with us. I asked her to come along with me. We took a small, red wagon and went to the farm. The farm seemed to be an old English country farm, which was not very pretty but was a pleasant place to be. It is a very charming place, full of old trees, and there was a little wooden shed where a dog lived and worked. The dog was an American pit bull type dog, but not as large as a Great Dane, and not as thin as a Doberman. It was a nice, gentle, intelligent dog, and the girl told me it liked going for a walk or playing in the garden. I think the owner was a gentle, old farmer, so he was not the cruel type. I was always so afraid of dogs that I did not want to be anywhere near the house when the dog was there, because I knew what he would do to me. I did, however, like to sit in the carriage when I was in the house, watching the dog. When it was in my hands, it behaved itself in such a way that it seemed to want me to ride on its back. Sometimes I was really frightened, especially when I went away and came back, and sometimes I could not wait to go away again and come back as soon as I was able. At that time I felt so happy when I rode the animal. One day the little girl was playing with the dog, so I jumped up on her chair and kissed her. It did not seem to mind at all. Then the dog ran into the garden and jumped down into the water with a splash, not knowing what was going to happen, and when it went under water I was scared. But the dog went back out of the garden into the farm shed, not noticing a drop
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this film, I was immediately interested. I was not really expecting much for this film other than a cheap imitation of Hitchcock's movies and it did disappoint a bit, but it was enjoyable. However, I'm beginning to think that the plot just wasn't that great and the acting was weak. I think the character design was okay. I liked the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing I noticed about this movie was the voice acting, and it was great!   I was so excited to see this movie because I'm so into the whole space/aliens/droid thing.   When I was younger, I had a dream that when I was grown, I was going to meet an alien in a movie theater and then go to his planet to live with him.  When i saw that movie, I saw it as a movie about an alien who wants to go to earth, because he has been in a long time in space (and space travel is his favorite thing to do), and is lonely because he is not human.  There is also a guy who lives in a house that the alien can get in and out of and he likes the alien a lot.  One thing that I really like about this film is that they are using the film to educate the kids about space and aliens.  The alien is so cool, especially when he says "I have seen the future!"   There was also a great alien robot, called MUD that the aliens made to go out and do some stuff for them, like to eat.  I think the film was about three days in space, so a lot of space and time travel stuff went on in this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a masterpiece with a very powerful story with a deep plot. The story itself is told in a simple manner which is very interesting. It does not take long to understand why the people of the world are in so much trouble. After a while, the film makes us realize why. And then the final scene makes it all worthwhile. I really liked this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a good book you have to read it slowly because the story is so interesting. I really liked the characters and the way the movie was made. It's about a guy who can transform into a fish and a dog. His best friend can turn into a horse and a monkey. And his parents live in the house where the fish and dog eat and drink and sleep.   I have to admit that I laughed out loud a few times because of the jokes the dog makes at the fish's expense.  I think the movie is funny in a way I hadn't seen before. It has an ending which will make the reader cry because of a funny thing that happens. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film tells a very sad story about a father and son who are separated by death. The father is a man with a strong religious nature, who believes in his son and tries to persuade him of the necessity of carrying out his mission. However, his son refuses and ends up being sent into a wilderness camp, where he tries to become a human being in a land that seems to exist outside the boundaries of time and space.   This is a film that was made with an interesting idea and one that I would recommend to anyone who has had enough of the 'cute' and 'dumb' Disney films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so happy I finally watched this movie with my wife. We were going to do a double feature, but when we left, we were greeted with an invitation from the theater manager. She came up to us to take our name and number, and she brought over a small bag from the lobby with a DVD in it. She handed it to us, and we opened the bag and got to watching this movie. It was pretty good, the movie was well shot, and there was a couple of great scenes in this one. We found ourselves laughing our asses off at a lot of different things throughout the movie, and at least the movie didn't try to do too many things for a comedy.

I'd kill to have a girl as much as my wife. This is a beautiful movie and I can't wait to see it again.    Rated 4 out of 5   A very unique film about life and death.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of things went right for me in this movie. We start with the typical "dude meets his girlfriend" thing. So we have a man that is a big fan of the sport and plays it pretty seriously, and is really good at it. He has a girlfriend, but he can be kinda dumb sometimes. That is, until she shows up and he is able to get it up with her and the two have a great time together. They go to a baseball game and it is just plain good. Then the story starts.   The movie takes place in the small town of "Marlowe". The place is a pretty typical small town. There are a lot of people, a few cars, and the roads are generally pretty quiet and clear. The towns people tend to think of themselves as pretty good, but a lot are a bit more of a jerk than they could have been. One guy in particular is very annoying, and he seems to be very proud of himself in the way he talks about and handles women. So, the movie starts out fairly good. The first thing that does go bad is the guy that starts out the movie. He is a bit too much of a douche for his own good.  He tries to get a date with a girl that doesn't want to go, and when she eventually decides to go with him anyway he immediately gets annoyed when he finds out she had a boyfriend the whole time. He gets a bit cocky about his relationship and goes into a pretty big argument with the guy she is dating. The girl is so impressed by him though that she decides to be his girlfriend.  Another girl who is there is very, very impressed by the guy. She has heard that she is pretty good with him, and so she decides she would rather be with him. The whole movie then just plays out as a pretty good baseball game between two pretty good guys.  I think this would be a pretty easy movie to make into a good romance, and I think it could easily be an entertaining one at that.  It has some good acting, and a nice baseball theme.  A pretty good movie overall, and if you are a baseball fan, or a guy that likes a good baseball movie, I think you would enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found the movie to be a very good drama about a father and his two young boys. The father who works at a small store, gets into a car accident and is left a quadriplegic. As he gets better, he decides to move his family into a new house. He is a good husband and father and works at the new house, not long after he has bought it. He can barely stand, but still has fun being with his kids. One day when he is driving home, his family suddenly stops dead in their tracks, when they see something very strange. In the sky, a giant bird is fluttering and flying around. The bird is not a bird, it is a gigantic human with a large head and eyes and a thin arm and hand. The human is talking to them in a very strange manner, while he is flying around and playing with them. He keeps asking them to come and see him, but when he finally is able to talk to them, they are scared and run away. The next morning, the man and his wife find a letter from the mother who had died in the car accident, and who has been reading letters for years, asking for a big house and a dog, when she finally gets home. This movie is really a good drama, with some good acting, good directing and the use of a good soundtrack. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a nice movie and I like the characters a lot. They have a good time at the lake and then they're captured and they are all in fear. They are brought to a castle but they are not able to escape because the door has been made of glass. But they make a escape. In the end, they are released and they fight off the soldiers. I don't know if the movie was a success or not. But it's a good story and it's very entertaining and I liked it. I didn't get it for sure but it's good entertainment.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very funny, and it has a very original concept.   The movie is all about a girl named Anna (Natalie Portman) who is the most popular girl in school and is being bullied by one of the guys named Alex (David Spade). When the other girls find out Alex is gay, she decides to tell everyone about it. She decides to go to a beach with the other boys and have some fun and she starts to be a little too forward. This leads to a misunderstanding with Alex, who is a little shy, and after a few false starts they decide to go back to the beach. The movie keeps the humor and makes the relationship between the two characters interesting.  It also is very entertaining, and makes you want to see more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great, good, good movie. It has a story that is both funny and dramatic, and it's well acted too.   As far as the story goes:  The whole film takes place at a high school where, for some reason, the teachers, principal and student body hate each other. They have never liked each other before. They seem to dislike one another right up to the end, but at the end they all end up agreeing to move the graduation date for the two losers from the top of the grade to a higher school.  There were other parts that I enjoyed about the film:  A character's dad tries to kill his son, then tells him he's going to kill him as well. This makes a little more sense, and the fact that he tries to do it in front of his son is funny.  This happens at a movie theatre, but the movie doesn't stop for a while after the credits.  I liked the way they filmed it.  It was fun to watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think we can all agree that "The Hobbit" is one of the greatest trilogies that has ever been told. The movie is beautifully shot, written, and acted. There are not many movies where I have watched actors in front of a camera as the title character. I have enjoyed the films so much, that when I saw the trailer I knew I would be watching "The Lord of the Rings". The movie was great. I was not disappointed. A good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a very well-done, fun movie about a guy named Peter Pan who is a magical boy and must take on the roles of various characters from the classic book by J. M. Barrie.   It has a good mix of action and laughs, and is pretty fun as long as you don't try to take the role of Pan by doing things like swinging from a tree branch or riding on a broomstick.  I can only imagine the thrill of a boy who can walk up walls and fly with the help of a little girl named Wendy and the best part of the movie is when they take a little break to have some apple pie and watch a magic show.  It is very funny and has a great story behind it.  Overall, it was fun to watch and it is recommended to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is probably my favorite movie of all time. It's an action movie with a heavy emphasis on martial arts and a lot of action and it doesn't disappoint.   The movie was made at the end of the 70's so it has a very rough look to it. It looks very amateurish but that makes sense considering the time that it was made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie from a very promising movie-making team!   My name is James, a young American tourist who has been living in Rome, Italy, with his wife and baby daughter. One day a local man with a motorcycle hits him from behind. My wife, who had been walking with me, was knocked over. I can only see the bike in front of me coming toward me.   The movie is about a group of people on a motorcycle. As the motorcycle rolls down the hill my wife is pulled down. I try to climb on but can't go fast enough. The motorcycle hits the ground, my wife gets up and is taken down. My son is trying to run but falls to the ground. The group, myself included, are afraid of the dark. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film follows two teenagers. The first kid is a bit of a goof. The second kid is kind of a "he" and is the most interesting person in the movie, except for the girl. The characters of the film are not bad. They are average and it shows a bit. However, it's interesting to see a character like this one who is in a situation similar to what a kid in this kind of films is in. I also liked the music in the film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a little disappointing. I didn't see any way this movie could be good. I don't mind the movie so much because the actors do a great job of doing what they do and are believable as the characters. However, this movie is like a bad version of "The Big Lebowski". The actors do their best but the story is completely unrealistic and lame. I am glad I didn 't pay to see this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I can't think of one movie where a bunch of people are actually friends, maybe it's time for me to consider getting rid of this whole genre altogether.   I love 'Titanic.'   It's one of those movies that's got great acting, great scenery, great songs, and amazing scenery.  It's also got one of the greatest characters in the history of cinema, a woman who at the end of it all is so incredibly beautiful that it's easy to forget just how sad she is.  It was easy to see her as one of my favorite characters of all time (and probably my favorite female character ever).   The acting was top-notch from the likes of Jack Huston and even later in the film it was great from the great Marlon Brando and of course Carrie.  All of these roles are good, but nothing can beat the scenes where they get together in the end, where Brando really takes a moment to show just how much he respects and loves her and how he really wants to go out with her when she's alive and well.  I think I could cry and I don't think I have ever cried so hard in my life.  She's a woman to be cherished.  When I think about the life of a woman like Kate Winslet and how far she went to be with her dream of becoming a director and film maker and to become one of Hollywood's greats, I'm reminded of a quote that I love by the great French movie director Jean-Luc Godard: "It's a great day when there are no dreams, it's a bad day when a woman has no dreams."  It seems like every year there's a new movie about a woman whose dream is to make movies and make them really well. Now that's a very exciting dream. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie since it's first run in theaters. The story is well-done, there is enough action to keep me guessing, and the characters are all interesting. As a matter of fact, I found it a pretty good movie overall!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a good old school western from the early 20th century.   I did not like the story as much as the movie but it is worth a watch.  I have no idea how long the movie takes to get to the story but the movie really is an entertaining story.  When I saw the trailer I was really excited to see this movie because the story was really good.  I found the movie to be enjoyable but I did find that the first half of the movie was too long.  The film is very well written and the actors were very good in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If the "credits" don't get you, the rest of the movie does. It has a pretty well-done villain with a strong and satisfying motivations that makes him all the more interesting, as well as a great supporting cast. The cast is a strong one as well, especially with the addition of Josh Duhamel, who plays the lead role quite well. If you are looking for a very fun movie with some great performances, you will find it in this one. If not, then you will have some fun with a great story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been a fan of the movie since it first came out (when it was titled The Goonies).   It was a comedy/thriller/mystery that was not for the faint of heart, but it gave a lot of fun.   The movie had the main characters all dressed up as kids.  But they were all dressed as the Goonies, so no matter what, the kids are a bunch of kids. This is a movie where you have kids who have all of the best and silliest jokes.  They do not come in and say "I wanna be a Goon" or "I want to be a pirate". They come in with a zany attitude and a huge personality.  The film also has the best, most interesting movie villain (who may be the movie's best) and is also the most entertaining.  My favorites are:  Captain Gooey (his name is Captain Goop) - is a Gooney character. His name is Goop and his costume is a pirate's outfit.  He hates "the Goon's".  He has a really big nose and is wearing a cape. He is always the villain.  "Sugar Man" - is the most annoying character in the movie.  He can't tell the difference between food and sugar.  When a kid eats food for him, he goes nuts (like when a kid plays with sugar in the theater).  His favorite thing is to throw food at the kids. He thinks the goons eat all the candy and he wants to be the next to be eaten.  One of my favorite scenes.  And to the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this one a lot. It was funny, and also a little sad at times.   And then it would end with "It was just a game, that's all"   It's a bit of a cliche, but I really liked it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had heard good things about this film but I had not seen it till now. The story is about a poor girl who does nothing to earn money in her village. Then her aunt, who is always helping her and is in love with her, helps her to go and work in the city, where she gets to meet an older, richer man who is a big name in the game of cricket. After the start of their romance she suddenly finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy and murders on a very bad level. This is one of the most depressing films I've seen. The only saving grace is that it has a great song and a good screenplay.    (19.3)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film I saw about the cult of the serial killer killer that killed many women by poisoning their drinks at a popular bar was awful. I had a problem with the plot and how the killer was portrayed. This film, with the same actors, and the same director (Sterling Knight), is much better. The movie starts with a killer that is never clearly defined. The camera follows his movements but never lets you know who the killer is. He seems to only kill women and then disappear. You see people's reactions to the crime. There is a psychiatrist who tries to determine the killer's motives. He goes to the murder scenes and tries to find the killer. He uses this to create his own theory and uses this in a film that he thinks will make people pay attention. I thought the movie was interesting but too much so to be good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good comedy about a bad mother.   The plot is very stupid.  If you don't understand a word of it and think the movie is so funny and well directed then you are really stupid.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was not your usual Hollywood romantic comedy.   The screenplay was pretty much a remake of the movie "Love is a Many Splendored Thing" and the director decided to keep the plot from the movie, but change the romance. This was a good thing!   In the movie the characters were all pretty much one dimensional, so when they got together they had to develop a love for each other (this was done by the actor) and then it was love at first sight (with the exception of the wife, but they are the same sex).   I think that it is a good idea for an American movie to not put the characters through the usual Disney style (I don't think so much Disney and more like the Italian version of this). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can honestly say that this movie was one of the best I have seen in a long time. I really liked the idea of a group of friends who get to visit a place with a big history. I found the story very interesting and the acting was good.

The actors were all excellent, the cast was fun and really seemed to care about the characters. The movie had a lot of action scenes that were really quite awesome. I found it funny how the character's names were like a running gag. For instance, "Rikki" would be played by the daughter of one of the lead characters in a recent episode and he gets a call that his daughter has had an accident. He would then run to the scene and find a girl who had her clothes off, and was in the hospital with serious injuries. I was very excited for the film to be released because it seemed to be one of those shows where they always have a great cast of actors. This movie is worth watching! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It is a very good watch with a strong storyline. If you like any movie with a very strong plot that is not predictable, then you should watch this.   The cast was great and the writing was also very good. It made me feel a lot of emotions and I was crying a lot.

You know that thing where you're watching a comedy and you're laughing and you can't be arsed to go to bed? Well I was laughing and it didn't take me long to make a quick bed. This movie had it all and the funniest ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-made, entertaining, witty and funny movie about how a family of three comes to grips with the loss of a loved one.   This was a well-produced, well-acted movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story about how life can be when a person has lost a loved-one.  The movie is very well made and it was a great way to cope with the sorrow of losing a brother.  This is the first movie I have seen where the family is shown as being very strong, united and supportive and also has some light humor.  If you can find this movie, watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is awesome.  I love it.    See more ▼ See less ▲  Jurassic Park: The Lost World (1996) 8/10 There's not really anything wrong with this movie, but I do feel the movie is missing one thing: a little bit of the original 'Jurrasic Park' theme.  This should have been the movie where they went back to the island and brought the dinosaurs back, but they got lazy and went to the 'future' where the dinosaurs had all become genetically mutated into some new kind of life form that couldn't be tamed.  It's not like there's anything wrong to this movie. It's simply a good story, good acting, and a nice set of monsters.  The whole thing is a lot better than the original.  The movie: 7/10 (if you have any expectations about the story, it's a lot of story, which is a huge part of the attraction).   After seeing Jurassic Park III (2001) and Jurassic Park IV (2006) and finding them lacking, I expected a little more from Jurassic Park: Lost World. I felt this movie did exactly what it was supposed to do, which was to show the movie and Jurassic World in its best light, but the original Jurassic Park is the only movie that I've seen that truly takes you to a totally different world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most exciting movie I have seen in a long time. And I really didn't expect that for a movie that's so bad and full of flaws.   Like most American movies, the story is really good. The characters are good and well played and the plot is good too.  But as I said in the beginning, the movie is full of faults and mistakes.  The biggest one is the plot. I would say that it has only 7 major things: 1) The evil boss who's trying to kill all the workers 2) The secret weapon 3) The worker who has the secret weapon 4) The hero 5) The girl who has an evil past 6) The villain's family. All that happened in 6 years of the movie. That makes no sense.  This movie was made with a lot of money and a lot has been done and it is all very well done. But as it is, it was so poorly done that it made me wonder why they were making this film and not making a movie about the war in Vietnam.  It could have been good. But it is not.  I really think the makers of this movie should give it to the VCR so that all the actors could get together and make a better movie.  And I think the movie makers should give them a new title. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film itself is a decent little film with a very clever gimmick. It takes the format of a modern film about a detective who has to deal with a man who has been murdered while investigating a murder. There's a bit of action here and there, and the film ends with a neat twist which has you on the edge of your seat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like the movie because it takes place in a futuristic environment where there is a large army of robots that are controlled by the computer in the background. This movie is the third in a series called "I, Robot" which follows this robotic character through his adventures. The main character, "I.R.O.", is a robot whose main goal in life is to create a family. He has two children, named "I" and "J.R.".   He goes through various events that will keep his family safe and happy as well as give him his name which is not "I", but "I Robot". I really recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot of the movie is pretty simple but the effects are very well done. It is a film about a group of misfits who have a contest for a chance to become a member of a secret organization called The F.B.I. This is where the fun starts. The story goes as a group, with some friends that have no common interests. The film starts as they are trying to make a movie. After some failed attempts they stumble upon a mysterious mansion that's full of secret passages and traps. They get more into trouble as they try to get to the end of the mansion in order to win a prize. This leads them on a wild journey that takes them through some fun locations such as a bowling alley, a carnival and even a pirate ship. I found this film to be a pretty interesting film, it is not without some problems but the story is intriguing and the characters are enjoyable. The effects, however, are not quite perfect. I have seen worse but I did not find them as distracting as the first 2 or 3 movies. The performances, however are great and I found it difficult to separate some of the characters from one another. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I watched this movie I was completely in awe of this young genius. As soon as I saw this movie, I knew it was the greatest. This was my first viewing of a movie so far this year and it had me in awe. The plot was clever, the acting was great, and it was really a great time. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of movies. The movie doesn't hold a candle to the first one I watched (that was the one that made me want to do a lot of reading and research for the rest of my life). But if you have seen the first movie, and you haven't seen this one, then you have a good excuse.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sorry that they can't even get the concept of a family movie right. The family gets to the movie theater only to find out that the kids are out for the day. They go to the theater to find the new Batman movie is playing. The movie begins with the kids playing a game of a card game. The game is a little boring, so the family gets bored. They take the kids to the movies where they try to find someone to watch a movie with them, but there are no choices. There is also a lot of yelling in the movie which is also very distracting. The story line is very poor, the parents are very boring, and even the kids aren't interesting.   It's one of those movies that should be made a series, and I wonder why. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are in the mood for a good old-fashioned western comedy, a good idea is to enjoy The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.     It's a good western at the time it was made, with a great ending that left the audience quite satisfied. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie a few times on DVD. It's very good for a quick film to watch, and it does that. The movie does start with a "sneak peak" at the first film, in a film that will remind you of a few scenes in the first one. The film opens with a shot of a couple having sex, and we see them slowly getting closer and closer to each other, as the man tries to take over the woman's head and make her his personal sex toy. He can't because she has a very large breasts, and when she finally takes her top off we see that this girl is an expert at giving head. I always wondered why a woman who was as large as her breasts would choose to use a man's dick for her pleasure. After a good bit of talking and kissing we are back in the bedroom, and she is doing some very naughty things. After some "hiding" in the toilet, we see the man take the woman to the bedroom and force her to eat her pussy. He's on a rampage now and he really is a bad boy. The woman seems to enjoy the taste of his cock. The scene takes off at a good clip. I found it to be a good mix of old and new. The story is just a little bit cliched, but it's fun to watch. I think it's a good little movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would love to give a more detailed review about the movie, but I only have about 4 minutes of it and it was so interesting and emotional.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like this movie because the plot line is so interesting and it starts from a normal situation but ends up being really dramatic and fun to watch. The music is also awesome because the story line is really interesting and is really well paced, I like how it starts off and then slowly goes deeper in that they're finding out the bad things about the person, then it goes up in the climax which is so good in it's simplicity, so I like the beginning of it because it was so cute and innocent and not like a lot of comedies that you see and a lot don't seem to care about what they do to each other, but this is one of them and it's so funny and makes you laugh like a kid on christmas when he finds out that his favorite Christmas present is in another person.   I like that the movie isn't as long as a lot but it's still a really good movie.

I had a great time seeing it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Haunting is a film of the highest order. It has an extremely high budget, but is a work of genuine achievement. I was worried the film would be a slow drag, but it never is. It was an absolute joy to watch. The film is made with such care and passion, and with such skill as well. And the acting is outstanding. The most striking thing is the atmosphere. It is a completely unique world that is totally unlike anything else. The sound, acting and costumes are all done with care and art. The only thing I can say is that I hope this will be a model for the rest of the horror films made this year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (I love this film) I saw this movie during the summer of 1997 at a small cinema in my hometown of Santa Ana, California. I remember seeing a few other movies at the time, but this was the first one that stood out for me. There is a lot of film going on here and a lot going on behind the scenes. The characters are complex and real. I really like the way they are portrayed and I feel that the actors who played the parts really captured the emotion and emotion of the characters.    The story follows two families. One family is middle class and the other is poor. The first family consists of a husband, a wife and a son who is the father of the two boys. One day, the family is visited by a stranger who tells them that he has a son he wants to help. They agree and the stranger brings his son to the house to live with them. The family is very shocked, but they accept the help. The boy seems to be more a burden than an addition and the first family is upset with how he is treated and how he has been brought up. The next morning, the father tells his wife he will be going out to work and will be back to get the boy the next evening. The wife asks the neighbor for help in finding a way to get a job. He tells her she would need a good salesman who has great self-confidence and who would want the job. So the wife asks a friend of her son to help her find the right salesman. The neighbor, who is a very wealthy man, decides to help the wife and her friend find a salesman. He also helps the father and son in finding the right person to help them.  (I really liked this movie. I think it had a lot to do with my interest in the film industry.  This was also the first movie I saw in a small town so I was able to feel connected with the characters and see the movie in a way I had not experienced before.  )

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so disappointed that I was not able to watch this at all.  I don't want to go to the movies, but I'd really like to.   This was my first time watching a movie about the "War On Drugs", but it was not a bad movie.  It is a bad idea.  They're not really drug dealers.  These guys are not getting rich.  The main character is a nice person.  That being said, he is a drug dealer who gets caught up in a high tech crime.  This movie, I really wanted to go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In many ways this is an example of a good sequel. The film is largely the same, even as the plot continues to move along in a more traditional manner.   It's interesting how the film moves along so smoothly, although at times it does seem that the filmmakers are getting lazy with the direction.  And yes, it's a sequel, with the same characters, but a different plotline.  There's certainly plenty to enjoy about this film, and the way it moves through its scenes does a nice job of bringing out the more humorous aspects of the characters.  As is the case with any sequel, the story will probably be overshadowed by the characters and plot, but it's always nice to see how well the characters are portrayed.  One of the things I really liked about the characters was their lack of self awareness.  Most of the time the characters acted in ways that had been previously shown or hinted at, and then it's just up to the audience to figure out why they are behaving in the way they are, especially when the answers can be quite obvious.  The dialogue was occasionally a little clumsy, with some of the dialog being just too simplistic, but other times it was very funny.  However, a very common problem with sequels is that some of these characters are given a lot of screen time, and others are reduced.  In this case, it was the former, with many scenes of the actors playing their own parts.  Again, I found this to be a nice change of pace from the more realistic and well thought out scenes of last year's film.  Overall, it is a pleasant little movie, with a lot to offer in both comedy and drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a big fan of   in the 70's and 80's but the movie has grown old now.   As I said this is not a typical movie about a girl growing up to be a teenager.  The movie has a few great scenes but there is a major problem with   it.  I don't like the acting in   all the movies that I have seen the characters in,  It is just bad.  And it is not the best acting I have ever seen either,  it is just a bad movie,  in which you get a bad girl who is always doing bad things for her  self.  As you see she does not really care about anybody, she just wants to be able to use  things.  She is very much like   The Joker,  You can't really like them but when they are on screen they are a big laugh.  There are also some really good scenes but they are also really bad and very uncharacteristic of the girl I had always known as a little kid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have read many books and seen many movies about "The Old West." I'm not an expert, but I don't know how to tell the difference between the real West and the movie "Dawn of the Dead."   First of all, the story is amazing. I don' t think this is the first film by an "old man" who is trying to survive, but the way the man uses his gun and the clothes he wears is fantastic. It has the same feel that "The Man Who Wasn't There" had for me.   A real work of art.  I love the characters and how they deal with the "dangers" in the story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is about a woman who is obsessed with her appearance and who spends hours upon hours in a salon trying to perfect her appearance.  But she is an artist and her passion is not only her aesthetic sense, but also the creation of new works of art.  She tries to improve her physical appearance and her mental appearance in an attempt to be taken seriously in her art.    The main character is the salon owner, who is fascinated with the work of her "mistress".  She is a very nice lady and very well dressed, but she is very disturbed by her appearance which she says has no soul and no value.  This film is very well made, very realistic and quite disturbing, as if the main character was talking about herself as a character in a movie.   This was one of those films that you just can not put down.  It is funny, disturbing, sexy, well acted and filled with beauty and eroticism. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a long-time fan of David Cronenberg and of other artists of the so-called 'Aeroplane School', I was anxious to see this film. I was also glad to discover it was not a remake.   The film is really about a woman who is very unhappy with her life. She has three kids, her ex-husband who is a loser and is a bad influence on her kids, and also has a drinking problem. She lives in a small town in rural Nebraska with her husband's family. The father-in-law is an alcoholic and has a very ugly daughter who seems to love her daddy more than she does him. She is a terrible actress and is very well known to her family because she makes them laugh and tell her a story. So what the wife has done to become this sad housewife is to have a husband who is always drunk and always tells a story and always plays a game with the kids when they are young. And a daughter who is completely self-centered and completely useless. One of the three kids is really sickly so she is not much help at all.        She is so much better off with her kids than she is with the husband.  This film has a lot of humor and a lot to say about the world of people with all their crazy ideas.  It has a great soundtrack by David Bowie and also by Jerry Jeff Walker.  What the film is a good story about the loneliness and loss of being a wife. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an action movie. It is a classic action movie from the 40s. It has a little romance between the main character and his wife and also has some humor. It reminds me a bit of the movies of the same year of 1939-40. This movie will remind you of a few action movies you may have seen. You will see a little bit of romance too and the action is very good.

The reason for writing this review is I think it is an interesting look at the development of a man's life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For any movie fans that have seen the movies "Ghostbusters" and "Ghostbuster II", you must have a great time watching this awesome flick "Ghost" which is the sequel to "Ghost Busters", "Ghost." I am surprised that this movie has not gotten much praise for being an amazing movie which has got a plot line about a group of people, who go into a haunted house in a search for help but instead they end up getting the most frightening experiences one can imagine.   I was shocked at how good the effects are. I will have to say that the effects were not too big but I can't find any fault in this movie as it is really good. I have seen it twice and my wife and I have been watching it for several nights in a row.  This is an awesome movie that I recommend to all my friends and relatives as it has been a great horror film that I have enjoyed watching a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. My kids loved it. My wife loved it, too. My favorite scene in the movie was when they went fishing. The whole time the boat was sinking, the kids had to be in the water. They went underwater several times. When they were finally able to get off, they walked up a mountain. They were walking on a rocky beach. The movie got the kids' attention. The next morning, my wife woke me up to tell me that she and the kids were getting dressed to go fishing. My son asked how long it was going to take. I said, "It's getting to be too cold for the kids." I had no clue it was so long. There is one more scene in this movie that I enjoyed.    There is a girl in this film who was very hot, and she was an astronaut. I was so jealous because she seemed to be as tall as I am.  And my husband liked this film too. It was about a little boy who is trying to find his father. When he did, he found out he didn't have a father. But he doesn't blame the man for the father he had. It's a happy ending and an educational film for the parents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've enjoyed a couple of other films in this same vein as this one. The difference is that I enjoyed these movies more than I enjoyed the one in which the same characters are set up.    The movie does a wonderful job of showcasing the differences between our characters, our parents, and our son in his teens. I also found the acting to be somewhat strong.  For the most part I found the story to be good, I just wanted the movie to wrap up a bit faster so that the characters would be a bit more developed.  Overall a good story, a good ending, a very good movie.

Bill is the best part of this movie. He's the only person who really does anything of note for this movie, which is surprising, since he's probably the dumbest person in the film. He is a man who has had everything handed to him by the system.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never really heard much about it, but I was pretty excited to check it out. It has a very interesting concept. The premise is the story of two guys trying to find the girl of their dreams.   "It's a lot like a game of thrones but there's a twist."   The twist of the story is that the game is rigged. In an attempt to avoid his "destruction" by the king of the kingdom, the king tries to have the king killed.  So there you have it: the ultimate thieving-game   One of the things that drew me to this movie was the fact that a lot of the characters were real people. There's one for example, named D'Lugo, who is the king's bodyguard. The movie was also quite entertaining.

But they do have some great scenes that I thought would be great to see them done again.  This is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a classic that every student should see at least once.   The film shows a real life story that the parents do not want the kids to know about.  It is a short, but touching, film about a boy named Jimmy and his dog called "Toby".   It will also show how a boy can be kind hearted, a father can be a better man than he seems and a dog can be the best friend a man could ever have.  1/5 stars.

Part one of two is very interesting as the movie takes place in a village with a population of 725 souls (a bit too many), which were relocated to a refugee camp after the Nazis conquered the village in 1942. A large part of the movie is taken up by the refugees living in the refugee camp and it is interesting to see the tensions and difficulties they have. The movie is about a group of 7 men who have been living in a refugee colony for about 6 months. The main character is a priest who was sent to the camp by the German Army as a priest to assist the refugees there. He is kind, compassionate, patient, and honest and it all comes to a head when one of the refugees, a widower, murders the head priest. The film is told from the refugees point of view and although some parts of it were interesting, most of the story just fell a bit flat for me. The only things that stood out to me was the characters, the art, and a few good shots of the countryside.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found it so strange that two men of such different worlds could come together so quickly. It made sense that this was the case because of their different circumstances. The first is a white-collar worker, with an average lifestyle. The second is a high-profile CEO, a man who lived a rough life and who would sacrifice anything for the sake of his children. I am told that the second man is in a relationship and is in debt and will take the job to pay off his debts. If you can imagine a movie where these two people come together in a high powered job with a good life to save, then this is it. I found the film very emotional and I was reminded of "The Princess Bride" and "Jurassic Park." There are many scenes that I found very touching and I also loved a bit about a man named Mr. A who I thought was a good and decent man until he saw the future. It was like a nightmare come true that we are watching. I think it is a pity that we will not see this film much in the future because of the amazing characters it produced. It is also worth to note that the actors are very good and the story is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this one. The plot, it's not too complicated, there are plenty of bad guys and there are enough good characters in the movie. The movie is about a family that wants to buy a vacation home for their daughter, and there is a problem, the house was built a while ago, and the whole thing is really old and rusty. But, the family is happy, and they are enjoying their time there, until one day, they hear a noise from the attic and find a monster there.   The monster is a girl that is a little bit older and is very violent. But after she kills her family, she is left alone with the only thing that is left, a little boy. The boy is only 13 years old, but he is a powerful young man and a lot of people are afraid of him.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie and wish I would have watched it before I did something else.   The story is like that of an old Western. It takes place in 1848 where the western frontier has become a frontier of poverty and crime.  I don't care for the "The Lone Ranger" and don't think I would enjoy this movie very much either.  It doesn't do much to advance the plot except for the opening scene. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You may have noticed by now that I'm not a huge fan of The Amazing Spider-Man. I think that's partly because I'm a huge superhero fan, and partly because it's an expensive movie. And yet, when I saw it, I couldn't stop thinking about it.   My first thought was, "Man, I wish he had spent more time in school and not had to be this big man." I also thought, "I hope I'm watching the wrong movie!"   It's not like it's any easier on Spidey. It's a very slow, boring movie with lots of tedious dialogue, no real action, and lots of "oh well, there it is" moments.  One of the biggest issues with this film is that it takes so long to get going. The movie is actually about 2/3rds of the way in when Peter finally decides to tell Aunt May his secret and they start to date.  A good time for a Spider-man movie...   And yet for some reason, I didn't get a kick out of it. The only reason I haven't given up on Spider-Gwen yet is because she's my favourite character.    But I'm probably just the type that doesn't like seeing characters die too quickly.  And even if that weren't the case, why would Peter keep telling Aunt May the same lie?   That's not something that happens in a superhero movie. I thought for a long time that the story was going to be about the rivalry between the Gwen Stacey and Mary Jane Watson characters, but the film takes an alternate route and goes straight into the second act.  This is a movie about a Spider.  The thing is, Spideys really are a pain in the butt.  Spider-gwen is an excellent character, but she's never really given enough time to develop or grow.  Like most Marvel characters, she's always one punch away from a huge explosion.  Spideies are supposed to be more like Batman or Superman.  Even the first Spider-MAN, which I loved, took a while to get started. It took a very long time before Spidee Peter Parker started using his powers.  So there are a lot of things about the Gwens that I didn''t like about the movie.  But then again, for every bad thing that the film has, there are plenty of positives
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say I love this movie a lot! I was amazed by its characters and the fact that the director really took a chance in showing this kind of movie that a lot of people like! Even though this movie was created by a man and a woman (it's like a real romantic movie in my eyes) I felt so much sympathy for them! If you're a fan of this kind an interesting story, funny and quite a few interesting plot points, you should really check this movie out!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film about a man who's in love with a woman but his past and the present doesn't allow it and he is about to lose her when he meets the girl of his dreams: a girl who has a crush on a guy she met in a bar. They meet and everything goes well until they get to know each other more and more and the guy starts to fall in love and the girl doesn't know how to react or what to do.   There are lots of twists and turns in this film and while the story isn't amazing it does an excellent job of showing you the life of a guy and how the world affects his life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason I'm posting this review is because I watched this movie in order to write about it. I saw it again this morning and I don't even want to talk about it anymore.   It has a bit of a different feel to it, but I can't say I really disliked it.  It's a bit too long for it to be a stand alone, but there's enough of it that it's worth watching all the way through, even though it is really long.  I also liked the way it was shot.  My wife really liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There have been a few times when I have felt a bit sad about the world we live in. A world where there is no justice in the form of the law and only a few people are saved from hell, hell where it is said "the devil can make any man do anything". What a world. Well, what a life that's been lived! The movie is based on the fact that I believe that this was the first major Hollywood movie that I was able to enjoy, to enjoy the story, the characters, the performances, to think they are real people who are just trying to live their lives in this strange and horrible world. I liked the movie.   I give it a 9/10 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am in no way a "film buff". But I am a huge fan of the movie.   So the movie was about a "bad" movie-goer who is getting his life-blood sucked out of him...until he gets involved in an unlikely "hero" (who was in fact an "un-hero") plot...I guess? The plot is not all that original. But it is well done.  The movie has a lot of funny dialog, and a strong, emotional ending.  This movie is so over the top, that it is hard for me to find a flaw... I mean, the "bad guy" has the power to make people love him...so he has to use that "power"...until the end...and he is a good "hero"...and I liked him and like the movie...and I would like to see a second one...  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this movie to watch in the theater with my friends and they were really impressed by the movie. My only complaint is the poor sound in the movie so the movies sound effects don't match the movie itself. If your a lover of horror movies this movie is worth a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I heard of this movie was the DVD released in the 80's. It was a really good movie. I am a huge fan of the Star Trek universe, and the show is so much fun. So when I heard about this new movie coming out, I had to see it. It certainly had a few problems, but it was still a fun watch. I loved this movie, and you would definitely enjoy it, too. I have never seen the original series of Star Trek, so I am not an expert on the show, but I knew that when I saw this movie that it would be a very good movie, at least I thought it would, I wasn't disappointed.    Helpful and very entertaining. I'm not sure I was expecting this one to be as good as it was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be excellent.   The story is amazing, and the story of a boy who becomes a vampire after being attacked by an evil being is really fascinating.  The acting was superb.  I believe this was the first time I was able to appreciate Michael Gough in a role.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dumb and Dumber To (1980)" is a good sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made.   The comedy and comedy are back in full force and the writing is fantastic.  " Dumber" Jim Carrey and Jim Belushi are funny as ever and the plot keeps things interesting all the way through.  The story was told in a manner that kept a lot of scenes and characters coming back up over and over again.

There are some good characters like the Jawas and Chewbacca, and the action scenes are very intense and exciting.  It's a good time for sci-fi fans.    The first Star Wars was also good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was great!   I loved how we got to watch our heroes live out the ultimate dream in a place they never would have imagined. I especially liked the fact that we got a second chance at their life which they took before.   As we got more and more of our heroes into the movie we also got to see them grow more in a sense, for some of them we saw that they were truly badasses and for others they got to get a little bit of their power back. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never thought I'd see this film but I decided to watch it. It's a beautiful film. I think most people can look past the fact that the lead actor, Tom Hanks, was a drunk when making the movie, but the film as a whole is an incredible piece of filmmaking. It shows how far a person can get in this life. I've always wanted to live the life of a Hollywood actor so it's nice to see it played out on a stage. I'm glad I saw this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a nice movie, it's not very good, but it's nice to see them doing the things they do (they did it in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home ) so well.    This is a great sci-fi flick with a good story that should not be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My son and I sat in the car. I put my hand in his lap and took a nap. He sat up and said, "We are a family of two now. I want to spend more time with you." That was all we had left of our day. We had fun while playing a little ball and he liked when I played with my cat, Kitty. The best part of the day was when my sister wanted a ride home. I asked my son what he wanted. "I want to ride my bicycle," he said. Then I told him he could go on a bicycle trip. "But Daddy," he asked, "who's your bicycle?" "I bought it for you," I replied.   I was born in England to a mother who came from a small village in East Anglia. I attended school in Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk. I lived with my mother in a very small, rented house. I worked in the cotton mills at Bury.  I think the best thing about this movie is that it is not too serious about being a family. I didn't see it for a long time after I saw it. I was always interested in my father. He has an interesting and deep love for his dog, who he always took with him on a visit home. He loved the dog a lot. In fact he could get very emotional about it. He also liked my cat Kitty a lot and would talk to her about his son. He never missed the chance to touch her and play with her. My favorite moment with my father is when he gives my sister a new kitten. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An underrated movie, not as popular as its predecessor, the first one was not that great, but this one is amazing.   I think it is an excellent film with a decent plot, some great visuals and a story that is full of meaning.  I wish they would make a sequel, this film is too good not to make a trilogy.  This is a must watch movie for a great action/adventure story!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of movies with a dark and gritty atmosphere. This movie does exactly that and it is not that hard to get into because the main protagonist is a nice character who is a victim of his situation and it's up to you to help him out or be a hero and save him.   The story is told from the perspective of a young girl who has been turned into a vampire in a world of darkness and evil that her brother and best friend are also infected. The whole movie is told in the first person which makes it easy to understand the characters, but not so easy to follow.  In the beginning you feel sorry for these guys and there is a very eerie feel to the movie from the start to the end, which can be compared to something of the supernatural and of course the film does not miss the chance to remind us of the evils in the world.  This is a great vampire movie for fans of vampires and horror and for those of you who are looking for a good horror movie this is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has all the hallmarks of a classic. You are given a good premise with a very unique story. It starts with a simple girl who starts a band with her best friends and one day the band gets caught up in a robbery. The band members go to jail and she makes a very interesting confession to the cop who interrogated her. The film is mostly focused on her confession but there is also a great twist. The music is good, the film is good and it's good for a laugh.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of horror movies. This is the second one of these movies that I have watched. The first one was called 'The Nightmare' and the first movie I saw of this is in a theater at the same time in the same city. This was a film made with the same kind of themes. But this movie had a more realistic and realistic portrayal of what happens when a killer is stalking a little girl. The film had some wonderful scenes in the park at night with the little girl running down the path at night and there was a killer stalking her. The killer was a little old man in a white dress and was really creepy. This guy was really scary and the little girls reaction to him is very realistic. The scene with the girl sitting in a chair in a room is the best scene I've seen in a film. I'm sure that if the little boy didn't look down so much when he heard the little screams it would not be the same. I also watched the documentary about this movie which is about the people who live in the town and what they think of this movie. The girl that is haunted by this killer is a teacher in the school where the killer is supposed to work. The little boy who watches the killer stalking the girl is a kid that is playing on the steps of the school and the girl that he is watching has a friend that lives in the area. I hope the killer who stalked the little kids name is ever found.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen a few of the films by Steven Spielberg in the past, and I haven't liked them much, but this one is a definite keeper.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not quite the masterpieces of art cinema that we were used to seeing in the 80s and 90s, but I found the movie quite enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In order to have a true love story, which also had a good plot, it was difficult to imagine the development of this love story until I saw it. But the love story was quite good. The two leads were in the best form of the actors they were, especially the main lead. The cinematography was pretty good, the actors were very good.   As far as the plot goes, it is an improvement on the previous films. I think the writer and director was more inspired in this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a bit like a combination of "The Deer Hunter" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark."   The plot of the story follows a couple (one of the two leads is a man in drag) on a vacation at a local summer camp.   After the couple has been to the camp the woman goes to a party at a nearby resort.  In this party she gets into a discussion with a man (played by Michael Biehn) and his son (played, hilariously, by a woman). The two men argue about the nature of the Universe and the life and the death of a woman. The wife, played by Shelley Winters, then gets into an argument with the wife of the man whose wife she just got in a fight with.  It's kind of hard to believe that this movie was shot in 1959.  This movie is a lot like "The Beaver." It's about a woman who takes her two young children (aged about 7 and 8) with her to a summer camp and then is murdered by her husband in drag.  The only difference is that this story is about a murder, and not a rape.  There are many scenes in this movie which are so realistic.  At the beginning of the film we see that the two kids were left alone by their mother, and that it seems like they are not going to make it out of the camp alive. The woman is so sick (literally, not figuratively) that she doesn't even want to go out to the party. At one point, while looking for food to put in her belly, she comes across a bag of candy. After eating it, she gets up and goes into the bathroom, but not before asking the wife to bring her some more food.  We see the whole family as they sit around a table drinking and talking, then after the man eats his dinner a woman walks up and asks him if she should take a bath.  Now we get to the murder.  When we first meet the woman, she is already dead.  Then, after the murder, her son is left in a bathtub and when he opens the door a little later, he finds his mother's body.  What's more, when we see the corpse, the head of the victim, in a white gown, is hanging upside down.  After all this, the woman is buried in the backyard, and the son (who just happens to be a cop
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you don't have any experience with horror movies, do yourself a favor and do not check out this movie.     The movie is based on a true story about a group of people who live on the outskirts of a small town in Iowa called Des Moines. One night they are invited by a friend of a friend to a house party. What they do not expect is a horrifying surprise when they get into the house and find out what is going on inside.  It's quite a good read.  It gets a little scary at times but overall is a fun, exciting movie that has a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a young woman who finds a lost boy and brings him home.   I like the first part of the movie a lot. I like how they found the missing boy and that it was done with humor and charm.  I liked the first half the most.  It was funny, moving and a good time for a family to watch.  The rest of the film is good but a little slow.  My brother liked the second half a lot more.  A little better acting and more action in the second part.  As far as the movie goes, I liked it but it was a little too long for my liking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a whole, this movie was great. I loved the fact that all of the heroes had the same thing in common - to survive in the wild. As far as I was concerned, they all were pretty much perfect and it was really fun to watch them get to know each other and have some fun time in the world. I do wish that the movie had gone a little bit further on a few of the characters and not just made them into villains. This would have been better. I really like this movie and would recommend it to people who love a good western. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I saw it I had no idea what I was getting into. A boy named Kevin (Ben Mendelsohn) has a big crush on a girl named Karen (Amy Adams). When Karen's mom (Joan Allen) comes to town and Kevin sees a new television show, the one he loves the most, he thinks he's in love. And when Karen turns out to be a girl, a lot of her emotions start to shift into a boy's voice (or is it a girl's voice?). So, Kevin takes Karen out for a date to his friend's (Tommy Lee Jones) house. While there he has to deal with the whole thing being played by his parents (a girl and a boy) with the help of his friend (Dennis Quaid). The movie really has a good balance of comedy and drama. The main issue is that I found the movie was too long. The ending was a little contrived (but I was happy it happened). However, it would be nice if some of the songs used were a little more unique. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I said, it was very interesting and enjoyable. It reminded me of an old movie about a guy who's mother died from a disease and he was really depressed. Well, one day he got a new girlfriend and he said his name was Steve (but everyone called him Steve). Then he was called by his mother's name of Rose and she said to him: "I love you". Well, he's really in love with her and at the end, he got what he wanted.   But it's not the main idea of this movie, it's more about Steve and the girlfriend. Steve doesn't care about his job, he just wants to spend time with his girlfriend. He can do it because he was taught how to handle computers by his parents and his girlfriend helped him a lot. And this movie has really good editing and great music, this is one of those great movies where the plot is simple and the pace is perfect.  Posted by Nothin' at 8:23 AM

They also find out about a town that seems to be just like the one they are in but a little better since it seems to have a priest that is the mayor and he seems to know a lot about the town and how to clean up the place. So they head down into San Fierero to try to get rid of them.

The plot of this great movie is a really great one. I would like to have seen it from the beginning because it is not an easy movie to watch. The scenes with the war machine is very well-done and you really get the feeling when the machine is coming. The movie has a great soundtrack and very good acting from all the cast. But the movie is not really about the characters of the movie but about the world in which we live. The characters were all great and made the story exciting. I like this movie and I think it will be a classic. I liked it very much.

But this movie is really good, there's a great script and it's a lot of fun to watch. It is good to see the characters again, even if they aren't the same, because the chemistry between them is so good it's hard to believe that the actors aren't old enough to legally drink. I especially like the way that the director treats the boys and the movie's pacing. I also like the music and the score is awesome, it makes it look like a lot more than it really is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (I'm not going to lie. This movie's pretty damn good.)   It's a buddy-cop movie with a twist. The twist is that the buddy-cops are actually the bad guys.   The plot is basically the story of a woman (played by Mary Jo Pehl) who's trying to find out why her boyfriend (played, appropriately enough, by Joe Pantoliano) has been killed in a car crash.  The police have been looking for the guy who took the victim's car and it turns out that this is a guy who has been stalking the victim all along.  He's an asshole and he hates women.  However, he's also a great-hearted person who cares about his friends.  When the police try to force him to confess to the killing he doesn't want to talk and doesn't know where the car is so he's a bit evasive and kind of crazy. He does confess, of course, but only after his first victim is murdered.  Meanwhile, the bad guy is out there doing his best to murder these good guys. After the first guy is killed a new group of friends is put together to go after this guy and his gang.  It all seems like a fairly straightforward cop movie.  For a couple of minutes, the characters even try to set up a date and the buddy cops seem to like him.  But as soon as the new guy is put in the team, it seems like the buddy cop guys aren't really interested in him. He's not a good enough guy and they're not willing to give him a chance to prove himself. The police eventually track down the bad-guy but can't track him down as quickly as the good guy's gang. So they decide to kill him and let the badguy go free.  Then they find out that the bad Guy isn't going to go down without a fight.  This turns out to be a very good thing.  In the final scene, one of the good guys gets killed and one of those bad guys decides that he needs to show those cops that he's the best guy out there.  I really like that the good buddies were put together so that they could take the fight to this guy.  There was no way they were going to be able to do anything against the badie, especially since he seems to have a bunch of allies.  Instead, the good friends realized they needed to work together

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so happy when I heard this movie. I heard about it by listening to a talk by a friend of mine named Ray. I had to see it! When I saw the trailer for this movie, I loved it. The characters were so good. They were all such sweet and caring, happy and carefree people. This movie was well done and really happy. I would say that if you like movies with happy happy people, then this movie is for you. I didn't understand what was so great about the movie at first. It seemed to be just like the trailer said it would be. When I watched it a second time, I finally understood it. This is a great movie for all ages.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a lot of movies, but this is one of my favourites. The characters are real and complex, and the story is quite well paced.   The director, James Gray, is a wonderful storyteller. It's been several years since his last film, and his new work is just as good as any of his earlier work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the movie?   It's fun as hell, it's cute as all heck, it has heart and it has a pretty good plot.   I do wish that it had a little more time for characters but the fun they have is great.  I'm in love with this movie from start to finish. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great thriller. I don't usually like thriller movies but this one has a real "heart-wrenching" ending! I wish I could have been there to see this as it was the night before I had just turned 21 and I was really hoping I would get a job that paid a lot and was very exciting. I got the part to play my friend and a "good" guy. I went to this place to play the piano and I didn't even think I'd end up getting killed by a guy I was in love with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a good mix of humour and tragedy in this film. The plot has a beginning, middle, and end. But all the parts are done in such a way that you feel there is a larger picture behind each event.   And I mean big. One of the best scenes in this movie is when a small girl with a white ribbon in her hair and a flower in her hand walks into the shop with a letter for her sister (the little girl's name is Rose, and she is a very small girl, I mean very small. She's not very bright at all, and her father is an ugly old man who is always trying to do bad things with her. But she loves him, and so she plays with his money and his car and his toys).   The movie also has some very good animation, and the special effects are very good as well. The characters are well thought out, the dialogue is all in French, and although the animation may be a little bit hard to follow it all works well and fits the mood very well.  This film is really well made, and I recommend it to anyone who has a soft spot for little girls. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A young man and woman meet at the local diner and decide to drive across the country together to a new life in a remote area.   The movie starts with a woman who is afraid to get out of bed as the only sound is a nearby waterfall.  The sounds of the rain and the waterfall are disturbing and the woman is terrified to go back to the house, but she decides to go anyway.  When the car comes to a complete stop she climbs out of the window, grabs a coat and climbs into a car with a man she meets.  They drive around and do a bunch of things and she takes him to a place she describes as a "vaguely attractive old lady".  The car is a dark gray old car with an old woman inside.  He goes in after the woman and finds the room is dark and scary.  At the end of the movie there is a scary scene involving the old woman.  I felt that the movie had some good elements.  It was funny and sad, a good idea for a summer movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think we've all been to a horror movie and had our hearts broken.   In this movie, we learn that there's more to the woods than meets the eye, and that there are many more than just the evil clown.  The story was a little slow to start but when we learn about this clown and his plans, I felt so bad for the poor guy, but not like I was going to have to sit around and cry over a guy who wasn't very likable.  It was a good story, though, and I felt sorry for all the people who had to go through the horrors he inflicted.  I will definitely watch the second part in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is good and it will certainly not be a bad one, it might be better than the original, but it still lacks something.

The story is well written, it did have a little too much action, but that is to be expected when the hero has to save the world from an alien invasion.  The action scenes were all well choreographed, and even the more comedic scenes are fun to watch.  If you are a fan of comedy, sci fi, action, and action scenes, then this is a good pick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm going to tell you the story of how I first saw this movie.   It was a Saturday night.  A couple of us were walking back to our dorm from a movie. I didn't really get the movie. It was one of those "one-dimensional" movies you see in college dorms.  What I saw in it were a couple of very bad characters and one very good character.  It is actually hard to give the movie a high rating since it's just a story about a couple who break up.  However, it has a good plot and a good script.  The writing is so bad that at times I had to stop it and read the subtitles to make it out.  But there were many interesting things in it.  Some of it I found interesting (like the characters).  It also has a nice song in it at one point.  And I liked the special effects.  I think it's too bad they did this without a director since it was way too bad to be good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... If you like horror, this movie is worth seeing. I thought it was scary at times but also had some good laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty good. The special effects are pretty good and they are really made up for the low budget, and I mean that quite literally, so they work out really well. The story is pretty interesting and I didn't understand it at first. I thought I knew what was going on, but I didn�t. I found myself a bit lost on what exactly was going to happen, but the ending is pretty cool. I am not sure I would have gone see this movie again, but it is still worth a watch if you�re looking for a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good family movie, with a good message, a funny scene (where a drunk dad is taken to the local "nursery"), and great music.   The movie doesn't come across as "family friendly" until there are about ten of the kids at home (two are too young to drive but they can take the bus, and the other nine are able to walk).   There is a great scene at the end when the kids play football.   Rated 5 out of 5   In this film "The Three Little Pigs" is based on a fairy tale (which we know from the Bible). The story is very simple, but a good one for children.  Rating: 1.5 stars from me

Write a positive review about a good movie:   .I had high hopes for this movie. This is the story of an American boy named Billy (Aaron Eckhart), who is born to a poor family with a large inheritance. He lives with his mother and his sister who runs a little café in a little country town. One day he encounters an old man (Billy's father) and takes a picture of him and shows it to his sister. They are taken aback and angry at Billy for doing such a thing. Soon after, Billy's father disappears and the family goes into hiding. They have a hard time on the streets of the town and are often hungry and miserable. They try and hide and avoid authorities, but to no avail. Their situation is hopeless. Billy's sister has to give up her cafe and take up work in a nearby factory. The only way they can keep from going hungry is by stealing to eat. Billy discovers a new type of apple called an apple. It grows slowly over the course of a year and has a wonderful flavor. The Apple becomes a source of food for the family. They begin to think more and more about what will become of the apple and their future. As this story was told to me it sounded like something out of a novel, although I'm not a great fan of novels. It was a very well written story. I couldn't help but think about the people I knew in my childhood, people who were more or less like myself. The author used the apple as a metaphor for the future. The way that the apple works is that, by stealing a few apples and planting them, it grows over the long term and becomes a small country. The apple is now a symbol of their new life. The characters were well written. Aaron Eckhart was a strong and interesting lead, the others all seemed to be real people with their own problems.   I liked it so much, that I can't wait to read more of this wonderful story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The film is a work of art." - James McKeever, San Francisco Chronicle, March 25, 1997
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, it's the "American Pie" of the summer and there are a few problems: 1. The story: The story is not that interesting. The premise is the perfect mix between a kid's movie and a comedy; and, at times, it is. But, what I found to be a bit strange was the ending. It's a movie where everyone ends up being the butt of the joke, and I found it a little bit lame. 2. The performances: It's funny how even though everyone is in the same situation, they play it like the kids are having a good time. The jokes get funnier and funnier, and the "heroes" keep getting the worst ending possible. If you think you would laugh, you will, and if you don't laugh, then you probably won't. It just does not work. Also, I felt a little sorry for the kid who had to play the piano all day and the girl who is always trying to be perfect in everything. 3. The ending: This ending, while being the best I've ever seen, still just did not make sense to me.   4. The cast: In my opinion, the only thing worse than the writing is the acting. Some of the best actors are not in the movie. The best character is the dumb kid, and while his acting is good, he just does too much.  5. Overall:  While this movie has its moments, it doesn't make it. The movie is a bit predictable and does not do what it is supposed to do. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you liked A Clockwork Orange or The Wicker Man, you will probably like this film.  The plot is fairly simple, but the story is very good. The main character has some pretty bad luck and is almost thrown in jail when he's supposed to work the front of a store for a while.  This is a very well written film, but I was surprised that it didn't work out the way the characters thought it would.   I found it very disturbing, and also a very sad film, which I liked.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a good old-fashioned Western, with some action and some humor. This is an interesting film, with a great script, but sometimes it takes a few moments to get going. The action scenes are really good, though I never liked them when they were done by a non-Western actor, and the movie's comedy is a bit too clever for my taste. The film has some really good action scenes (there are two real gunfights) and, once again, the dialogue is really good. If you like to see an old-style Western done really well and are interested in watching an all-star cast, then this is a good Western to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the new Spider-Man!   It has all the right ingredients to make a successful reboot.   The story is simple and the characters are likable.  The new Spider Man is very funny and it has some great action sequences.  Spider-man also has a great deal of depth and is easily one of the most complex Marvel heroes.  It's good to see the web slinger being the team leader.  All in all Spider- mans new origin is not as good as the original and as a result the character has changed and is more complex.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not sure if I agree with the reviewer who says: "One of the very few 'bad guys' who is actually good." I disagree. If this was the first movie that the "Good Guys" were going to do, they're on pretty good luck.   This movie does not make a whole lot of sense from a philosophical standpoint, and I suspect that's intentional.  It's like watching a movie of a movie with the music on, and in order to understand the movie, one must put it to sleep.  But I enjoyed this movie because it's an enjoyable ride. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an excellent film with a great story to tell.   The story is simple: The planet is on the brink of extinction. An alliance of aliens (alien-mice?) have been brought to earth to stop the earth's destruction. They can't do this. The Earth's oceans are being poisoned by their own kind. Their leader, Professor Prozor, wants to stop them. But they are too much for him to handle.  To defeat them Prozors team is going to the moon, but they need a lot of money to get there. They also need to find a powerful weapon.  The movie is good. You can see some of the best movie monsters. You have to love them.  They have to be a lot more powerful than they are in this movie.  There is so much energy and so many of them in there.  At one point a lot has changed in the movie. The film has to be seen to believe it.  It is not just a movie. It is a work of art.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Dollhouse" is an absolutely excellent movie.   If you enjoy the horror, humor and good writing of Richard Matheson and John Boorman then you will love this movie. The dollhouse set looks like a real doll house with a wooden floor. There is a piano and a few chairs and a couple of beds. There are lots of dolls, dolls with legs, dolls that walk like a human, a doll who can hear, doll that can hear anything and a doll that looks like some kind of monster or alien.  The special effects were amazing.  This movie was made for adults, kids and kids who like a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, let's be honest here:  This is not a great movie.  Sure, it has some very good action scenes, but the whole plot of the movie is nothing but a poorly designed comedy.  When the story begins, a woman named Evelyn (Lois Smith) is sent on a mission to kill a serial killer by a former mob boss called Billy (Paul Sorvino) who is now on the run from the police.  Evelyn and Billy then meet up with a man called Don (Robert Blake) who has a very peculiar past and whose body parts are displayed for sale in the museum of oddities.  This bizarre museum has the worst of the worst and, most importantly, is the place Evelyn's mission to find Billy ends up.  The film is filled with all sorts of bad jokes that don't work because they are poorly acted and made even worse by the script (the best part of the film).  The only time the film works is when Evelyn goes to the museum to check out Don's body, which is also displayed in a way that is meant to make the film more interesting.   The final scene of the entire movie is made even more pointless by the fact that the film is meant as a parody of its own genre and, in that respect, the whole thing seems silly.  A man could at least make the jokes work.  It's a pretty good film, but a very bad movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really not expecting to like this one, not being a huge fan of either the original trilogy or this second one. I thought it would just be some sort of weird, low budget action movie with a really old-fashioned sense of style and some really ridiculous gore, but no. This movie is just an interesting look at the life and times of a gangster, but it's so much more than that. The acting is great in the sense that they play it all really good, and the acting is just so much better than the last movie. The story is also much better and the whole movie is so much funnier than anything else. I don't have to explain myself on how amazing the movie is, you should all try it out yourselves. I think this will really set a good precedent for future movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second film in the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series, "Dinner Party" stars the film's young hero, the same boy who once threw a rock in a movie theatre. A friend from school, a kid who never went to see the movie, makes a party with him and his friends. They're in town to go shopping for groceries, and they have a little trouble at a store (don't judge, it was supposed to be in downtown) where the owner, Mr. Murch (the same character from the original film), is a bit of a jerk. He is kind of scary, too, and the kids go to look at the movie he was showing and he has a terrible dream about the movie which he then makes them watch. When the kids leave, Murch has them stay a night and do a movie. The kids are not happy about it and start to get upset about the food they're going to eat, so Murch sends them back to the motel.   In the morning, the kids are in their pajamas and all sorts of mischief is going on. When they return to the hotel room, Marge is in a good mood and shows them the movie (in which the townspeople have a really good time). At the end of the movie they go back to Murch's room, and he tells them they can have pizza from the pizzeria that he likes to visit. The first thing Murch does when they get there is show the kids the movie again, and then he has them have some pizza. Marge's enthusiasm for having pizza at every opportunity is infectious, and she starts to become very affectionate with the kids.  They are not too thrilled to be there, though, so when he gets up the girls say they have to go. Moved by Marge, they all run to the bathroom. When he gets back, he tells the kids that they can't go into the movie theatre anymore. They have to wait until morning. Munching away on his pizza, he goes to bed.  After Marge goes to sleep, the girls, now in their evening gowns and braids, walk into the room and they're all excited to see what's coming next.  But when they come into the theatre, they see the pizza is not there. They all run around the room, upset about what happened, until they find the pizzas and they see

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an old movie that is still entertaining and very well made.   When I heard the trailer for this I thought it was a remake of a movie I loved as a child.  But, I saw it after watching this movie and it is a new movie with a new ending.  I like how it was shot with lots of special effects.  And I like the cast and how they acted.  Like I said before the ending was very satisfying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw the trailer, I thought this movie was a comedy with a serious message. I can see how it was made and why it was received this way. I think it was a bit more "serious" than I would like, but still an enjoyable movie. The dialogue was funny, the music was good, the story was about as well told as any of the "movies about the paranormal" I've seen.   I watched this with my son. He doesn't laugh at all, so it's perfect for him.  The ending was very abrupt. It was probably the most abrupt ending I've ever seen in a movie and it was abrupt. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many other films out today, The Devil's Backbone tells a darkly comic tale of a young girl's obsession with a devil-spawned child. The movie is full of funny, sometimes shocking scenes and the young girl, Mary, spends a lot of time trying to talk her way into the care of the devil, even threatening to strangle herself and her mother. But, in the end, Mary gets what she came for: the devil gives her a heart that can survive the horrors of hell. She decides to go along with his wishes, but, even so, she has to make the best of a terrible situation. And, of course, the Devil is no angel.   The Devil may not be quite as powerful as his name might suggest. He's not quite as cool. The characters are no more angelic than the demons they encounter on their way to the girl's home. And the story does suffer a little from too much emphasis on Mary's fear of the Devil. But it's a good idea for a movie. The Devil is in it a lot, even if it is hard to see, and when he appears, it's always the most surprising thing in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all I should warn you that I'm a fan of both this movie and the books by Robert E Howard.  I loved this movie from the moment I saw it.  There is nothing better in the whole movie world than a good old fashioned monster movie.  The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the movie felt more like a horror film than a Monster movie. It wasn't that the monster was scary or scary in an unpleasant way, but it was just a nice, slow build-up and payoff to the entire movie, and it felt more the plot of a classic horror story than an actual horror film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       "This movie, I believe is a very important movie in the history of American movies, because of the fact that it's so successful.  It's a very good comedy, with a very big idea, and very good actors.  I think this is the second time I've seen a comedy from the first generation of film directors.   One of the directors, Stanley Kubrick, is very close to Spielberg.  We've had a couple of very good movies recently, like ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' and ''Jaws,'' which were really funny, but not very good in the sense of quality.  This is a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original version of The Rocketeer   is a much more fun movie than it first appears. This version makes fun of science fiction for not being much of a fun movie. And that's right: it's all about the fun, and the Rocketeers are a bunch of goofballs who go to space to fight bad guys who, if you're reading this, aren't that bad. (The one bad guy is the bad guy in the original film, who is supposed to be bad but is not bad at all.) The good guys (of which there are at least five) get a crash course in the basics of rocketry. You're supposed to have them practice a few times before they're sent up to battle the bad guys, but the baddies show up in the space fortress and they are not the easiest of friends. At one point the baddie has to be restrained from being shot because he's throwing up. It's a pretty uneventful, forgettable space adventure, but it's fun. And when the bads get into space, they do it all wrong. The Rocketyourever is a large and ugly ship, but you do not have to climb up to it to get a good view. There are no giant screens and everything is just a large piece of plastic on top of a big screen. They put a lot of effort into making it look pretty (especially in the back-up movie) but it takes more effort than it's worth. The main bad guy has a little spaceship that he uses to try to attack the Rocketyrever, but he's pretty slow. When you're fighting some bad guys on top a space fortress in a spaceship, you're not going to be able to move fast.   But it's not a bad film.  A nice scene:  The Rocketryeer   gets the title from the fact that they're a space-rocketeer. You get a glimpse of that on a screen above the Rocketeer, but other than that the Rocketryeers are just regular kids. They're in junior high and the leader is a big, bad-boy named Sam Rocketeier (William Shatner), whose best friend is a tiny, scrawny nerd named Eddie (Jeffrey Combs). In the movie you see them fighting all kinds of bad guys and goofing off, as if to say, this is what it's like to be a

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had high hopes for this movie as a result of the trailer, which, at least in terms of its originality, I had never seen before. I hadn't seen a movie in a while, and so I decided to try and see a movie that I had not seen for a long time, something that was so different that I wasn't sure what to expect.   It had some great ideas.  There was a great performance by David Alan Grier in the lead role.  They had a very interesting plot, and they played it very well, but I think the film did have a couple of problems.  Firstly, it did feel like a very dated story.  It seemed like a typical western with a little sci fi thrown in.  I also felt that the characters were not well rounded enough, and had a couple that did not seem as good as the rest of them.  And the end of the movie did not have quite enough of a conclusion, so it could have been a little more satisfying.  For an action movie with some interesting ideas about a modern world that has gone to shit, the film was a little lacking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky enough to watch this in a group of us who loved the movie "The Big Lebowski".  It is my personal favorite movie.  It has the "greatest one liners" ever.  I love it!   My brother in law who loved this movie gave me a hard time and made me put it away.  He has not been to my place in 15 years.   It was a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about this movie I was hoping to see a horror movie with a little twist that is not the typical jump scare but one that leaves you with a good laugh and a few laughs along the way. The story was interesting and scary at times, especially if you are a fan of the Saw series of films.   The film itself has a little bit of everything and as long as you watch the first few minutes and don't let it get to you it is a solid horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie had a very cool concept: You would get to be a little girl who is a witch. You would be in a witch-cave, being watched by some witches. You can hear them laughing behind the scenes and you would think that they are being very silly. However, they are not. The first half of the movie was great, the witches were funny, and the ending was very sweet. It is not as funny as in the book, but it's still a lot of fun.

The movie begins with a little guy named Billy and his dog in the forest trying to survive.  It sounds kind of sad but this movie makes it real.  And they do have a lot of things to eat.  The first movie is really cute and the second movie is just as good.  You don't need a lot to be good and this is a great movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot, but it had a lot of plot holes.   There was a lot more to be said about this movie than what I said, but here are my thoughts:  The first half of the movie is excellent! It was set in the 60's, it was very realistic, it featured an interesting cast, and a couple of interesting scenes that I won't spoil. It's a little cliche, but is pretty great.  It does start off with a twist, but in reality, it's a story about an alien and a man, who is dying, and the man is a genius scientist.  The aliens are very evil, and it is clear they don't care if humans live or die.  In the second half of this movie, you see the aliens take over the Earth, and I liked that they did. The main character has to fight them, and he is amazing in the fight. It was pretty easy to follow, and you got to see some great fighting scenes!   In this movie is a very good, fun action movie that I wish I had watched when I was younger.

The movie is about a man whose entire world collapses. His wife (Kim Basinger) leaves him, his kids don't care for him, and the neighbors get angry at him. After he can't eat, he has no more energy. The world is his problem.   A good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good comedy. I liked the idea that the film's plot centers around an art-house movie star-turned-politician-turned politician who decides to leave his wife and kids behind in order to help a sick child in need, with a cameo from the very charming John Cleese.   There's something about a guy playing the piano that makes you laugh, or maybe it's the way Cleese manages to play an actual instrument with a straight face.  -  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film takes place in a small town where a guy who looks like a cross between a vampire and a zombie shows up. When he asks if anyone is home, it is all dark. After a few seconds, he is revealed to be a zombie. He then proceeds to eat the rest of the villagers and takes everyone to hell.   This is actually a fun horror film and the movie has some good jokes. I do like the idea that there are people who look like zombies and we get to see them in action. I also like how the "zombie" actually shows his feelings towards being eaten and wants to go to hell and return to life.

I love the original trilogy and it's just a nice movie, but when I saw a remake with the same name and plot I didn't feel like it was any better, maybe the actors and director did their best to make it better, but I didn' t really like it.

Then when I saw a bunch of people dressed in black go into the woods to hunt and this thing just happened it was so freaky I can't believe they didn't just call it Night of the Living Dead, it looked and sounded so scary and they had to do this dance routine to get around and the song was creepy as hell and it was just like something from a bad 80's movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last time I was in California was in 1992. I had only recently moved in with my husband, Chris. It was a big decision, and one that I did not take lightly. I knew that he did not want me to move here, and I did too. I would rather be anywhere else. It seemed like everyone had just moved to California, which I thought was a good thing. There was no need for the entire world to be moving into a one-of-a-kind lifestyle. But I was wrong. The state of California is a great place to live.   I thought that my husband had a little more experience than the average Joe on the streets of his hometown. I am so glad that I finally moved here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "They call him the 'Big Show' When I was younger, I was a big fan of professional wrestling and especially the World Wrestling Federation. As a child, the WWF had a tremendous amount of violence and intrigue, and I wanted to see it. When the WWF switched its television programming from live to taped wrestling shows, I missed live wrestling so much. After that, I tried to find out what was happening in the wrestling ring. It was then that I found out about WWF's 'Friday Night Fights' and the 'Monday Night War' (which was a war between WWF and the World Wildlife Fund) and the idea of a weekly wrestling show. As I grew up, I wanted more wrestling and more WWF, and 'Friday Nights Fights" was a way to get it. The WWF began airing these Friday nights on the local station in my area. This was a time when, just as I was finding out what TV was all about, cable television came along and all other local stations were being replaced by cable. I was so glad that, like the big-box video stores of that era, I could get WWF on the big screen, and as I grew older, I still would watch it. I also found out that some of the WWF's stars were really big stars in the ring. I always thought it was nice that when WWF was on, the audience got to see big guys like Hulk Hogan, Mr. Perfect, and Terry Funk as they were working their way through the ranks. I had seen the WWF in its prime. The ratings were good and they brought back the old stars that many people still remember. The shows were great and I think that this period is one of the reasons why wrestling is in such good condition today. "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this is the movie that everybody who's been reading the book has been waiting for. I am not going to say that I loved the book, because I don't. I didn't really like it, I'm not sure I would have even been able to finish it, had I gone to read the book in the first place. I guess it could have been worse, but this isn't the best book in that series, which is a real shame. But the book is about what you would expect a book about a group of people in England to be about: a group with different goals. This movie, on the other hand, focuses on the main characters, a group that seems to be made up of every person that's ever had a bad day: the people who are unemployed, the people without a job, the young people trying to find themselves, the old people looking for love, the parents looking for their lost children, the children wanting to know why their father is in prison, the father looking for his daughter. And in a good way, of course. The cast is great, even if they are only the actors. I don.t know how to rate the acting of the actors, as I didn;t really care for anyone. Not that I didn t like any of them much at all, but I don;t know where they were supposed to be. All I can say is that the director managed to make us feel as though we knew them as people even when we only met them for the first time. The music is great too, even though most of it was just background noise. The best thing about this movie is the characters. They are all very interesting, and you feel they are all real people. And they have real problems. I thought it was a shame that the main character, a woman who can't find a job or is trying to get a job but is too ashamed to even attempt it, was cut out of the movie because of the sex scene. I mean, if you are going to cut it out you have to cut every sex scene out. And the film is mostly about the relationships of the characters, which isn't really my thing. But maybe that's because I'm an adult. I loved all of the relationships that the characters had, and I'm glad that this movie got made. But I'm still not sure if I'll be making a trip to England for this movie.

This movie has a certain charm about it which I don't think that I have ever seen before, but that doesn't mean that I didn  I loved it, and I didn`t hate it. What I did find a little odd was the fact that it`s always a guy from the other guy`s neighborhood. It seemed odd.  That's a little strange.  in terms of acting, there wasn`t anything special in it. I liked the character of David the most, but the way he did things and the way the characters did things was quite peculiar. 's not the most subtle film about a family, but it`t a bad movie at all. It`s just not the movie I expected to see.     But I did like it.       So, what I liked about it was the small-town feel and the lack of dialogue. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a good time watching this movie.   The movie is called "Dune" and it is based on a book by Frank Herbert called "The Dune Chronicles".   You could say the book is just a novel about a young woman who gets lost on a desert planet and ends up falling in love with a dune buggy driver named Paul Atreides.  The plot of this movie is good.  It tells the story about how the "Great Father" and his wife Queen Alia and their two daughters make a living off the planet.  But the planet is dying and there are only two daughters left to live on.  One is Alia Atreids daughter.  Paul and Queen Alias son.  They want to sell their ship so they can come down to earth and live here.  Atrei's wife Alia is a brilliant woman who is so clever that she makes the whole planet seem like a child's play.  In addition she is not married and she is constantly making love to men.  Her name is Atreia but to her people she is simply Atreii.  When Paul Atrestes father is captured by the sand people they find the girl.  She calls herself Princess Alia but is known as Princess Alias in the desert and even though she is a princess she gets a little angry and kicks a sand man when he tells her to go to sleep.  Then a sand demon (a huge snake like monster) comes down and eats Paul's father and then attacks Alia.  Alia goes to save Paul but is captured too.  Later she is brought to a prison by King Paul where she is held prisoner for being a princess and not a woman.  Once in a while she tells Paul about the planet which is dying so she can come back to live with her father.  So Paul is in prison for a long time until he escapes to a planet where the sand men can't hurt him.  He meets a young girl who is a prophetess named Padme and they start a new life together on the new planet.

It took a real long time for the characters to do something, and it took a long time to get to the point. I mean a character was a big stupid old guy and he did a bad thing and I got really bored by the fact that nobody seemed to care.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie that I just had to see. I was so interested in it. The movie is set in the 1950's during the Vietnam war. A group of men in their early 20's take a job at a research plant that is in charge of testing a new experimental drug. The group has a pretty dysfunctional relationship. One of the guys, a very intelligent but socially awkward person is a big fan of a woman that is at the plant. He wants to get to know her and she doesn't feel too comfortable about it. This leads to a situation in which there are a couple of girls. They are very attractive and all but one is a lesbian. In between the action the movie has a lot of comedy. I found the comedy in the movie very funny.

Some of the things that bothered me about the first film are not that big of a deal.  A lot of the people who are unhappy in this one, I'm sure have never even seen the other two.  They're mostly like in the first movie, a little too nice.  There is a nice scene in the end that was a bit funny.  What bothers me the most is the movie does end with that great line about how they're like two cats fighting.  But I thought that was one of the funniest scenes of the whole series.  I like the character of Gipsy Danger and he has a lot of good moments here and there.  The rest of the cast are all very good as well.  This is a great movie and a good finale to a great trilogy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good sequel to a good old story: The Black Widow. This movie was directed by John Frankenheimer and stars Gene Hackman as the bad ass Black Widow who works as a mercenary for a wealthy American corporation, The Rockford Files. She also has a friend named Steve McQueen who has been hired by the company to help find and retrieve a priceless artifact called The Black Box. The Rockfords are all very stereotypical American characters, The Black widow being the only one who seems to have a lot of brains, not just to think like a person but to fight like a real woman who can kill a man with one blow. The acting is ok for the most part, however there are a couple of bad performances here and there which can be attributed to the fact that the movie was made in 1972. One actor I like is Gary Cooper, who has a couple good lines, however Cooper is over rated. This movie is not a classic as some would have you believe it to be, it is still an entertaining movie with a decent plot, but it lacks a little something to really make it good.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was the worst movie I've seen in a while and for the record its not really that bad either! It has a very short story and is a comedy based on an old radio play. It is really bad! Its like seeing someone else's voice from a radio play read by someone who's not their voice or acting like they are too. I am not sure how to describe it other than it was so awful it was funny, but it was not very good at all. I saw this one at the Cincy Playhouse but it didn't have any real actors in it. You might want to turn your speakers up in a theatre as you will be hearing awful things about this movie: (A short story: )   The story starts off in a bar with some guys who are being chased by a man with a bat and a gun. After some of them get killed and the men are running for their lives, they stop to pick up a woman and a little boy. He tells them a really long story about a little girl who is being pursued by a guy with a sword and a bat. He has a bunch of girls following him around as well and they will follow a little kid if the girl is there. It starts off a little funny until some of the girls start talking about this guy that is with the sword and bat and how he always gets the girl and they always fight about who gets the girls. At the end of the movie we are left wondering how a guy gets the sword, bat and girl in a small town in a cave. I would have liked to know how they got it and what they were going to do with them.   When I saw the trailer and read the synopsis I thought they were trying to make this into something with a little more "action" in it, but not really any more. The cast was all the same, just one actor for all the movie's jokes and one actor to talk about these girls. I thought it would have been funny if there were a few guys in it with a couple of women and some of these girls would have gotten killed by the guy with the gun and sword.

The movie is very well written and the actors gave all of them really good performances.   The story of " The Dark Knight" is very good, and is really scary when the Joker comes. In this movie, the Joker kills someone, but before they kill him, they get a phone call that the police is on their way. The Joker and the other criminals think it is a fake call, but Batman has to take the person to the hospital. This is not all that easy as the Joker and his henchmen do some nasty things. The climax was very nice and scary.  I would recommend this movie.

I said, and turned over to my room. When I looked in my closet I discovered that there was a little girl sleeping in there. "Hey," I said. "What are you doing in here? Come on, you're not going to come out!" And she started to say something about being a little person and a little child. And then she fell over the edge of the closet. "Oh!" I shouted. "Get up, little girl! You can't just lie there like that!" And so she climbed out of the wardrobe. "Well," she said, "I'm not going back in." "You better not!" I yelled. And I pulled her up. "You should take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror," I told her. "That's how you should look all the time!" But she just said "Yes, Aunt Eileen."  And so she slept there, all day long, and I never saw her again. But then the little girl told me she had a big brother! And he wanted to know where he was. And she said he had to go home to bed. So she sat up and cried, "Poor little brother! I'll go home and play." And then her little brother came back! So he got up, and was crying his eyes out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really wanted to like this movie. It has everything you want from a movie about a girl who goes into a rock band and loses her parents. It is not without it's faults, but for the most part this is a very well-acted movie. Even when there are a few bad parts in the story.   When a bandleader of a rock group tells you to "Get up and get down" he is not kidding. She has gone out and tried to live her life, but has gotten into a bit of a mess.  In a way, this is similar to what I've experienced in real life with my parents, with the same people over and over. I feel the same emotions when I see them on the news.  I was really looking forward to seeing her in real-life, but unfortunately this is just another piece of bad luck. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked this movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.    It's not as good as it looks.  I liked how it kept the story simple, even though there were tons of characters.  I also liked that it seemed very easy to understand what was happening, even if it's a very simple story.  The only flaw is that the last ten minutes, especially the ending, were really hard to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the fact that this movie has a plot.   The film is about a little boy and his father, who go to a party to get some free food.  He thinks that they have won the lottery, but it isn't.  And, there are some things about the movie that I don't like.  First of all, I am just sick of seeing people in a wheelchair.  Second, I don' like the way the father is talking.  Third, the film is really, really long.  This is one of those movies that I would rather have watched when I was younger.  If only I knew how long it was...I might have had a chance.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got this movie at a bargain bin on a whim, and I couldn't have been more pleased!   It's actually kind of a different movie from the rest of the series, at least as far as the story goes, and it's definitely more of an adventure, and more funny, than the series is.   The action is really cool, it has a good pace, with lots of character interaction, and great characters in general.  It doesn't get bogged down by exposition or exposition being used to pad the plot, it keeps it's pace in the best possible way, and just makes everything even better.  I do think the movie would have benefited from a bit of time in a dark theater, as it is quite long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It has a good story line with good characters and nice visuals. It was a nice watch and even though it didn't have a plot, it had a good balance of humor and drama and it was good.   I didn't really like the movie too much, I was never a fan of the movies or of the series (until I saw "Polar Express" which was a pretty good movie) but this was still a nice movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never seen a film like this before.   It is a dark comedy about a couple of friends that want to get together.  One of the best parts is when the wife,  comes over.  She is beautiful, and we get to see her and her husband in a fun kind of way.  He is a kind and gentle guy. He is in a little trouble and she is trying to help him.  The movie also has a funny ending that is really funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was looking forward to this movie for a while. It is not perfect by any means but I was excited to see what they would add to this. I'm glad they have. The movie is very good. The music was very good and the plot is very interesting. The action was great but the acting wasn't as good as the script. It was good but I would have liked to see more of the movie and what the plot was about. It seemed the writer got too much information on what the character was about when they made the movie.   I love this movie. It's good and I'm happy they added a bit more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie last night at the local movie theater, and the movie was quite entertaining and pretty good.   It is not exactly a science fiction movie, but it is one that gets pretty close.  In the movie, the alien called the "Kodiak" comes into Earth's solar system and goes into orbit around the sun. It is said that this space probe will crash onto Earth. When it crashes, the "solar system" goes into chaos because of the crash and is very cold.  The Kodiak is a very small space probe, but the power to control it comes from "mother stars" -- small yellow stars that are found in the "system." These "mother" stars are dying, but they have a magnetic force that makes them go around the earth -- the Earth's magnetic field makes it so they don't fly right around.  Eventually, these stars die, but their magnetic fields don't die with them, and they keep spinning and spinning. These magnetic fields are said to be so powerful, that when a "doom" star like the sun gets near the Earth, the magnetic fields of those suns create a magnetic field that makes a giant explosion -- one that sends the "moon" into orbit over the Earth! The film tells how the solar system gets to be frozen in ice, how the "mother star" is destroyed and the Kodiak "succeeds" at crashing into Earth and causing such havoc!  I like to believe that a lot of this is true, but I've read that this movie was made before the original Star Wars movies and was taken out of context.  At one point, it says that when the solar field is down around the Earth and the moon enters orbit, the planets' magnetic fields will be knocked off their original positions and the planets will drift in space!   The "dome" in the movie is not very big.  It has a very high temperature and is about 30,000 miles up.  So, this movie isn't the best, but for a short time, I enjoyed it a lot.  A little more on the science in this movie: A. When the Earth was formed it was very cold -- the temperature was about minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit. This was also the same temperature as the outer regions of the sun's atmosphere. At the time of the earth's formation, the sun was about 25,000,000 kilometers from the earth, and
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The opening of the movie is just like you would expect from a first love. You get the girl and the guy are in love. The story starts to slow down a little but then it picks up speed again and it is very interesting. The last half of the film is just about the story. We get to meet new characters that help the story along. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A really good movie about a young girl with a big dreams and the dreams never come true. It's the story of a young woman who decides to make a deal with a devil who has promised to kill everyone she loves if she does a favor for him. So she gets her family kidnapped by this devil who turns out to be a good guy. They escape and he lets them leave but he tells them a great evil is coming to the land and if they don't do something it will take them to Hell and if that happens they're going to get all the evil there is. That's where she turns to help her friends and they start to fight each other to stop the evil from coming. The main characters are the best characters in the world. The evil is really evil. It has been there for hundreds of years and it's the people who are evil who make the world so evil. The film has a very simple plot but the execution is so good and the actors do a really good job. This was a really great movie that I recommend to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I could only take one movie in 2017 with me to heaven, it would be I Am Not a Witch.   It's a movie of redemption, of redemption for a bad man and his daughter.   When a man is sentenced to be hanged for witchcraft in 1623 New England, a small town witch-finder's group is sent to save him from his fate.  The story is simple enough.  A bad man is put to death. He's a witch, a bad person. His daughter is also a witch and the witch-hunter's group wants to bring her down as well.  With his daughter now a witch too, she'll try to get revenge and stop the witch hunters.  It gets a little complicated, though.  The evil witch tries to murder a witch as well, which is why the witch hunts group is put together.  I didn't find it very interesting.  I think it has the right themes to be a fun, though not very original movie.  But it's got that old-timey charm.  What really impressed me about I Am not a Witch were the performances.  Peter Sarsgaard is a pretty bad man in this movie. It's hard to watch and even harder to like him.  This movie is the first in the trilogy, and it's pretty good.  Sarsgard isn't bad.  And he isn't a nice guy.  He's got a lot to say and he doesn't always say it with good intentions.  However, he's good-natured enough to be amusing.  His character is pretty well-drawn, although he could have been a little more likeable.  While there is a lot of fighting, it's mostly one-on-one.  There are a few moments when a big group of witches attack.  In the second act, things are a bit less intense.  Overall, I Am...Witch...Is...Great... is a good watch, with a few nice moments. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a while I didn't think this movie had a chance of being good. That was only my opinion. The fact of the matter is that this movie is one of the better movies I've ever seen, maybe the best I've seen. It's a terrific movie. The performances are brilliant. The plot is very simple but complex. You can look at it a million different ways. It goes from beginning to end with an exciting plot. The movie has a really good ending. This movie is a must see for anybody with an interest in action or war movies. It shows a whole new side of war.

She is the villainous sidekick to the male lead, who she actually cares for a lot and is actually a very good actor. It has that "bad" girl feel to it but she is in a good place and is a very likable person.   There are some moments that were a little cliched but otherwise this is a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many of the other reviews, this movie really shows you the problems with the American economy today.   In the first half you have a man who wants to make a buck.  He does not know that you can make a much bigger buck in Vietnam by selling war bonds.  They are very expensive for someone in his position to buy.  But we also get to see that there is a whole world out there that is just as desperate to live as America is to live.  I think if they gave us an explanation on the Viet Nam war, I might have understood.  The story is about a man that wants to buy a ticket home to his family.  However, the war is going on and he finds himself with a bunch of soldiers who are doing the same thing.  And as the Viet Nam war turns sour, his life is ruined.  This is a real tragedy, and a good reminder of the dangers of our country's involvement in the world today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In short, I loved the movie.   The plot is simple, if convoluted.  The villain is evil but I didn't mind, he was not a strong or original villain.  There was nothing really wrong with the movie, but if you want a simple plot, I suppose you can go without.  I liked the story and the characters, they all had some problems, but none were huge.  This was a simple movie with good plot, and no great or bad characters.  However, I have to say that I had fun watching this movie and I look forward to it next weekend.

I saw the movie the first time in the theatre, then I watched it again the second time, and this time I was so glad that I saw it the third time too   This movie was soooo good I watched the film 3 times and every time I watched I got soooo much fun out of it . It is awesome and I loved it  I think this movie is the most realistic depiction of a police officer.   You will learn that every police officer is an idiot, you will also learn that most cops are stupid and most people have a very strange sense of humor and you will learn about other police work   The movie is very good for its first 10 minutes when you see how it really is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was hoping for a sequel of the classic T-Rex movie. I've seen it several times on TV, and I had read reviews of it as a child, but never thought about buying it. It was a long time before I finally went back and bought it. A wonderful film! It was so funny, and it had great dinosaurs that you never saw before. Even the most boring film is better than this one! I like watching this with my grandchildren and friends, as they can laugh and learn something about nature.   "It is a time when dinosaurs will be found by the people who live in the great open plain. They will gather in little villages and towns, and their stories will be told. This is a great time when a boy will learn that the animals are not cruel, nor will they eat him. In these places they will live with man and with plants and trees, and with animals and birds and fish and birds of all kinds. Their children will sing and dance and dance again, and they will play for the good things they have discovered. There will be a feast in the evening, and in the morning there will be plenty of good things to eat. But the little boy will be glad he is in a time like this, where nature does not hate him, where he is able to look upon a man and a woman, a father and his loving wife, with loving eyes. They have not eaten their children. Their loving hearts are not sad, or sad in any way. They do not eat because they are hungry, or because they have hurt themselves. They are happy and good. They love the little child who is born at home.      The little boy is the friend of the father, and is always nice to him and his wife, and the animals too. His little mother plays with him and gets angry when he runs away. They all have hearts like his father's heart, and his mother's heart is more beautiful and more delicate than any heart he has ever seen."

And the music in the opening is very pleasant and upbeat.   I did enjoy the movie very much. It did have a good story, though a bit predictable for my taste.  It's got a little romance and a little science fiction. The cast is pretty good and the action scenes are good. This movie isn't the best I've seen, but it's definitely worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is another gem from one of my favorite directors of all time   The movie is about a group of people that have just started a new life on a farm in the middle of nowhere in Vermont. They soon find out that it was a very bad idea to move in, after they find out there is not only a dead body rotting in the barn, but they find that there is no food for their animals. They decide to venture out in search of food.   I watched the movie the day after it was released   and I think it's a bit of a mixed bag. The story is told in a way that I could be convinced that this was a true story, but the direction is really weak and the acting is sub par. I think the director just wanted to make a funny movie and he had a lot of fun doing so. The special effects are good but there were a lot that needed work. For example, the scene where two people are trying to pull a giant tree limb off of a big man is just a very awkward attempt at moving a scene and the whole thing is rushed and cheesy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie a lot.   You really feel a little bit sad and a bit sadder when we know that she is going to end it all.   The writing was quite good, I liked how the narrator talks about how she wanted to be a good mom, but we all know that a great mother can't help but fall.  In the end we learn that her son, who was already a big boy, is to be 10 years old.  I didn't like how in the end her son said that he couldn't bear being in her house.  He said that the house was too dirty and the furniture was old and dusty.  This movie is so sad and heartbreaking, we can't really see it and we feel it in our hearts.  After the credits we are shown a picture of her son holding her hand.  The movie was so well written and I thought it was a really good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movie   I have seen this year.   The plot is not your usual action movie.  There is something about this movie that really makes it unique.  The director does a great job keeping the pace slow, but when the action does start, you will see why it is not the same normal movie that other people have made.  This movie has a unique and unique atmosphere.  It is not a typical movie about some bad guy who just wants to kill some people in the middle of a crowded city. It is about a woman who is a great fighter, and there is a secret about her that just needs to be uncovered.  I can see why this movie is not an ordinary movie.    This is a movie that keeps the viewer interested through it's unique and fun story.  If you liked the movies "The Expendables" or "The Rock," then you will like this one.  Also, if you are a fan of the 90's, you should really enjoy this movie.

It's the only movie in the series I watched as a kid. I loved the music, the character development, and the humor. I'm glad that I was a kid then so I could laugh at the bad guys (although I liked some of the good guys too) and laugh with the good characters. This was a funny movie. I also loved that I could make up my own ending for a scene with a magic sword and a bad guy with his own magical sword.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ...   When I saw it, I was a bit skeptical, because I never thought about the genre of zombie movies at all.   But I had to see if this was really a good zombie movie with a good script.  After watching it, there is no doubt that this is a good Zombie movie.  It was not very good, but it was a good one and I recommend it to those who have a hard time to understand why this movie was made.  This movie is not very original, and it is not a typical Zombie movie, because the zombies are very rare in movies, but this movie is good.  I like that they made a lot of money by creating a zombie movie that is different from other zombies movies and that they did not make a stupid movie.

The characters, although sometimes difficult to like or understand, are interesting. The movie is good fun, the music is good, and it's good to see a director at the end of his career trying to make something different and more interesting. I don't think that this film will be remembered in a lot, but I think it's worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last couple months have been interesting for me. I'm going to say a bit of a secret: I'm very good at watching films. But when I'm not watching a movie, I'm writing about a movie.   I remember being in college and being surprised by how good the students were at writing articles about film:  The New York Times had a weekly review of the films in the New York International Film Festival in 1981.  And I'm no different.  I've written three articles about films in as many years:  - In this past Saturday evening, an 8-year-old boy and a girl named Amanda, 7, were playing on the steps of a New York City apartment building in Brooklyn when an elderly man came out with a knife in his hand.  The man said that he had lost a finger during a game of checkers and the family's landlord had promised to set them up a table.  When the man came inside the apartment the boys played checkers on the floor, but Amanda, the younger, won.  Amanda tried again but lost again.  Then the landlord appeared.  He gave the boy some money and asked him to come downstairs and play again. Amanda began to play on the stairs, but the boy said that the landlord didn't like that kind of play.  Finally the landlord called the boy down the stairs.  She asked him what he did in the past few hours, and then asked him how Amanda was feeling.  One of the boy's eyes turned red and he said that she had to be carried to the car.  At this point, I decided that Amanda was the most extraordinary child I'd ever seen.  My parents are both educators and I was never taught that children had emotions or emotions could do things for other children that we would not do for ourselves.  But that day the boy started crying and Amanda held him.  Before they got to the front door, she hugged him. A moment later she told him to get back downstairs and told him that she couldn't take him anymore.  This child's father was standing behind the boy as he walked up the stairs and he heard the boy begging for his mother.  It was the beginning of the end of their relationship. The father's only consolation was that Amanda's mother and father had once been lovers. He didn't see them as a married couple.  As the boy walked up to the door, Amanda tried to hold him

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I can't say much about a movie, I'm sure you're better off reading the film review, I did like it and I'll tell you how!   "The Manchurian Candidate" (1959) is a psychological horror movie in the form of a film noir with some science fiction action, where an American businessman (Humphrey Bogart) is accused of being a communist agent who has gone rogue and is trying to kill the president. The American president (Val Kilmer) is determined to get the evidence against the real American agent, and to this end he turns to the CIA for help.   The CIA, of course, do a terrible job (at least the ones I saw) of getting the evidence they need (and a good deal of it is missing) but when they do manage to track the real agent down he is unceremoniously killed in a plane crash and they are then told that the real killer is the dead agent and that he is now in Soviet hands.   on the evidence of the American agent that is, they find out that the agent was an agent of a man named David (played by Bogart, in a role that makes him look like a young Jackie Gleason) who was a secret agent for the CIA from 1933-1955. (The CIA only has the job of recruiting spies, there is no actual covert action involved, but David was an ex-spy who was brought in to do some espionage for the US and to keep an eye on his friend, the American. David also was known for making a big deal out of all the women he seduced, a hobby of the man who has the title of 'The Man-churricane') David and his friend have the job to kill as many American people as they can, either by sabotaging nuclear missiles or by sabotages involving dirty bombs, the latter of which was being worked on by David who is known to be very skilled at creating them. When David is killed the film moves on to show what happens to the American president.  In one of the worst and most laughable uses of CGI I have ever seen. The president and his staff travel to a nuclear test site to investigate the cause of the explosion that is destroying a city.

The story is told from the point of view of a dog and the two men he is trying to find a home for.   This film has a great cast with Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Jack Lemmon and William Powell all great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As much as I like the movie I am a little disappointed about the ending.   While I enjoyed the movie it does not conclude the story as it starts off.  The ending seems forced at this point to be good.  When they say the end is near you have to hope the show ends when it's supposed to which is not for a long time.  I hope they bring the series back soon because I was looking forward to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For my first movie, I was not too sure how the story was going to unfold. My friends who were also going to be in the theater that night recommended the movie and we each wanted to try it out.   At first, I felt that the movie was a little rushed and a little slow. I felt like the characters were so stiff and unemotional. But, after about a half hour of watching, I realized that I was in for a treat!   There was a scene in the movie that was filmed in New York City, in the 1920s. The film stars Fredric March and Edith Head as a married couple in New England. Fredric, who is a playwright, and Ediths, who works in the newspaper, find that the country is going to war. In fact, they are both in the army.  When the war starts, Fredric is stationed at Fort Ticonderoga, New York. Edith is in Boston, working in a small shop.  Fredric's character is quite a different person when he is stationed there. Fredricks character is a bit eccentric and a bit of a madman. It is quite an eye-opener to see Fredricks characters personality change in just a few hours of film! It is an interesting character study!  In a later scene, Fredrick's character leaves the army to go back to New England and raise his family.  The movie also takes place in the 1950s. Fredrick and Edies son, Bill (Peter O'Toole), have a son.  Once Bill is born, Edith, Fredricks, Fred's friends and family decide to travel back to Boston. The group spends some time on the train but then has to go to Chicago to find another train.  It is a short train ride and Ed's character gets off the train. He then decides to stay at a hotel.  After a short time, the group is going back to Chicago, Fredrs character is in a bad mood because of the bad publicity that has been happening around the town of New York, and the death of the daughter of a local priest, Father Paul.  At this point, the movie starts to slow down and I was worried about the movie.  And then, I found out that it is very different from any other movie that I have seen.  I am so glad that I watched this movie and it made me feel as though I was
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in a beautiful theatre. The story and acting was great! I have seen it at theatres in many countries around the world and this one at the Hollywood Palace Theatre in Hollywood was a very special experience. It was a perfect day to go to see it and this was a great film. I hope to see more movies by the master of the camera.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was the second best movie about a child molestation that I have seen. This movie is much better than the first one. I like the movies the best that deal with child molestations. The characters are likable, the movie has many heartrending scenes and the writing is quite good. I think this is the best movie that a mother can ever see her daughter, her husband or her children as. The movie shows how the father cannot help his son from making his son the victim of molestation. The story is quite interesting and I enjoyed it very much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film about a family that grows up in a small farming community and makes the most of their idyllic farm. A nice movie to watch with friends and family on a lazy weekend. There is a lot of laughter, a lot to do, and it is easy to follow.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has all the hallmarks of good science fiction: it has great set pieces, and there is a certain style to the production. The movie doesn't really get going until about halfway through, though, so I'd suggest that you keep your eyes on the action.   The movie takes place in a world where all the humans have been wiped out, and the last human living in the world is a woman who works with a group of robots.  While the robots themselves are a bit silly, and don't really seem to get along with one another, they're a cute addition to the movie, and serve the story pretty well.  The humor is funny, but not always a great source of inspiration.  I'm not really sure what happened, or what the reason is for the robots to disappear. Maybe they were just too good, and all humans were exterminated?   While it's possible that the robots did what they did so they could live, it's a bit of a stretch to say they're "evil".   And I really enjoyed the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It looks like a Hollywood movie in every aspect.   This movie is made for a big audience, so it must have been an experience.  I thought the plot of the movie is very interesting.  It's very easy to see how the big bad guy will win.  When a guy was trying to do a movie for a major studio, the studio told him to use his family for an extra special effect and it worked like a charm.  That's why I'm glad that they didn't waste the money for a huge budget.  There are several good actors and actresses in this movie.  The story of this movie is well written and the actors did a good job in it.  This is a good thriller that you shouldn't miss.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So the movie has been out for a few weeks now. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it was about a couple of guys living in the woods who are trying to survive on an empty stomach. This is actually quite an interesting movie, it is not as bleak as it sounds. It has a lot of humor in it, and I think it is a very realistic movie about the hardships in one's life.   I gave this a 4 because it is so short, but I think that is pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a really good, heartwarming, touching, emotional, entertaining movie, with a wonderful message about love and caring. The story is very personal, and the ending is perfect.   The only negative thing about the movie is that it is too long, but that is probably the point: it is a movie about two very young kids coming of age, who love one another deeply.  The two are very much like two children who just got home from school, and then went and had fun with a cartoon for a while, and now have to put everything in perspective.  When I was a little kid, I loved the little cartoon, but now I know that this is the real thing. It has the same level of emotional complexity and heart as the real life, and if the kids want to play again one day, they will.  This movie will warm the hearts of everyone who loves the little animated creatures, because it's a wonderful time to be young, and kids like this do not need to be frightened away from what is beautiful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie because it is a horror movie but with a lot of humor in it. I really enjoyed it.

In the end, we have a beautiful woman with a gift for the world. But can she be trusted?

I like this movie, and it will be one I will always watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first ten minutes are really tense and the film does a good job at setting up the atmosphere of the horror film. The sound design is done very well and is reminiscent of films like Poltergeist or the Saw franchise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've enjoyed this movie since I saw the trailer for it at the premiere. It's a funny, well-acted comedy with a good story line and some decent dialogue. The cast does a good job of bringing out the personalities of all the characters and the story is very compelling. I wouldn't have expected this to be as well-made as it is, but the script and the direction do a good enough job of keeping it entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has many things going for it, but none of them more than any of the rest.   First off, the action, which is as good as you'd expect from a Marvel movie.  Second, we have the good old MCU crew doing their usual work as you would expect them to, but better, because they're better.  Third, this movie does the story justice, even if it seems a little rushed at times.  Fourth, it manages to be the only Marvel movie in the MCU that actually gets some fun moments.  Fifth, the film manages to find a great way to make you care about some of the characters that you love to hate.  Sixth, the story really is a good one, but it gets a little out of control at times when the action goes too wild, but not out of place in a Marvel film.  Seventh, even though this movie is for kids, you can still look forward to some great humor.  Eight, the ending was amazing, and the way it ties together all the Marvel elements of the film made me want to see more of the MCUs.  Nine, the first act was great, and while the second act lost a bit of steam, it was good enough for a Marvel Movie.  Overall, a great watch that you'll remember for a while.

I do not agree with the guy who said that the main character is the worst that he can possibly be. This is a good acting and acting is good when they get to a certain point in the movie. The character development is nice, and the story that it's a very good movie.   The acting is amazing and the music is good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the spring of 1973 I was driving through a snowstorm and an ad in my newspaper read "The Man Who Knew Too Much", written by my favorite writer Stephen King, which was the first film I had ever seen about a reporter who, after writing a series of articles about a strange phenomenon on an island in the Mississippi, begins to have strange dreams about his past which make him realize he had lived an awfully sad life and that all he had really done was witness the passing of a strange thing on a small island. When the stories that I had written about this strange phenomena became a big hit on the national news, a number of people showed up on the island to witness the strange phenomena and there was a very bad storm and several people died, and one of the islanders, named David, had a big problem and was dying. The only one of his kind on the entire island. His only hope was that David's wife was going to come back to life, so he wrote a story that she would come back and save David, so that he could continue to write about this thing that was happening in the sky and he would continue to be able to do his work and live a happy life as long as he could keep talking about it. And he did keep talking and writing about it and eventually David's dream came true in the form of a woman who came and saved David, but he never saw her again, so much so that she left him. And when a woman named Nancy came to the island she found David dead and she felt sorry for David and became a kind of a father figure to David, and then she decided to kill him, so she could stop writing about this unusual phenomenon and the only one who would have been able to help David and help him forget this thing was his wife, who had died of cancer, and so she killed him. So David, the only survivor of the strange phenomenon, begins the journey of his life to find Nancy and stop her from killing him. There are a lot of interesting things about this story and I recommend the movie to anyone who likes Stephen King. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "You've got to admire the balls that he (Ricky) has got," says one friend of a friend, and, "He'd be a hell of a man if he could find a job," adds another. "Ricky is a real one-man army," says a third. He is also a very popular man. People walk up to him all the time saying hello, and asking for pictures. Ricky takes pictures of them all. He always asks if they need any help with their questions. Ricky is a very good-looking man, with a pleasant manner. He speaks quite naturally and says what he thinks. He says he has never had an assignment so he would have to be very busy, but he is very popular. He likes women and he enjoys being with them. Ricky has been in the military all his life, but now he is a photographer. It was in the Army that he fell in love with a beautiful young nurse, and he has been married for about two months now. In the early days of the war he had two girlfriends. "I've got a good life now," he says, "and I don't feel so bad about it at all. I was in good company. Everyone else was doing something very much better than I was. Now they are all dead. All of the soldiers are. All the girls were." In the middle of a picture Ricky is about to start again when a call comes through to the sergeant. "Captain, my plane has just crashed in the middle there," he hears himself saying, and then, "I'm sorry, captain. I'm very sorry. It's just a fright, really." When they get to the hospital he is told to leave the hospital and go to a place called the Old Wounds, which is very close to the landing strip and they have a room for him there. But he does not want to go, he does things his way. And then he says to the nurse, "That's the most frightful thing I've ever seen. My god! It's as though the whole thing were just swallowed up by a black hole." The nurses are all laughing at him. They say, "We'll come back and do your stitches again." He gets to work on a small wound, which he stitches up himself, while they are waiting. When he gets back the nurses say to him, "You're a lucky man, you have just saved our lives. We'll

I thought this was a fairly good movie. There was a couple of little plot holes that got brought up. Some of the other characters were a little clichéd. This movie is a "good movie" for fans of horror.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am so impressed with the film. The screenplay is the perfect blend of mystery and action. A little kid is being taken to a haunted house when the evil spirit from the past comes to visit and makes him do terrible things. The movie is a bit short at two hours. The kid has to battle an evil spirit in his nightmares and then the movie ends. If you like scary movies then this is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been looking for something to fill my empty time on a day off, and this is the movie that has been on my "to watch" list for a long time. It is not that long long. The story takes place at a university that has a number of student organizations to compete with. The main thing is a "lunatic" that goes into a group of "freak" students that aren't so easy to deal with and have some strange behavior. I didn't feel this movie was a comedy, but rather a story that would interest those interested in a bit of science fiction.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As the title of the movie implies, it's a story about a little girl who becomes a superhero when her father gets attacked by an evil clown. I thought this was a pretty good, family-friendly movie with a good premise and pretty good action, as well as a few pretty good comedy moments.   The story takes place when the little girl's father, Mr. Toto (played by Billy Crystal, who was in another good movie called Superbad ) has a heart attack in the hospital. This leads to her father being sent to a new "care facility". In the care facility the doctor tries to diagnose the problem as a heart problem, but the poor doctor ends up putting the little guy through a "healing shower" by getting him wet. It turns out that the clowns are a part of a carnival and they have been attacking people, and also taking pictures of them with their phone. One night the clown's go to the house of a little boy named Billy (played as a kid by Billy West), and they use the photos to blackmail him. One day he is on his way home from school when he bumps into the clown. He gets scared and runs off, but soon realizes that he's being followed by the clown and the clown takes the boy down a long, dark tunnel, where he meets several other clowns (including a girl, played by Susan Sarandon). There is also an older guy who seems to be the leader of the clown gang (played in a way that's really creepy by a young John Leguizamo), who tries to get the child to join him. The clowns then get him to go into a circus show, where the "chimeras" are made. The little girl, as a little kid, is horrified by this, and wants nothing to do with them. But, soon realizes the good of the circus when she falls in love with one of the carnival acts. In order to protect her, the clown group and the carnivals decide to move to a small city to protect themselves from the evil clowns, and Billy is the only one who is able to help her out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first few minutes were an eerie slow-burner that gave you a very eerie feel of a haunted house. I couldn't get my head around the fact that all these kids were in this house all the time with nothing to do but stare at each other for the whole film.   It just got more eerie from there.  The story was pretty much predictable but I liked it for the first time in awhile.  I liked that the kids went outside for a walk and came back without a scratch on them.  It was a beautiful sunset.  This movie is just great.

I love the humor of the movie as well as the fact that the movie does a good job of explaining to a younger generation what a "soul-mate" is and how such a person is important and should be treated by the family. The movie is not for the timid but I think it's a good one to start out with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (     )   This is another in a long line of underrated, but often funny and enjoyable, movies from the '50s.   As with the rest of the films that star a famous actor (  e.g.  The Seven Year Itch  ,  Citizen Kane ),  The New York Story is about a group of people in New York trying to keep their little family running while they all try to figure out what the heck is going on in their lives and which side of the tracks they are on.  One of the first things you will notice about this film is that there is a very subtle, almost invisible subtext of racism present.  Some of the more cynical characters in the film openly talk about it.  Also, some of the black characters are more sympathetic, such as the poor (poor white) woman who looks like a prostitute, while some of them look like stereotypical black characters (like the pimp).   In terms of plot, The New-York Story is a comedy about trying to make your way in the world.  First of all, you will be pleased to know that the film was filmed in color.  When you think about it, that is a big deal.  Then you will have no idea how good the camerawork is or how good it looks.  I did a lot of research into the color grading of the film when it was originally made in the late '40s, and the results are really quite stunning.  There is a lot more than just color to the film, but if you have ever seen a color film with a great filmic effect (in this case, the use of colored backgrounds to convey a sense of distance) this is it. It is a combination of a great soundtrack and a very funny script.  The story has some truly great laughs, but they are not really funny until the final act.  As a kid I liked this movie and it was one of my favorites when I was a child.  This movie is truly something of a treat for any age group. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie made me love both of its characters even though he is a jerk.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I enjoyed this movie a lot!   In my opinion this is a perfect example of why the movie business has gone off the rails.   The whole picture of the movie is that of a very rich person who wants to take care of his family with the help of his servant. However one day he meets a very poor girl who is sick with malaria.  The movie is very romantic.  However it is so wrong to think that a man's worth is measured by how much money he has. The poor girl in the movie goes to visit the man's home but is too sick to leave. Her husband comes to her home to take her. But she is so poor that he is only able to give her one penny and it does not give her enough to live.  Eventually the servant and the poor girl make love and she gives birth to a baby girl who looks like a doll.  I think that the movie makers are trying to show the effect that poverty and sickness had on the poor people. The movie portrays the girl and her husband with a lot of love and tenderness.  But the movie does not stop there.  During the course of the film the poor man begins to work for the rich man and the rich gets the girl pregnant.  As a result the rich girl and the boy are born to the servant.  Unfortunately in the end of the story a child born to a rich boy comes to resent the rich boy and so he kills him and the wife with a knife.  This was a horrible, depressing, and boring movie.  The poor girl is a pretty doll. The girl has a big mouth but is a poor actress.  It was so sad to see a film with so much love and love of life and so little of it!  The poor man is not an evil man. The rich people are so bad that if they could do it all over again they would do it differently. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's really no other way to describe this movie, besides saying it's like being in a fairy tale. It's like all the movies you love ( like Cinderella or Cinderella III ) except you can't fall in love with Cinderella or marry her. The story isn't about a prince and a princess, so there isn't a whole lot to like about this movie.   The acting is all perfect in this movie- all the girls have perfect lines.  The song is beautiful.  I wish there was an "after" picture of these two characters on the screen to show what they did in the park.  For adults only.

The movie is fun to watch with lots of good laughs, but you do get the feeling that there's a lot of things that are going to be different going forward. The action, the humor, the characters are all pretty original, but at times things get a bit silly.   This is the first time I've seen the movie, but I'm pretty sure I'll like it a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second part of the series starts the very good, the second part is a little bit different: the first part was a very nice comedy about two teenagers with big dreams, that in their dreams would be able to become a rock band or become the new rock band, then they were sent to a strange town where they find a large body with no head and a very peculiar accent. The second half is different: it is about a group of people who are trying to bring back an alien who went out to the sun and disappeared and were able to bring him back by changing the water into something that can fly to the other planets (not so easy: it falls to pieces, then to pieces).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the first film in the series, this film does a great job at showing what a war is like through the eyes of the characters.   I loved the fact that the audience got to see the whole war through the characters eyes, this is why I am giving it a four, I was never bored during the entire film.  As a first war film, this was a pretty good one.  I would definitely give it a shot,  but I think the film could have done a little more.   What I Like:  What I liked about the film was the idea that it had a kind of war between two countries, one that had very few people and was a little country that did not want war, but at the same time it had no one to fight it.  The war was a horrible thing, not the fighting itself, but that it was taking place and that it affected so many people.  Also, the setting was fantastic and gave the feeling that it could happen anywhere.  It is not an easy movie to watch, but if you give it your undivided attention, it will be a great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's so bad about this movie? Well, for one thing, a large portion of the film focuses on what's essentially a character's attempt to recover from being sexually abused by her own mother. It's a slow-moving, almost pretentious mess that's pretty much the worst example of what a Hollywood blockbuster can be when it doesn't get the humor it needs or the talent it needs. It feels like an extended version of something that already existed, but with no more humor and no more imagination, and it only takes about twenty minutes to get where it should be.   As for the plot, this one is really hard to explain without giving too much away, but it does have a fairly simple premise: An orphanage is being overrun by a gang of bullies, and the parents are trying to protect their kids by putting a stop to it. But the kids have been drinking a lot, and their father has to give them a "dampening" spell, which makes them seem like children who don't know what they're doing.  The plot, while clunky, is still enjoyable, especially if you're not bothered by the characters being completely uninterested in anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   " The Legend of Boggy Creek " is an entertaining picture that's sure to please even the most jaded of moviegoers.   Set during the Gold Rush period, " The Boggy Creek " depicts the events leading to the founding of the United States, especially the early years of the country, the Gold Run and the famous battle of the creek.  In a fun, well-done, and very entertaining story, "The Boggy" tells the tale of the early life of James Van Arsdale, who is one of the first pioneers to settle in the new territory.  When he is arrested, the court-martial is held where he is sentenced to serve a four-year sentence in the California Territory.  Van Arsvale's story takes a peculiar turn when the jailbreak he and his fellow outlaws (Sam "Buffalo Bill" Sawyer and Will "Buffaloes" Jackson) manage to pull off is only the beginning of their many adventures.  The Bogies will have to deal with a large number of other outlaws and outlaws-in-training as well as the local authorities.  With a plot that is well-choreographed and an excellent cast, the film certainly has the makings of a classic Western.  As a film, "Boggy Creek" is a fairly good one.  It's definitely a good time with some terrific fight scenes.  For the audience at home, a two-hour running time does not bother.  A strong performance by the three leads does little to diminish the film's charm.  "BOGGY CREEK" is certainly entertaining from beginning to end and has enough action to keep even the slow of heart entertained. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a must see!   The story behind the film, was written by John Williams (one of the best film composers), a great writer.   His voice is an integral part of the story, the soundtrack and special effects are outstanding.  The actors are all wonderful and can make you laugh.  This is a wonderful film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "My favorite movie of all time" ~ John Milius I have never read a book by George Lucas, except for the Star Wars movies. He's made a lot of great movies, and a lot good.  I'm not going to make an analysis about Star Wars, or talk about why he is the greatest director in the history of cinema. I will say this... George Lucas is a genius!   It's good to watch a good science fiction movie once in a while.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't think I've seen a movie like this since the good ol days of 70's television shows like Cagney & Lacey, My Three Sons, and I Dream of Jeannie. It was a big part of my growing up, and still is. It was fun and very entertaining, so don't skip it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie, like all the other films from the '80s, was pretty good, but that doesn't mean I can't say that it was really entertaining.   I think the actor's voices made the movie quite enjoyable.  I thought the character, a teenager named Nicky, was rather annoying, but then again, I am really just a teenager...   If you are not too young, then you really don't need to watch this movie.  If, however, you are an old time movie buff like myself, then this movie is not only entertaining, but it is a very good time!

It's an intense, adrenaline rush like you can't help but have.       The actors did a great job.  They got really drunk and made a couple of crazy faces.  I love how the movie has a very serious mood.  The movie also gives you a lot of scenes where the characters are drunk.  It really makes the movie a little more intense and gives a good view into the characters' personalities. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You've got a good story that could be written with a better ending. And the ending is well done. The movie doesn't waste its time. There is no wasted time. You could put a small group of people in a real small house. A real small kitchen. A little bed. And a real little bedroom. You can build a whole town here. There are some real little things like a little tree and a couple of little people who seem to be trying to find a home. It's just a good little movie about the search for one's own home.

It is a story about two old men who run from the police on a mission to kill a man who has killed many people. It starts off a little slow but the characters are the ones who really make it stand out. A great action movie in every way!

L., St. Paul, Minnesota       I thought this movie was very creative. The main characters were fun. I liked the music. I really liked the story line. It made me laugh. It has a good heart to it, and it was funny at times. It was not too complicated either. The actors were wonderful and I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It's hard to review a movie in which the main character spends half the movie looking for love on the first date. This movie isn't as sexy as the trailers promise it will be, so it's more like a romantic comedy, if a movie about a guy who goes on a date with a cute girl in a romantic movie can be considered a romantic...or a comedy, as it's basically a comedy in disguise. This is a movie I can see myself watching a lot of times for different reasons: It's funny, it's romantic and the cast is fantastic. I don't know how I would describe this movie, but I think if you like movies about guys who don't find love, you might enjoy this movie a lot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first "serious" movie I have seen since seeing "Tales from the Crypt" with the legendary George Romero.   I was very surprised at how well the movie is paced, it moves along at a pretty good pace (almost too good) and has some very good acting, some of the actors (especially the two "troubled" characters) were very good.  Some of the scenes were also very well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't see any point in reviewing a movie about people who just want to be seen for their bodies, who just love to take off their clothes and have sex and what not.   The only thing I liked about it was the movie posters which looked like a great big picture of the actors.  It's a very well-acted film but if I wanted a good old fashioned gay porn, I'd find it in the "Stoner's Delight" section of my local porn shop. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A really excellent, well done film which explores the nature of the human relationship to food.   It shows how the human being has become a food animal and how the food chain has become so interwoven that no matter how much people may try to cut it down, they will never be able to do so because they are the products of an interrelated chain of interdependence.  And the food we eat is the product of a system which is the result of the interdop- tional cooperation of innumerable other species and the mutual reinforcement of their mutual actions which are so many steps removed from the actions of the one species, and which has been formed over a period of millions of years (some millions) in the same environment.  The result is that even though the human beings who are eating the food are not themselves the food (as many of them like to think) they are being the beneficiaries of the food they are eating and so their own food needs are being met by feeding others.  There is a certain element of truth in this but not all of it.  The problem is not that we have evolved into this system in which we are part of a network and this system is feeding on a wider network which is fed on a wide network and so on to infinity, and our needs are fed by the system in order to satisfy our own needs.  It is a highly efficient system and its results are extraordinary.  I have heard some people say that if the food system has evolved so that people can eat what they like, why not make them eat less and let others starve (or kill them as they are often treated in the Middle East).   But I am not sure about that, because the fact is that the vast majority of the people who make their living by selling food and other things do not think about it at all and so think that, whatever the price and whatever the quantity they are selling at, it must be all right to eat what people like because they want to eat it. The fact is, however, that people like what they eat and that the food which they eat is very good for them. The same people who tell me this also tell me that the rich people (because they make so much money) are no longer the rich.  As a matter of fact, they never were the rich because they never had enough food. All they could do was to try to get more and more food and more andmore money for
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie on DVD in a theater near my house. My wife and I were both sitting in the front row. I am not a film buff, but I have seen some good movies in my time, and I think that this is a decent one. I loved the characters, the suspenseful pacing, and the twists. I think if you can get past the bad acting, it is a good and interesting movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen a lot of movies this year, and for the most part I've enjoyed them. I thought this one was better than most movies I've liked this year.   This movie is about a young man who lives in a small town, in the backcountry of Kansas. He is a loner who isn't afraid to stand up to a lot. He has a lot on his mind and this movie explores that.  He is also quite smart and this leads him into a lot more trouble as the movie progresses.  I like the whole concept of the characters and I think the acting is good.  It was quite a slow and hard movie to watch but I didn't mind it at all.  All in all this was an enjoyable watch and a good little movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie! It was really a good, good action movie that had a good amount of plot and it had a great cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time i saw this movie i was so disappointed with the end. It was pretty much the same crap they always do.   That's a good way to describe how I felt about this movie. It's like watching a drunk go through a drunk walk.  Yes it is fun but if the end never shows up it's like seeing a drunk man get a beer for the first time and then start drinking it like he is going to die.  It's just that sad...   It's like a drunk get a shot in the head and says you got to have a good time with it, but then you get a hit and die because you're drunk.  I feel the characters don't have a real personality and the script doesn't do a lot of developing.  As I watched this I thought, "well maybe it's only a movie and I've heard some really bad things about it, maybe this movie should be a warning to all the people who go to a movie, and when they get to the end of the movie, they die."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Halloween" is a fun romp with a spooky sense of humor, but it is not a horror movie by any means. As far as the plot is concerned, it has all the ingredients to be a fun adventure that you would want to watch over and over. The characters are well developed and I always find myself enjoying them. The acting is always believable and the gore effects are nice, even if some of them are overdone. This is an enjoyable watch and is worth the watch at least once, especially if you are a fan of "Halloweentown".
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, the bad news:  I saw this film in a theater I'm in every Saturday. I love this theater because of the selection of films.   You're going to get a nice variety of good films, some bad ones, some that's not even a good film.  And this movie was bad.  I watched it before it even had an A-list actor attached, but this guy is a disaster as a film maker. This movie has a really bad plot that would've been funny if not for the fact that it was written.  There's a really annoying love interest, a stupid "tongue-in-cheek" guy that's a loser (he's only supposed to be funny, and not that stupid).  I don't know what the movie is, it's not funny or funny at all, it doesn't even have the charm of a bad comedy.  If you like cheesy, bad and cheesy, I'd give it a 3 out of 10  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not expecting too much out of a movie about a man on a quest for answers. I didn't even expect that it would be this good. I thought I was going to be disappointed. I was a bit annoyed when they asked me to take off my jacket, which of course I couldn't. My hands were too cold. The scenery was beautiful. I felt like I was in a dream. I don't even know where to start. I watched it at first because it was a very fast paced film, and I felt I needed to get out of the theater fast. It just kept going, like a roller coaster. My first thought when the credits rolled was that this is the kind of movie that could be made if you put together a group of great actors and directors.   I had the pleasure of working with a great group of people on this movie. I saw this with my best friends. They took their time in the editing room, and we spent a lot of time sitting around watching the movie.      This is a very entertaining movie. The dialogue is good. There are a lot funny lines. It is easy to follow the plot line. The movie is great to watch and it's entertaining to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . I haven't seen the original movie.   "The French Connection" was in 1976.  What else are you going to do with this?   There's a pretty young female character who is a drug dealer and who has a lot of sex.  She also has a good job at a bank (or something).   I had seen this movie once or twice when it was first released but never liked it.  There was an awful lot of violence in this one and I felt a little uncomfortable at some of it. It reminded me a little of "Dirty Harry".   The ending was really good.  I'm sure a lot more people than I will enjoy this one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie reminds me of the old time radio dramas about a family living at a small farm. The father is a tough old farmer, a true cowboy. The mom is a beautiful, but weak looking woman who is overprotective of her husband. The daughter has an attitude and is a bit of a spoiled brat. The kids have a little temper and some mean attitudes but the parents teach them the right way to handle themselves in a real tough farm environment. I'd like to see this movie again.

It's pretty simple and I don't want to spoil the entire movie.  But you must see it to understand the whole movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this movie is made to a classic, yet it is a very enjoyable and good movie. The movie takes place in a place called "The Lost City", which the legend says is a place where all the people who have passed away are transported. However, there is no proof about this and the place is very dangerous. There are many strange creatures around and a group of brave people are searching for the "lost city" all the way with the help of the mysterious and friendly witch (that is a part of the legend and not a part to the movie). After all this, the movie finishes with a very nice ending.   I recommend this movie and to all those who loves a good story and a nice movie: Watch this movie.

Suddenly, the woman who he loved and married is alive again! The couple is very happy! The two have two children (who are almost identical) and the mother looks much better than she did when her husband died.   The movie does not start too well.

The father has an old motorcycle and travels around Japan looking for his daughter by using a map to find her. It's pretty long, but it's great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I think this film is great. It's an incredible piece of filmmaking and the characters are excellent."   - Michael Keaton The original version of this film that was produced in 1959 is not an easy watch at all and for a short film it's absolutely superb.   The director, Rod Serling, knows what he is doing in that he keeps his audience in a state of constant suspense while his story unfolds.  The story is set in the town of Mombasa, Africa.  When I first saw this movie my jaw was on the floor and the thought of doing this short film for the rest of my life just left a bad taste in my mouth.  To be perfectly honest I still can't watch this movie without going into some kind of a trance.  It's very interesting, suspenseful and really well written.  I'm giving a four-and-a-half-star rating to this short documentary.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really don't know where to start with this one.   A good comedy movie, in fact this movie is a pretty funny one. The writing is pretty good too, there are some funny bits, and some really good lines.  At the start, there is a guy who is having a party at his place, but he has a problem. He is an asshole! You see this guy is a big shot, he runs the local news station. I think he is good at what he does but he is also a bad ass.  He is also very insecure about himself. I could relate to his attitude but I also think I could be like him! He is still very insecure though, and there is another girl who loves him.  The girl is an aspiring singer, so she is a very attractive and pretty girl.  This is also her first movie.  You see she is trying to make a name for herself, and she does a good job at it.  And then you have the other party girl, she is not a good singer, but she is hot and the others find her sexy.  It is a good mix of comedy and romance.  If you like any kind of comedy, this is a fun movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is pretty simple: a kid, whose mother, who he lives with, is having an affair with a famous painter, who is on a vacation in India. As his mother goes to meet him she discovers that she is not the only person he has cheated with, and he has to go on an awkward trip to India to try to find out why. The movie is set in India and features a cast of Indians, including a bollywood singer. The performances are good. The art is good as well, although the painting looks very bad. The film is full of stereotypes and jokes, although some of them are pretty funny. It does have some good songs, although I don't think the movie really knows how to use them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I watched this movie last night. I have not seen the first film in this series and found this movie to be a decent enough thriller that not everyone will like. However, I would recommend this movie and to a great extent as a psychological thriller. The movie was great in that a group of people are locked in a small room with only a television and no food or water. Then all of a sudden, a little girl comes in with a gun. We all know that the only way out is to shoot the little girl, but before we can do that, she makes one last statement. She says, "My name is Alice." And that is the only thing the little lady said in this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My only concern, I feel that the film lacks the dramatic tension that makes so great a thriller. There are several close encounters, most of which take place in small rooms or areas that are out of the way. The only close-ups, where the actor's face appears for a second or two before the camera shifts away, are of the camera. This is not surprising, but the film is not built to a climax in any way; as a matter of fact, it lacks a strong beginning and a strong end. I wish that the movie would have had more impact from the beginning and have been more interesting in its action and character development throughout.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What is this movie about?  It's a really good film about a group of girls (and one of the boys) who are going to a big concert called "Honey" (the lyrics include "I'm Honey, you're Honey, we're Honey" ). There is a girl called Sigrid who is the leader of the group. She is in love with a boy called Paul, who has a big crush on her (I think this is a reference to a real boy who went missing in the past). After the concert, Paul is killed (by a woman in the group) and Sigrd decides to find a replacement for Paul. Paul is still a boy and does not belong to her (except for the fact that she doesn't like him), but she is willing to give him a chance. And if a girl doesn't want to be with a guy who has big problems with other people, I guess that's the price of admission... But what happens if you want to find out about the real Paul... I don't remember the names of any of the other characters, but the director is trying to make it very interesting to see what happens to these girls in this music hall of the 1970's.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film follows the lives of three boys and their families in the small town of Springdale, Arkansas. It depicts the lives we all lead here. I was glad to see some of the locals in the film.   This film is about a boy with a bad reputation, who gets caught in the crossfire between the gangs of the area. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.   A fun movie that has a great story, good acting, a good soundtrack and a good plot!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have not seen the original Rocky Horror Picture Show, but I have seen the remake several times and I would have to say that it is really the best Rocky Horror movie. The new movie is an interesting take on the story and has some good jokes in it. The costumes are nice and the acting is very good. I think the story is a bit silly but it is a lot of fun to watch and I think it will be a hit with the younger crowd.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this when I was at a small independent movie theatre in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I did not get too far into it, as I was bored by the beginning, but the end was a little good. I think this movie is best when you get it when it is at the right age.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been watching a lot of sci-fi lately and this is one of my faves.   For starters, I'd like to preface this review by saying that this is a well-done film.  While the story may be simplistic, it is still pretty good.  A good example is the way the aliens interact with human beings. They appear almost as though they have taken over the world in a way that is almost laughable. They have been a part of humans' lives for such a long time and they haven't learned anything except to mess with humans.  They are smart enough to know that they cannot compete with us.  When I first saw it, I wasn't much impressed, but after that first viewing I saw why people like it.  I'm not sure if this movie is for everyone but if you're a fan of sci fi, I think it is a really good time.  The plot is pretty simple and the acting is very good. I didn't expect to like all of the alien characters.  Of the aliens, the Tardis was my favorite and I think the way it was portrayed is fantastic.  This was also a good ending to a story that I really liked.  If you're looking for a good sci fi movie, this is probably the best one you can find. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to say that I loved this movie.   From the first minute of the movie I was like "This is really going to be a great movie!"   It got better and better from there on out.  This movie is definitely a must see!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, my friend and I were out of town this past weekend. We didn't have to work the next day so we went to a movie. This movie is pretty much exactly what the title says. It's like, a black and white film about a young man who moves to the country and doesn't think that he's ready to live out his dreams of being a cowboy. I wouldn't say it's bad, but it's not that great. And, it's almost too weird to be funny. It just seems like it was made by a college student (he must have been a good looking one) and it's like a little joke about being a rural country boy. He keeps talking about how if you have to kill a buffalo, you have no problem doing it. He also talks about how he can't have sex with girls because he's a virgin. So basically he is a gay cowboy who keeps thinking about killing a buffalo (probably with a knife), but it never comes to that. Also, there is a girl at the end, so that wasn't really a funny thing. I didn't mind the movie, it wasn't bad. I do wish I hadn't gone out of my way to go see it because I was going to be thinking about it all weekend (and to be honest, thinking about something for a week is bad). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My brother, who's a professional film maker and who has made movies for over thirty years, has a little over 100 movies for me to watch. He's a very kind-hearted man and I'm sure a nice person to be around. If you like his movies, then I highly recommend you give the following a try. It's a comedy, but it has a plot to it. You see a poor girl who has a job, but no one's coming to pay her. A friend comes to stay with her and they're both happy for a while. After that, they go on a vacation, and I think the two go out to dinner at a famous restaurant. But what should happen, but the waiter, who is in fact a waiter and has come up there for the job. He takes the money and then they leave. Well, the waiter tells her that it's not a good thing, that he will never get another job, and they have to run and find a place to stay. But the two are both sad. They realize that they are stuck in a dead-end job, that it means they can't buy something they need.   So they go out and look for jobs. The two find a hotel that is looking for two more people. They go in and then find a guy who has been given the job by the owner to run it. He is a nice guy and very nice to the two, and then he makes the two very happy. He also makes them happy because he puts on a great show and the two enjoy the show. Then he makes them even happier when he makes a huge pot of coffee and they enjoy their coffee. Then the two realize he's been drinking it for three hours.  This poor girl has been working a bad job and is very frustrated. She wants out.  The two get rid of the waiter and try to go back home. But it's raining hard and the girl finds herself wet. The guy shows up to help her out of the rain.  Now the two leave the hotel and try looking for a place that's more inviting. They get some help from a taxi driver who has the keys to the building that they're in, and the woman decides to let him drive her home.  When they get home they find that they've had a very bad day, and one of them feels a bit lonely and so they go and take a walk.  They've also found a place
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have heard a lot about this movie but never really got around to watching it until I read a review about it on MST3k.   The movie is about a small town that has a problem with one of their high school students.  He has a habit of stealing things like his teacher's hat, and sometimes, just stealing.  The police in the town put out a search, and this kid doesn't show up. The townsfolk then try to solve the mystery and the police suspect that this kid has some supernatural power.  They send out a kid to search for him and a search party of teenagers.  When the party finds him they find that he is not as easy to find as the police say.  Then they try to get him into custody, but a lot of things about him don't add up.  A search party is formed to find him.  You could be right here.  What is this about.  It's about a kid that gets caught and is tried and given a sentence. He does not take it well.  Instead of going to prison, he steals and gets away.  I'm not saying it was a good comedy, but I was entertained for the most part.  Not sure I could recommend this movie to any person because I did not find it to be all that entertaining, but it's a fun movie that I will definitely watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best movie I have ever seen. In the beginning, I thought it was gonna be very hard to watch as I had watched "Killing Jesus" before and this is much more like "Kilby's Christmas". It makes me remember all those years when I was a little kid and we all played and played and then we played in our rooms. So when we got out of the house to go to the school I went over to the play house and they were still playing. And a big old Christmas tree was hanging there but they had not even put any lights on. They were just standing around the whole time and they played "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star". I did not like the way they put Christmas lights all over the walls and everything.   After awhile I got tired of playing and then I went to my room and I went under my bed and I found all my toys and I started playing with them.  And then one of my toys just fell on me. I said "Oh! that's a little teddy bear" and so I ran down under the bed and that's when I saw my teddy. So I started to get into a game of tickling this teddy and then this little baby came out of a toy box.  I said, "Is this a girl or a boy?" and it looked like a girl. And I tickled it, and it cried a lot.  Then I ran away and that is when I heard this little voice come out of my tinnie. I told him, "I want you to go with me to the store."  And I never heard him again.  It was a real nice thing to see all those toys and all those Christmas lights.  After I got my teddies I ran over and said, 'Hi'. He said, ``Well, why didn't you say hello to me?" And I said because the lights were on.  This movie is much like "Pineapple Express".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a very good movie, with a story that was believable and it really made you feel like you were in a good story. It had all the things that i like in a movie: the sound, the plot, the characters.   A good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've heard that "The Wizard of Oz" was the greatest movie of all time, and now I know I was right. The book by L. Frank Baum is not only one of the best books ever written, but a great movie. The soundtrack is very beautiful, with one of my favorite songs, "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ" by "Groucho Marx." I don't think I'll ever watch a movie this great ever again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like any other good movie with good acting, good story and very original characters,   it makes you feel good as a good guy.   One of those movies that you would like, not because it's good, but because it gives you some fun times and good laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I finally got to see this movie.     I am a big fan of both Stephen King and Jodie Foster.  This movie is both of these things.  I was pretty excited when I saw it, and I loved the movie!   It is very creepy in a good way, but there were some parts that are a little scary too.  For instance, when the girl was being murdered and there was an axe lying beside her, it was pretty scary, but the movie didn't really do a great job of showing that.  It was scary but not really in a creepy way.  The movie was very well made, it had some creepy scenes but I think they did a better job than they did in the book.   Also, there are some pretty bad scenes in this movie, and the acting wasn't that great.  But overall, I loved this movie! I was surprised when I got it home and I thought it was a lot of fun! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A solid, well thought out movie, that I found to be very interesting.   One word of warning:  If you can't stand action, this one is not for you.  If for some reason you can deal with this, then you will enjoy this one, but beware.  This is one of those movies that is good for the "kids."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As soon as I watched this movie I could tell that this is a movie with a clear plot and an original story. It makes me think of a movie like "The Crow," but that's not a bad thing.   This is a good horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An extremely good comedy about a man who has lost his son, and now, he gets revenge by having his son's ex girlfriend kill her ex-boyfriend, and then getting married to the ex-girlfriend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a woman and her two friends. She was raised by her mommy in a very strict way. Her mommy teaches her bad manners, to respect the elders and not to talk when the father is not looking. After all her chores, she has to go to a church. In the church she meet a man and they fall in love. Then she meets another man and is attracted to him. They go to the beach and she has an accident and her friend has to take her to the hospital. It is not a nice thing but the girl recovers and they meet other people. In this movie they are happy and have fun.    The other thing that I liked was that the movie is quite romantic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In terms of a movie that was not only very interesting but also not only good but also very enjoyable, a bit like watching a good story being told in a good way by a well crafted good actor.   This is very different from a movie like The Lord of the Rings.  Also it is not an original movie, but it was good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an absolute sucker for a good adventure movie and I am a big fan of the Indiana Jones series. So of course I picked this one up to see the latest installment.   This movie is just a little over two hours long and it's hard to keep track of all of the characters and their actions throughout the movie.  As the plot goes on though, the movie becomes a bit less about saving the world and more about how we are all going to die.  That's all fine and well but it's just not that much of a change for the series.  The movie looks great with great effects and it has plenty of action.  If you are a fan of these characters then I really would recommend this to you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to rate a movie like this, but a bit too hard.   I don't really understand what is the point in the film? Is the girl getting some sex? Why is the girl trying to escape? Are the police chasing her? Why did he make the phone call?   The only thing I can think of is that if you don't like to be watched with your eyes, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good sci-fi action movie with a lot of action.   I was shocked how strong the action sequences were.  I think that this movie had a strong cast of actors and I was just amazed by the way they played them out.  One thing that I like about this movie was that it was one where we got to see the aliens as much as the humans.  This was great.  The aliens were very different looking.  It is interesting that we see an alien with a human's face (as opposed to a monkey's).   Another thing I liked was that they showed us humans' perspective of the aliens (as the aliens did not speak to us in the film).  My favourite moment is when we get to see a face-to-face with one of the alien's and we learn about them.  If you like action movies this movie is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is the best movie I have seen in the last 10 years, and I have been watching alot of them. I think the film gets into some interesting subject and there are no filler scenes or anything. I love the movie because of the way the director used his time to make the movie something that is well executed, although I will say there were a few parts I did not enjoy, such as the scene with the young boy. I guess he is the only one who gets an easy ride because of his age and he is always getting the crap beat out of him, he just wants to have fun. I do not think he is a kid he is atleast 14. I have a few of the movie posters. One of them is the man who is running the business and one is the young girl, and one of them the boy who is never with them at the time, but you can guess where the movie goes from there. I did get a kick out of the ending, and the movie was fun to watch. I also think the actors who were in it were great. I thought the director did a good job with the movie. I hope that you go see this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well this movie is about a high school girl named Yuna who is going to Japan and has a lot of problems with her family and friends, because they are all too lazy to care about Yuna at all. But then a big boy named Haruki arrives and tells her about Japan. Haruki is a beautiful boy, but he is just an average teenager.   So then she wants to leave Japan, but Haruki tells her it is too late to go back, because now everyone has to live the life he wants to live. But this girl has so much in her mind she can't even put it in words. She is in such a hurry to go away and just leave everything behind that she doesn't even know what she wants in her life.  It is so sad, because Yuna is not only a beautiful and talented young woman, she is also very caring and honest. In fact I think she is the only true friend in this entire movie.  And now I want to say that I like this movie. It is an original anime movie that is very funny and has its heart in the right place.  At one point in the movie Yuna goes to see a movie at the movie theater and she is totally excited about it, but when she leaves she finds that the theater is already packed. Well that is because of Yuna, because she just has to go and see this movie, without anyone stopping her.  This movie is great, I was just so happy to see this anime movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie before in its original, uncut, "uncensored" form.   For a while, I was considering doing a second watch on this version;   After a year or two (maybe more), I've finally seen it.  At least for me, it's the same movie as the one that I saw when I was 12.  I like the way they made it:  I found the dialogue a bit funny, the acting a bit flat, the effects a bit over the top.  While I don't necessarily love or hate this movie, I enjoyed the experience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the most important aspect of this movie is the relationship between the three main characters.   The only problem I had with this movie was that I wish that the story had been expanded a little more so that I could have found out more about the real story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much. It is very realistic. The characters are really likeable and likable. There are a lot of sex scenes and I'm not a big fan of the two girls (I thought they were too pretty to be in a movie). I'd rather the movie focus more on the guy. The story takes a while to develop. I think the movie is more for those guys that like to watch a good hard-core porn and a really good story behind it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is very funny and interesting. There are a couple of things that make the movie good, but it's very funny so the movie gets to be pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Black Dahlia is a rare example of what happens when a film director is allowed to take chances, and when a star gets in on the act. At the beginning of the film, when we meet the film's protagonist, she has a few things going on. First, she is just as pretty as the title, so naturally we are going to assume she has to be a super model. The problem with this assumption is that she has absolutely no sense of style; and her only clue to her own attractiveness is the way that she constantly pulls her hair back with her hand and keeps moving it up and down. What's more, the people who are supposed to look after her seem totally unaware of this. When a pretty woman like this leaves home to go dancing at a club, how can anybody tell if she is actually attractive?"     The story begins with the main character driving a taxi with her boyfriend in New York. It seems that she is the only driver available in the city, so her boyfriend decides to hitch a ride with a local woman named Rita, a waitress at a nightclub. They arrive at the club and find that the bouncers have turned it into a "no dancing" zone. This does not sit well with the two drivers, so they head out to the car park. As they drive along a road, they get a little close to an attractive blonde who is apparently having a little trouble finding a place to park her car. As the driver notices this, she begins to put her foot down on the gas pedal and she takes the lead, driving off the road. As she accelerates, the wheels of her car go skidding across the road, and the taxi suddenly comes to a halt. The car then spins in a 360 degree loop on top of the road before crashing into a parked car. Rita is then thrown from the car, and then the taxi itself flies off the highway, and it crashes into a tree. Her boyfriend is thrown out, but it's her and the cab which has crashed. The driver of the taxi is badly hurt, and his legs have been broken. The taxi driver is thrown to the ground and he dies. The other passengers on the taxi die, and so do the driver's boyfriend and the people from the club.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I'm a HUGE fan of The Mummy franchise and was really excited about The Mummies. I think the first movie is great and I loved it. I'm not going to say anything bad about it, as I don't want to spoil anything, but I do think there's something missing from the story. It's like they are trying to do too much, and I thought that there were too many people in the movie that really didn't add anything. That is what I think is wrong about The Incredibles. It had so many things going for it, but the main issue is I don in fact think the movie needed more. As far as I'm concerned, that is the main problem with the first film in The Mummies trilogy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a long time I didn't like the first Godzilla movie. I thought it was way too similar to the original Japanese Godzilla. I wasn't even into Japanese movies that had Godzilla. But then, while watching the TV series, I decided to watch this movie. When I was done I was disappointed. I mean, the first act was bad. It reminded me of the original one way too much. It was a little too goofy and the plot was pretty lame. I wouldn't call this a good Godzilla movie, but I was hoping for a little better.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (3/4 stars)   The only reason I can say it was great was because of how beautiful the movie was in its entirety. In a small theater in Portland, Oregon, a family of four lives their own little little existence. They have a dog and a cat. They enjoy the small town feel. At the time, it was the perfect place to do it. But then things started getting weird. The house was built to look like the house that the cat used to live in (it's just the house now, but it looks like the cat's.) The cat would come to a lot of fun places at night with a bag of kitty litter (like a big bag of litter.) When the cat went out, the house would be completely empty. The family would go out in the middle of the night to look for it, and the house was always the same, empty. (It looked like an abandoned house.) The children didn't like it, but they did what they could, and still enjoyed the small towns, so they got used to it. Eventually, they were going to have to move because of a nasty, abusive husband. They decided to get a new place, a real house in a bigger place, but the people who bought it would not let them do it because of the cats. They tried to get the dogs out of the new house so they could have cats, but no luck. The new house would not have any dogs. The children were desperate, and they decided to take the cats with them. The cats never would leave the cat house, even though they could see the big dogs walking around in the new place. The last straw was when the man who was living in the house told the children that he never wanted the cats in the same house with them anymore. He was scared that they would get hurt. The kids weren't ready to move. The cat house got a good cleaning, but was so sad. But at least it was gone, so the children could get to know their new house.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Waco Story" is a movie about the siege of the Waco, Texas Branch Davidian compound. The movie is loosely based on the book "Fool for Love," written by David Koresh (d.1992). In the beginning the film shows the tragedy that befell the compound. As we can see, the FBI agent, Gary Powers, and the deputy, Bill Clark, were killed in the fire. In the movie we also get to know the wife, who left the compound a few weeks before the fire and was captured by the FBI. The story is about the standoff at the compound, in which the FBI was trying to arrest Koresh and his followers. This standoff ended with a battle between the FBI and the Davidians. This battle is shown as a battle by the Davidian's with the FBI, who were trying to capture the Davidists in the middle of a forest. As the battle ends the FBI were not happy with what they saw as a terrorist attack. The siege ended and a number of people were killed including the David's son, who was just 12 years old at the time. The film shows scenes from the siege, including the FBI's arrival at the base of the building where the Davidis were holed up, and how the FBI had to wait for four months for them to surrender. The battle at the Davidisk and the story of the siege itself is shown. The Davidis also have the chance to have a couple of children and we get to see the Davidi and some of their children have a child and we see some of the things that the David, children, and families go through. Also, we get a chance to see some Davidi kids and we meet a young Davidi, David, who has a lot of anger, hatred, and anger in him. We also get a lot to see about a few members of the Davidist cult, which we learn are followers of David Kore Shindler, who is not really a cult leader, but is a cult member. The most important thing about the movie is the story. It is a good story about an important, but controversial, event in our history, the siege at the Wacos.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a film that i'm sure most of us who like sci-fi and space movies like to watch, a good sci-fis film, and one that's fun to watch.   The story revolves around a space explorer who is sent to find a planet with a strange creature living on it, it's called an insectoid or insect like being and they appear and attack him.  But he learns that it has something to do with some other planet and that there are two races there that are the good people who don't kill or do any harm to the bugs that come out of the earth and the bad people who kill all the bugs if they find them.  Then as time goes by the bug or insectoid people start to attack him again and his attempts to find the aliens that will help him to find his friend who has been captured by the bugs.  This film is a fun sci-Fi film, a little silly, but it's fun, and a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a lot of the characters in this movie. They are very likable. The bad guy, Mr. Fiske, is pretty annoying though. He seems to be the only one who doesn't have any clue what he's doing.   A bit too long for the price I paid. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like any good action movie, the climax, in which they battle a giant robot, was very satisfying.   It's great that they are able to fight this giant robot so quickly because it's just amazing how well the effects and CGI in this movie work.  One of my favorite movies:  I'll probably have to go see it again a few times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, the movie's really good! I was expecting to see the ending, I had a good feeling about the movie and I was really looking forward to see what the story would be. I had no idea that it was going to be this good! It's not a good sci-fi movie in terms of the action, but if you want a good, funny sci-fis movie that will make you smile, then this movie is good! The acting is good, but not outstanding. The plot is fun and you can see that this is a parody, but I think it's a better parody than the other comedies that have been done. I've always been impressed with the concept of a comedy movie that uses a good science fiction story to make fun of our current society. If you are a fan of satire films or want to watch a good one with good acting, I'd say this is worth a look.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like horror and you haven't seen it yet...go watch this!   I watched it before I saw I Am Legend...and now I see I Am Legion and I Am In Love with It!  It's just fun to watch and I really liked how the cast kept it real.   It was my first horror movie and I loved it!  I'm sure my kids will love it as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a real old fashioned movie that will probably not be able to compete with some of the big budgeted Hollywood movies out there. There are no explosions or anything like that, but this is a movie that I enjoyed. I enjoyed the story, I enjoyed how it was done, and I enjoyed that they used real old school people to put the movie together.   "It is time for another party.  I am not going to bother you any longer with the explanations of my name, I am just going to tell you a little story of a long time ago and a certain big white beast who made me a boy and who made a little boy out of me.  And I am not really sure that I will ever know where I came from or where I am going."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I'm reviewing is called 'Dawn of the Dead'. It is a good example of a horror movie with a little gore thrown in.  The film has an extremely cool atmosphere and you can see why this movie had such a huge cult following in its day. It has a great mix of gore, gore porn and some creepy shots of a dead person's face. The film starts with a group of young people from a small New England town in a small truck. They are headed for a big city they want to go to in a big truck. In the truck, they all get a phone call from a guy named Dale. He tells them that a couple of men who were drinking in a bar got killed by a group who had just gone in and murdered all the victims. Dale and a couple others then go on a murder spree. The movie is told from the perspective of Dale who is in the first group that goes in. The rest of the crew that have to do the job are the other survivors who are picked off one by one by Dale. We follow Dale as he gets into the truck and heads to the bar. The scene is mostly shot from Dale's perspective. He has a little trouble making his way up the street and has to stop to ask a man for directions. He then gets a call that a truckload of people have just arrived at the bar and that they are all dead and that the people in the truck are hiding from Dale. Dale thinks it is just a small incident until he gets a glimpse of the people who are hiding. They look exactly like the people he killed in the bar! The people in Dale's truck are actually dead people! The camera zooms out to Dale's POV, we are in his POV. He watches as a guy falls over. Dale gets out of his truck, takes the guy's head out of the wall, places it on his shoulder and gets in his truck. Dale heads to a house that has a big TV and sees a man. Dale approaches the guy and then he notices a TV. Dale puts the guy in a coffin and takes him into the house. The next thing you know, there is a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. This guy is dead! And the guys in Dale' truck are also dead. Dale finds the TV in the house and goes inside. Inside there is some TV shows, a movie on the TV and some books. This was a little confusing for me at first
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw a good little movie, a good old, traditional Irish flick. A very good, and very old film. It had a strong character, and a good plot. It was very good entertainment, very Irish, very nice. It also had an end, and some nice moments, the ending was a bit slow, but it was also very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a young boy, I loved a lot of movies, both from the Disney/Pixar/RKO films and the movies made by Steven Spielberg.   But I must admit that I've always found the Spielberg films to be quite bland and boring.  After seeing this film I really got a kick out of it, because I loved it so much it almost made me forget about the dull Spielberg films.  One of the things I noticed was that Spielberg was quite well cast in this movie.  While many of his films have been highly successful, his best work has been done in comedies.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the amount of laughs he was able to produce in this film.  When you are watching a Spielberg film you expect a lot from them.  This film shows just why they are so successful.  What I liked the most about this movie, was that it was a bit on the sentimental side.  There are scenes of good old fashioned country folks and of course, the usual Spielberg clichés that he so loves to use.  These scenes were also funny.  But the best part was watching Steve Buscemi play the role of the sheriff, even though he is a somewhat unlikable character.  Spielberg has said that he loves the movie "because it reminds me of when I was an adolescent".  I would agree.  If you enjoy a good old fashion romance then I would suggest this to you.  And a lot to be grateful for.  A must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie.  It really was the one movie I got to see on opening day at the movie theater.  The characters were all likable.   The movie was not perfect but it had a good story.  My favorite characters were J.D. and Mr. B.C.  I felt that the movie gave us a good insight into what Mr. Big and Mr Big C were like.  And I enjoyed the ending too.  This movie was a good lesson on how a man can be a man.  This movie could have been called:  " The Story of J. D. and J. B."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    " I just watched the last episode of Dexter. Now I'm wondering how I missed the entire season of Dexter the first time around. I loved the show and I loved Dexter so much. I'm not sure why I didn't pick up a copy for years until I saw the DVD box set on ebay. I bought it for the first season and I absolutely loved it. Dexter is so much fun! It had this old-school cool that people were wearing in the 80's, but the show had new-age cool and it really works. The writing was really witty and witty. There was this moment where he told an amazing story about a kid who had a crush on him because he could talk to his mom about things like, "The sun is yellow." And he then told the story and then he said "The sky is blue." It's like a story about Dexter. So awesome. So funny. So witty. So interesting. So cool. It was great. "  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a must see, and a great movie all the way through. From the start we are shown the life of the two men that play a vital part of the story, one of which has been in prison for many years, the other of whom is a hero. The story is set in the mid 1800's where a man is sent to prison for killing a man, and his daughter, a young woman who is now a widow is sent back into the prison to help him with his books. The plot takes off and there are many twists and turns to be expected, all of which are nicely handled by the actors and the writers.   There is no real comedy in this movie, however the two actors are very good, the direction is good, and the action scenes are pretty good as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love movies like this because I love a good horror film.   It has a very good sense of humor, but it's not overly campy.  It's not scary, but the characters do have a certain amount of charm to them.  I thought it was a good film because it didn't take itself too seriously.  As far as the acting goes, I thought all of them were very well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great film.   The acting and dialogue are good and well done.  The story line is a lot better then a lot of other westerns which I don't know why.  It's about a young boy who has to go on a dangerous trip.  In addition to the adventure there are some good laughs and a good story.  My only problem with the film is that it is very long.  There are a lot more plot lines in this film that are left unsaid and they end up being pretty boring.  For the price I paid for this, I expect more of a story line and a more exciting action scene.  But overall I can't really find anything bad about this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw a lot of bad movies in high school.  The last movie I saw was  Curse of Chucky.   It was just a bad movie.  My father loved that movie, and he saw it a bunch of times.  There was a scene in it that made my father really mad.  He said, "I was always afraid of that child.  It's like it's trying to get my mind.  You can do a lot with it, just a big dumb kid who can't be killed."  My mother was always on the lookout for a movie to put on in the living room while I watched cartoons in the evening.  That's how I got into  Freddy Krueger.  I got it from my father and I saw it several times before I could go to sleep.     I'm so glad my father made the choice to let me watch it as a kid.  A lot of other films in the same vein were shown to us by the school's theater company.  At a young age, my father would take me and my brother and watch them.  When we were around 10 years old, we would see a lot.  We had this one movie in particular,  Freddy's Dead:  A Nightmare on Elm Street.  This was a horrible movie. My favorite movie was  Halloween  which was actually a TV show.  Halloween was better.  If you watch the TV show, you can understand why my father was so angry with it.  Now, I have watched all the films I wanted to watch.  One of the films that I never got to see was The Stetchone's.  They had this big budgeted movie,   which didn't get me very excited.  But, it was really well made.  Like it said on the box,  "What's the difference between the dreamworld and the real world?"  In my opinion, the dream world is just another world that we're always looking at, it's not something we're experiencing.  On the other hand, the real life is very dangerous.   I can't stress enough that watching a bad film as a child is not something you want to do.  Especially, if your parents tell you that the movie is not good.  As a result of me watching those bad films as a children, I now look at my favorite films with a much darker, deeper sense of
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The whole thing is so stupid and I just want to see a film about a little old lady who has a big old house and who tries to put all her stuff into the attic so she can have a clean place to live. And she has a pet squirrel but she has no clue what to do with it."   - I got this in a video rental and was just about to give up when I discovered that it could be turned into a movie. I guess the studio got tired of their success in films about big redheaded ladies who don't know what to call themselves.   I was not disappointed at all, I could not believe the studio would not just make a film of this book. It has some real gems in it and is great fun to see these characters interacting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I went to see it this evening at a local theater. We were given a head start, as it was at the house of an old friend who had shown it at his house some years back. There was a bit of a crowd at the screening as we had been there before and it was very nice to be able to get a bit more of the experience. There were so many different kinds of people there that you didn't feel like there was a stereotype of what a cowboy was all about. There are some good movies I have seen this year, so I'm glad I had a chance to see this one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoy this movie. It is very good. I have always liked the movies about a madman (Madrigal is one of my favorite movies and this one is very similar) that lives on a farm and loves to draw and do weird things. I think he has a weird and silly personality but he makes very funny and fun movies and it is a shame that the people he hates most are usually the ones who come to his house (the farmers) to make fun of his crazy drawings. The plot is a bit ridiculous but it gets good at the end. I liked the fact that the farm was very funny.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I've said, the first ten minutes are kinda strange and somewhat confusing, with weird effects, like giant spiders. Then the "man" is introduced, a rather creepy looking fellow who can turn into an animal. When the creatures start attacking people (I don't know if it's the evil man or not) the only way to get the creatures away from a city is to destroy all the trees, thus making the city disappear (because the trees also are part of the forest). The people are getting more and more insane and crazy, the more they destroy the trees. The creatures get more and are more powerful.   The end is a bit too weird, there's no reason why the trees shouldn't just go away, why the creatures shouldn't destroy the cities and why humans should live in a small town.  It was all a bit silly, but for what it's worth, I had a fun time watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a kid growing up in the 1970's, this was one of my all time favorite movies. I'm so happy this film was released in its original cut as opposed to its current cut. I don't know why but this film is one of the most memorable films of all time.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this one. The plot is a lot like that of the original. The only difference is the characters are different and the humor is not that far removed from the original material. If you liked the original, you'll like this one more than the original since the plot has less "creativity" than the earlier film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (7/10) I didn't find this movie as funny as I was hoping to, and I wasn't impressed by the acting either. However, the story and acting were pretty good. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good comedy with a twist at the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there are two reasons to watch this movie, then the first would be to appreciate the acting and visual effects. The second would be that it's a movie about a very boring and stereotypical love story, which doesn't even have enough moments for two.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not know about The Haunting before going to the cinema but it was so creepy that I will be going there again to see it for sure.   The acting was great and it was not like the acting of the classic films of the 70's where you could see your character through the eyes of a child. This is very different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoy my writing then you should be pleased to see that the original title of The Dead Poets Society, The Dead Philosophers Society, was changed to The Dead Man's Society.   This movie was not bad, the movie was very funny, there was a lot of drama, and the plot was simple but the movie still had a lot to offer.   The main characters were all played by a few different actors and they were all very different from one another.  One of the actors played a very different type of person from the others and that is the reason why you could tell what type of man he really was. The movie started out with a very simple scene that had a very obvious plot and when I first saw it I was just going to find out what all the fuss was about.  The story of The Death of Socrates did not have much to offer, but it did it's job.  I do not think that this movie was made with a whole lot of care and it did not take much to make it seem like a pretty good movie.  With all of the action going on, the drama was not very strong but it was more than enough to keep me interested.  If I had to rate this movie in two categories I would say it had a little too much action and drama but there was enough humor to keep it interesting.  I was watching this movie with my 9 year old son and we enjoyed it very much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is simple: an American family is travelling by air. When they get to Germany, they get on the wrong plane (where they meet an old friend), and there they encounter a man who is a Nazi. (And a little drunk.) The family is then taken hostage by the Nazi, who tells them that the Jews are plotting to take over the world. The family try to help the old friend. In the meantime, the Nazis are on a killing spree, bombing all the Jewish buildings, killing Jews and Russians. All the while, they are trying to get the old family to join them, which they can only do through one of their own children who is Jewish. It's a slow and dull plot. But it is full of action and laughs, with enough romance in between to keep you interested. The acting is solid, but nothing exceptional. The music was the only redeeming part. (I liked the theme song more than the movie) And the acting was good enough to get through it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a girl, Rachael (Kimberly Ann Harris), who has been raised by her mother to be a woman of a strict order who does not have any hobbies. As a little girl, she enjoyed dancing and singing as did her friends, but she was never one of their favorites and the adults used to call her a brat. When she turns eight she finally gets to be the center of attention and gets a job working with the other women on a factory and the men go out to dance and drink and smoke and they forget about the women. This film is an example of the good life for women in the 20th Century. The characters are quite nice and the actors were good but the movie was not bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun and well made action movie about a special ops man who has to rescue the world from a space ship that crash lands on earth. It has some good humor, and some great fight scenes. The special ops guy is pretty cool, he does everything with a smile. He gets all the girls, and his mission to save the world seems to be an everyday thing. The action scenes are very good and the special ops guys are cool. The plot could be improved if they made the girl a little less annoying, but it still a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll admit, when I saw the trailer, I didn't like the movie. It's just an adaptation of a short story about an author who travels to a place called Paradise, but instead of being happy about being away from humanity, he finds a town full of idiots who don't know what to do with their lives, and instead of making people happy with a book, he makes them miserable by forcing his characters to live out their lives by the book. Well, not a bad adaptation. It certainly has its own charm and charm it has a great cast of characters. There isn't much that's different, in fact, the book is an even better story than the movie, so there's really nothing that's missing. It isn't a bad film, I'm just disappointed by the adaptation.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was impressed with "The Hateful Eight," although I did have my reservations about the whole thing.   The Hateful 8 is a Western, but it is certainly not a "honest" Western.  The characters are all "bad" people, and the bad guys are not the heroes (as they were in "Gone With the Wind," or as they are in "Rio Bravo," or even as they were, for that matter, in "It's a Wonderful Life").   A great deal of the action is taken at night, and you will see characters doing crazy stuff and making a nuisance of themselves.  I do think that the movie would be better if the camera had not been so good.  While it does get you to have your nose stuck to the screen, it makes you wonder, "What if I could see the bad men? What if I knew who they were?" It is, indeed, a great tragedy that so many people have to die like that, and that is the sad part about it.  It is interesting to note that many of the actors seem to be friends or neighbors, but they never get to share any screen time together, and even the one character I liked best, the Sheriff, is barely in the movie at all.  Another curious thing about the movie is that it opens with the same sequence, the same theme, and it seems to be getting a bit boring, so the movie has to go to a more interesting place.  However, the movie works, and I did like it. I am glad that it came out this week. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen the trailers. They all look like a little kid's game of pretend. I would think it was a little more than that, but it was more than I had ever imagined it to be. The action is all done in the style of a film from the 1950's. I wasn't expecting that. This is not the action movie I thought it would be. It's more of a slow, but very good suspense film. There were moments when I just wanted to be in the theater and didn't want to leave until the movie was over. The pacing is great. It builds suspense slowly to a climax. There are some scenes in there that really shocked me. Some are really bad, but that's the way suspense works. I don't mean that as a knock on the director or the actors, because they all did very good jobs. I did not like any of the characters in this movie, because I felt like they all were playing characters from the movie and not really being real. That was not a good thing. It was not enjoyable for me. The movie has a plot that does not go anywhere but just gets better and better. As an audience member, you are never satisfied. The ending is a cliffhanger, but I feel like that ending was always a possibility. I just felt like it was missing. Maybe a sequel? I am sure if this movie was given the chance to be expanded, it would probably end up being pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie in theaters with my friends at a late showing at a theater in New York. This was my first time to see a new release from the director of  The Shining. I am a fan of his movies and like many others, I really enjoyed this movie.   There are many scenes in this movie that have a deep meaning to them.  There is a scene in this film that I think sums up what a movie like this could be like if the director wanted to put a different spin on it.  In the first scene, we see the doctor and the nurses and the patient. The nurse is a sweet old lady who is a loving mother to a sick man, so much so that we get to see the man for a few moments as he is being held by the nurses. It is a beautiful scene and I would never want to be without one of these nurses.  The man is being treated and is in a wheelchair. The nurses, all dressed in white gowns with their white gloves, are in charge of him.  A nurse comes to the man and asks him a question. He says "Yes." and the nurse gives him a big kiss.    Then the nurse turns to the nurse next to the one who kissed the man.  He asks the nurse how long she was working at the hospital. She says "Just a little over a week." Then she gives him an even bigger kiss.  Then the nurses turn to the boy next to them who has the same name as the man next to him,  Robert "Bob" Smith. They say "Robert "Bob Smith" Smith is a good boy who loves us."    The movie starts out with the nurse saying "So Bob, you are going to bed now." The nurse turns and walks out the door as the boy who was the same age as the patient laughs at her.  One of the nurses turns and turns back to the patient as the nurse laughs at the boy. Then the boy asks a question and the woman on the phone answers the question.  She says, "Well Robert, I have no idea where you are from but you look like a very nice boy.  Now as they leave, one of the boy's eyes comes to life and he screams "Bob, Bob, are you ok?   When the boy is screaming Bob tells the nurses to call the police.  They do and the boy looks like a broken person. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Dark Knight" was a great movie. It was very well-made. It took you to a place that is far different from the dark-hearted world Batman finds himself in. The movie has a real sense of humor and it's a good mix of action, horror and comedy. It's a well-directed and well-acted movie and it has a great storyline.   It is a great action movie. Batman has no weapons and he has to rely on his wits to defeat a lot of thugs.  The movie was great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So a new studio made a pretty good movie with pretty good visuals.   This is a movie about a woman that is looking for a boyfriend that is an alcoholic. So, she makes a fake boyfriend for him.  I would like to see a movie like this with an alcoholic lead.  For an alcoholic the movie does a good job at showing that he does a few good things and a few bad things.  The story also does a pretty decent job at introducing the characters and their feelings.  Some of the characters are a little too likeable and some a little not so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good thriller. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little bit scared. I don't like horror movies. But I thought that this movie was very good. Not all that good, but very good, at least the ending was very cool. I like the idea of the killer coming into the house, and killing the family. The killer has a knife, so he may have shot them or stabbed them. Maybe they were all stabbed, but then they died. I liked the idea that this is a little old mansion with little windows. I would go to this house. It's about $12 to go to the movie.

The movie starts with a long slow beginning but the movie is good when it gets going, like many other movies from the 80's like "Nightmare on Elm Street". The cast is decent in this movie.   I remember when I first saw this movie, I thought it was like "The Exorcist" with a girl and a guy (in the movie). Now it's about the guy with the telekinetics that are in love with the girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first saw this movie in a movie theater. I was hooked right away.   " The Legend of Sleepy Hollow " is not a cheap movie.  It's a story of love and loss.  I never had much sympathy for the people who lived in a town called Sleepy and they lived very poor.  They lived in their own little bubble.  For instance, if a child died in the woods, the only people who knew were their parents.  Also there were no churches.  The people were so closed off to the rest of the world that a stranger could go in and live with them, and not only would they give him a bed, but they would even let him come and visit!   This is a story about the death of a young girl named Mabel Pines.  She was a sweet little girl.  While playing a game of tag with a friend a man came up from the woods and tried to steal her.  This was the first sign that something was wrong in Sleepy.  When Mabel was just 9 years old she was found by her dead parents and brought back to life.  After many years Mabel had married another boy and they had two boys.  One son lived in the city. The other lived in one of the big woods.  Mabel and the son lived a quiet life as they waited for a miracle.  Some of their neighbors were worried about the son.  His name was Tom Sawyer.  But Mabel wanted to save the son from the life he was about to lead.  With the help of the witch from another town called the North, Mabel persuaded the boy to leave the boy and come with her to the big city.  Along the way she would get him a job, and then help him find the girl who had once been his sister.  At first Tom Sawyer was happy about being a professional logger. But he soon learned that he could not survive in a city and so he joined the army.  On the road again and again Mabel became the best friend Tom had.  "The Legend of Sleeping Hollow" tells a love story in which everyone loses something. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are so many good movies on here, I was lost. I didn't know what to do with this movie until I started to watch it. I was like a kid when I first saw this. This movie was fun, not too scary and a lot of fun. You can watch it in the dark, in the car or even at a friend's house.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. I liked that it took a few episodes to start revealing it's secrets.   This movie had so many twists and turns, but it also had good actors.  It was about a young boy (Josh Lucas) who lives in a small town, who is obsessed with the old TV show, "The Three Stooges". When he gets older, he goes to the theater to see the play, but when he doesn't get to see it, he decides to try to live like the character that he is playing.  This is a good, but not great film, but a very good one to watch with a young child.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What was the big deal about the movie?   It's a well-made movie, and it is good in every sense of the word, even the stupid one.   This movie is based on the fact that one day an old man comes to the village and starts killing people, so a young boy, named Karel, sets out to kill him.  What I liked about the film was that Karel never was really mean. He never used any violence, only the "bad" things he saw on the TV. So I had a lot of fun watching this movie.  This is a great movie to watch if you want to kill people without being mean, or just enjoy a movie that's based on a true story.  If you want a good comedy with a little violence, then I can't recommend this movie enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a very nice storyline. It gives a nice little look into the life of a homeless man and what it's like to be a man in the street. There is also an amazing scene with the man. This movie is not just good for its storyline but it is a great movie to watch while having a beer.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not the biggest fan of sci-fi, I was really disappointed in this movie, not the best.   Like a lot of people I read the story and was a bit disinterested, but after watching the movie I was hooked.  I love aliens in sci- fi, and this movie has all the elements of a great alien movie.  The movie shows us some cool alien designs.  There are some cool action scenes.  What is amazing about the movie is that there are aliens that are not like we have seen before, there are some aliens that don't resemble any other aliens.  This movie will really satisfy people who want a good alien movie without feeling like they have watched a crappy movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       (No spoilers here!)   In the mid-90s I was at an all-ages show that had an anime with a pretty cute girl. This girl, while she had pretty much the same voice as I do, had an unusual way of speaking.   The girl had a cute way of talking in her native Japanese, which I'm not sure if it's a bad thing or a good thing. I loved her way of saying things. In the beginning, she would talk in a really cute, squeaky, high-pitched manner, so cute that I felt like I was sitting next to a pet. I couldn't help but get attached to her. At one point, she's talking to an adult-looking man, and she starts talking as if they were both her friends and I could understand what she was saying because she sounded so cute. In between those lines, however, she started getting a little angrier. She was saying some pretty nasty things about the other adult- looking man, saying that he's a pathetic loser. I think I remember this conversation: "I don't believe in this country anymore. I want to go to Japan!" "I see where you're coming from. We don't need that kind of garbage in this place!" "Yeah, yeah, I'll go with you someday!" And with that, the girl said she would go back to Japan if she were allowed to go back.  The guy was saying that maybe she could go back as a tourist. "Tohsaka will just go and find a job, then she'll come back with a suitcase!"   I would have thought she would have been pretty much forced into joining the military for a little while after that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a big fan of the film "Dune", and I was amazed with the amazing work of John McTiernan, and the beautiful film "The Abyss". However, I did not like the sequel "The Secret of The Inca". I thought it was quite lame and uninspired, and was expecting a bit more from John McTernan.   A very strange sequel to the film.  If you enjoy John Mc tiernan's film "Borgia" then this one is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't realize that this movie was going to be good until I started watching it.   The cast does a great job portraying these characters, and they seem to play off of each other quite well.  It is very interesting and sometimes funny.  If you have a couple of hours to kill or a few dollars to spend, then this is a good time to watch!    What I liked:  ...the writing is funny and a little weird but that was the point!   I'm glad the film was a hit! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story was great! The main character, Charlie is such a great guy who gets a lot of crap from people because he is the one with the big cock and loves to fuck in the movies and his dick is long! His dick looks awesome and when he is fucking a chick he does a great job making the chicks pussy wet. He is also a good kisser and a really good guy. He also has a nice attitude and is a true leader when he needs to be. He gets the girls to do a bunch of things for him to get his money and gets them drunk and fucked up. It is a very funny movie and has a very fun ending. I watched the original two and liked them well and think this is a good sequel. There are only one or two funny scenes and the sex scenes were okay. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw a review saying it was a "good" movie, and I think that is a big understatement, but also a very well made movie. I like movies where the good guys win, but there was a lot of tension in the movie, especially in the first half when the story was about to be finished. I didn't really see the movie's point until midway through, but it made a good showing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was going to watch "The Devil's Advocate" for the third time because I like all of Christopher Nolan's movies, but I found myself watching it more for its music than for its acting. A lot of people say that it's Christopher Nolan at his finest and I totally agree. He manages to create a movie about the trial and execution of a murderer that could have been from the beginning of a Hitchcock movie. He makes the music really well and I can still remember how it got on my nerves as a kid when he did "Inception" and it only got worse the more I heard it. It was really hard to listen to the song "Sleeping in the City" when I watched it and it's the most boring song I've ever heard. I'm not sure why this movie got made when it was so stupid and yet so good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was never a big fan of the movie, but I always liked the actors. The movie is very well done. The cast is talented and really gives it the best performance. I always like a nice romance film and this one is just that. The film was written by a woman named Barbara Wiedenkehr and the film was made by a man named Herbert Ross.   Liz Lemon, Jeff Bridges, and John Goodman in an interesting set of situations

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first part of this is a slow burn of an action thriller. The characters are so well-drawn that you are immediately invested in their struggles. This part of the film is very tense and well-paced, which is what I really liked about it. Then comes the second part of "Black Sheep", which is a really well-done piece of comedy. There is a very simple premise, which makes this a very short film: a blind man with a cane meets a deaf man who lives in a house in the woods. They start off very friendly and it is only after a little while that things start to get really good: the deaf man asks the blind man to teach him to read, and when they start to read and talk about everything, they have a bit of a funny moment. This scene, where the deaf boy asks the deaf son to tell him about his dreams, reminds me of " The Last Movie ", another movie I really enjoyed a lot. The third part is more of a psychological thriller, where we get to know more about the character and about the man's past. The ending scene is a little too long, but for this kind of movie, it is perfect.   As far as I am concerned, this is one of the most original movies ever made. It is not a typical action thriller but a psychological drama that focuses on how we perceive the world around us.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As mentioned earlier, this was a fairly small movie (for the genre). It had a certain style, and a small cast, but I found it interesting. I liked a lot of things about it, including the movie-within-a-movie concept (and the great actors who performed it), the style of the special effects, the humor, the music, and even the way that some of the actors were written for, and were cast well. I wouldn't change anything about this movie for the world, but it wouldn't be a bad way to pass the time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was quite entertaining, it was an interesting story. It is interesting because it has two stories going on at the same time. The movie also has some really good special effects, very good I will say. The character designs and acting were pretty good.   It took me quite a while to figure out what happened in the beginning of the movie, but at the end I think it was pretty clear.  Posted by K-K-Kitty at 1:56 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is one that needs to be told and needs to see to be believed. I was really surprised at the fact that the story didn't seem to be completely taken out of the movie from the moment we first meet the girls. As they grow closer and closer the more the story gets told and the story takes shape. One thing that I really liked is how you can feel the characters, which are all well done and seem real. There is not a lot of gore or sex, so I didn't really mind this aspect of the film. The girls were really likeable and real. As one of the older girls it can be a little hard to understand her, but once you get to know her she is a nice enough girl to be in a film like this, which is great because we get to see the girls grow and grow.   I didn´t really have any problem with the acting, but I do have a few quibbles. The older lady was kinda annoying and I think she was a little too old, and the older one is a little bit annoying as well. The acting was great and I really loved seeing all the characters and getting to know them and learn about their past. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a little different from all the other'saga' I've seen. It's a very good story with a few twists along the way.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for the supernatural. I like how it was written and the movie has a good pace. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love "Saving Private Ryan". It is about an entire platoon of men who are on a mission to stop a German tank from breaking into the US in World War II. The story of the war in Europe is awesome. I have to say that when I was watching this film I was shocked at the amount of German tanks that they had to fight against in order to save their country. It was really awesome. When you think about the amount it took to save all the soldiers from German tanks and when you think that all the German soldiers were from the same family and had a common desire to stop their country from falling into the hands of the Germans then it was really a cool idea.   The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was that the characters didn't seem to have a lot of chemistry with each other.  I wish that they would have had the chemistry that they did in "The Hurt Locker" but I was really glad that I got to see this movie because it is a really cool movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was completely taken aback when I first heard about this movie, not that I am one to see the world, but that's a pretty huge deal. I was also surprised that I didn't feel so bad about seeing it. This film is quite enjoyable. Although I didn?t like the movie much, I am not sure how the filmmakers were able to make this kind of a movie that didn?I think it may have been by putting a lot of themselves into the movie?s story.    The story is about a young girl that loves to draw. She gets involved with a local artist that has a drawing machine. It works a lot better than she thinks. She spends a lot more time drawing than she?s allowed to. The artist has a daughter that he?s also involved with and the girl has no idea that she?d eventually be drawing with her mom.  This movie is good at keeping its audience interested. The art, which I feel is very good, is really fun to watch. The girls? and the story make for a pretty good evening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Battleship Potemkin" is a superbly crafted piece of propaganda. The main character of the film is the Grand Duke, Sergei Potemkov, a man who, through his political career, has risen to the position of a power-hungry tyrant. In this film, he orchestrates a Russian-Kremlin backed revolution in order to gain greater control over Russia. It is a masterfully choreographed production: a grand ballet of violence and political deception set to a stirring score. The film is, indeed, a film about power. And Potemko's ambitions are enormous. The result is a masterpiece. The story is simple: Sergei Potemykov has seized control of the Russian Government after the assassination of his father, and is now in a position to change Russia, a country he despises and would like to rule himself. He has a small crew and the power to do what he pleases, and he uses the crew to commit various crimes, which he later tries to cover up. In the end, he does manage to destroy the opposition - the resistance, as the people call it. This is all very well-crafted; it is well-acted and, with the exception of one scene, well-directed. I had never thought that such a complex film could be made, and yet it is. As it unfolds, the film becomes more and more interesting. There are many characters, and a great deal of plot, and the film unfolds like a novel, but in a manner that is never predictable. The movie is so rich in detail and symbolism, and I found myself quite immersed in it. I found it quite interesting. And this is an excellent film to watch in the theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this, I was expecting something like the "Man On The Moon" movie, which was also excellent. The movie is about a young guy who was at a party and he suddenly gets a new car, but it's really a machine for him. He is trying to make a living but he doesn't succeed. As his friends go to parties, he gets more and more depressed. This movie is very good in that respect. It's funny, very dramatic and a good example of how to make the whole thing work. It is a good comedy. The dialogue and dialogues between the friends are very funny and it shows how much they care about each other.   The story is not really that complex, but then again we can't expect more.  The way the movie ends is very funny. It gives us a nice look into a young man's life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would like to say that I am a huge fan of the movies and TV shows that they have on TV. I like the way the movies are made. I would never go see a movie like this if it wasn't a television show. So far this has been a really good show. It seems to keep going when it is time to end. It makes a great time for a movie on a hot summer day. The movies are really cool. They are funny and it has a good plot. I'm glad the show is being put on TV again. I always liked it when there were shows that lasted for a long time. I have watched a lot of old episodes of the series. If you are a fan of old shows like this I would recommend watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of people seem to like this one because of the premise. It's set in the future in a world where robots have the same intelligence as humans and are a threat to both. The story is told through a series of short stories that have no relation to each other, and the characters are fairly well drawn. The actors are good enough, but a bit too bland to make a good impression. As a whole this story seems to focus more on how interesting and entertaining it is to watch a robot make fun of people than it does on the main plot, which is a good thing.   What does it do well:  It's about a robot that takes advantage of the fact that it's human, and it's funny, and is generally entertaining.

The movie is the story of a man who gets lost in the wilderness and finds an odd creature.

It is all a lie and the man is actually a demon trying to escape his sins and take over the world.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a bit disappointed when I got my first DVD copy of this movie and saw that it was about the murder of the woman's dog that we are following in the movie (the police officer). After watching the movie the cops got to work investigating the crime and solving the crime. The guy who is the lead on the murder, he has a good character (not so good acting though). The movie was so enjoyable.   The only negative about this movie is that there is a little bit of a long break between the beginning of the movie to the end, but you get your payoff before you realize that.  This is a fun movie to watch with some pretty good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it. It was funny. I laughed out loud when the old woman gave a speech to a group of kids that was telling them about the time they went on a mission. I was really annoyed by the people who are trying to convert the children. I would have liked a little more time in this movie before they all started to talk to the children and preach to them about how bad they were because they didn't believe what the missionaries said. There were some pretty good lines in this, like, "God has an absolute disdain for the young." And, "These young people will go to hell before they ever believe that God is a cruel and unjust dictator."    Positive reviews are the most valuable!   There are some real gems in this film. I especially liked the part where they go to a movie theater where there is a big screen showing the real life movie of an old man. The old man is sitting there watching the movie and talking about all the things he has done to people over the years. After a couple of minutes of talking about how he has killed a lot of people, the film stops. The young kids have come to watch the movie. In their minds, it is like a real life version of "The Wizard of Oz." After watching a short montage of all the good things that the old man has done over the last 30 years, the kids go off to find their parents.

I recommend it to all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie in the series, about a young boy named Johnny and a girl named Ruby. The movies were made by a Japanese production company called The Ghibli Company (Ghibli meaning flower), and they were released in 1989.   Like I said, the movies are very beautiful. And the animation is also very good.  In the first movie, Johnny and Ruby are in a tree house. Ruby is an extremely pretty girl, and she has a big, bright, sparkling smile that will make you want to spend time with her. Johnny, on the other hand, is a pretty boy, and he is rather shy. It's not too much that he doesn't speak much. It is more that he speaks softly.  And in the second movie, he's stuck in a house with no friends, with only Ruby and his father, who is a nice man. They can't talk. They talk a little bit, and then it's time for bed.  What's really nice is that each of the movies has a nice story arc. Sometimes Johnny and his friend, Eddie, are in the woods, and sometimes Johnny is in a big city. In each movie, there is a new scene in which Johnny and Eddie are having fun.  The music is fantastic. The music in the movie is by Hayao Miyazaki. I was so thrilled to listen to his music that I didn't even know I was listening to the same composer, except the one on Spirited Away.  One of the best things about this series is the music, and the music in this movie is great. It brings you back to your childhood, or to when you were a little girl.  I can't say much about the stories because I don't want to spoil anything. The stories are about as good as you can hope for. If you haven't seen Spirited away, or have never watched a movie by Hayakawa, I don to recommend this movie to you. You can watch the first two movies on the DVD, and I don' t think it's worth watching the last two movies if you haven' t seen the first one, either. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit I was a little skeptical when I went to see this movie but I was pleased with it. I liked the characters more than I did the characters in the movie. The movie starts out fairly slow, but there is a lot of interesting stuff to look forward to.   The movie is set in a small town in Texas that has a lot in common with Southwestern towns. There is a big highway through the middle of town that runs through all the buildings and most of the houses. The highway goes through the center of town so most of people who go out of town are on the highway. The town doesn't have a big police force like a lot more of the small towns in Texas and the town sheriff has a nice enough face and personality, but not a lot going on there.  In the town, people know each other from the road or they can get away with being strangers. They don't really know anybody. The main character (Drew), his sister(Hollie), and a few friends go to a town that is about to be relocated to some other town. The other town they were going to is the same kind of place they went to when they were kids, a sort of ghost town. There are a couple of pretty good old-school characters in there like a local police chief and some other old-fashioned types.  Some of the old-time folks in town are really nice and some of the others are old-timer types that don't have much left to live for. When the town is moved they all get together for a little BBQ and it is fun. The sheriff does his best to keep a good balance between the old school folks and the new ones.  The main characters of the movie are nice and likable and the relationships they have with other people is fairly well developed and well-developed characters.  This is not just a bunch of kids hanging out and having fun, but they are also thinking about the future and planning for the future.  I liked this movie. I recommend it for fans of westerns and the kind of movies like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, which was about a group of guys who are having trouble figuring out how to kill a zombie (I assume zombies are just people who became super powerful by consuming the blood of their neighbors and loved ones). This movie had a great cast, with Paul Scheer as the leader and David Milch as his lieutenant. They were great actors, but also very funny.   A few things to mention. I liked the ending, but not in the way that I expected.  The movie is about a bunch of guys trying to figure out a way to kill and eat a zombie.  I thought they had a lot of fun.  This is a comedy.  I also liked that there was a sequel to the movie, called Zombie Survival Guide.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching the movie   at the movies last night (the one with Chris Pine in it) and thought it was quite good (and I've seen some movies that I think are just great, but this one has some great performances by Pine and Michelle Williams, and a lot of really funny, wacky scenes).   The thing that made this movie really cool and fun was that   it was an ensemble movie  and there was a lot going on, but it was always good and entertaining.   They were mostly played by different actors, including a couple of non-actors that were very good, so the movie was never boring or stupid (for some reason a lot people can't do that).  A lot of the people were funny, and some of the scenes were pretty funny. I was never bored or bored out of my mind watching this movie, and I'm sure many of you guys will enjoy it.

I thought the movie was fantastic, with great scenes. The thing I liked the most was the opening of the movie. It really set the tone for the rest of the film. The acting was excellent and the story line was fascinating. I do think they got some things wrong in the movie and it was a bit too long. I will say that I'm a huge fan of the first novel, and I think you should read it before seeing the movie, it makes a good comparison and it explains a lot about Katnism.

This movie is about a very bad guy who tries to get out of a bad situation by breaking a few rules to get his revenge. It has a lot of gore, and a few nudity, although it is not shown on screen.   My daughter and I watched it at the same time and both enjoyed it. I don't know if it would have been more appealing to me if the female leads were not so ugly, but I can't really complain. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last few years, with the rise of social media, have seen a proliferation of movies about the 'Mean Girls' (or 'Peepers', in the case of Girls), who were always portrayed as being socially inept and having no self-esteem. So, if you were thinking about watching a film about the class of 2000, you might want to rethink it. Girls has the girls from all walks of life and they come from all parts of the country, not only London. What I loved was that the girls didn't make a scene, they were really funny and kept a sense of humor about themselves.   Although the film wasn't too long, I think this is one of the best examples of a social satire about the current generation of women.  The story is very simple: A group of girls from different schools attend an all girls school. Their lives are changed when they learn that they all get a room at the same time and are to sleep on the couch in one room.  It all starts with a girl who is forced to share a room with her best friend, but it isn't long before their friendship is ruined and they end up being separated in the end.  A lot of things go wrong in the life of the girls, but I think it's important to remember that no matter how bad things start, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel for them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the story of a high school senior named Mimi, who has always wanted to be a cheerleader and she finally does it. One of her teammates, a skinny, dark haired girl named Juri, is just as interested in being in cheerleading as Mimi is, so she is the cheerleader's first "frenemy" of the season. They are joined by the beautiful, smart but slightly perverted Ayaka.    The plot is pretty simple, but it manages to tell a complex and funny story in a few short hours. It was hard to really believe that this was just a little girl with a dream who was eventually turned into a "hunk" by a teacher and her friends. I didn't laugh or cry at all, but I felt like I was missing out on an amazing story.  It's definitely worth a watch and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes cheerleading or is interested in the school life of a "small town girl".   -Meh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching a bunch of movies from "Dangerous Minds" (the second installment to the "Dangers" franchise) that have the tagline "When a group of super-geniuses put their extraordinary minds together to solve the world's most challenging problems" - and then finding out that all the geniuses are actually just a bunch ol' losers and a bunch o' fools.   I'm not gonna lie, this is a great movie, one of my favorites.  I've never been a big sci-fi movie guy, I've enjoyed a few, I like "Aliens", I like, for example, "The Terminator", I liked "The Matrix", and so on.  But this was just... so much better than those.  And that's saying a lot, because I do have a tendency to love the "Pumpkinhead" stuff, which is why this one's in my Top 10 (and I have a very solid case for that), and the "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" (which is a good one) is probably in the Top 5.  So I was a little disappointed by the first one, but I've been able to be pleasantly surprised.  The movie's a bit too long, I think it was a few hours too long.  As for the characters, they're pretty much perfect.  This is the first movie I've seen that really has the "right" amount of characters and characters that actually seem to feel like they have real reasons for their actions.  Of course, all the "dangerous mind" members are in it.  They're all pretty much just a group that has a few common ideas and just happens to be smart enough to pull off such a crazy job.  While the movie is set in the future, it is very much in the present day.  In fact, there's one scene where the entire group is running out of the building in a blizzard, and it's very reminiscent of the first scene of "The Six Million Dollar Man" (I think they used the exact same sequence).  However, unlike in "The six million dollar man", where they were all playing out a "danger game" to get enough money to get a "superweapon", in this movie they're all just playing a simple "puzzle game".  I like that they didn't make this as an action movie.  Now I'm no action
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite scene was a scene of David with his girlfriend playing hide and seek and it was hilarious   And I think the best thing in the whole movie was when David was at a bar playing pool and he saw a drunk couple and was jealous but he wasn't allowed to get too close.   So then he decided to find out what the drunk guy was up to and find out about what happened to his ex-girlfriend and he ended up having sex with the drunk man and he loved it and then he had to go home and get dressed   but that was just a small part of the movie but still awesome  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw this, and I'm excited.   "You know, it's so rare to see someone at that age being such a natural actress and a great actor," she said.  I love the way that she was able to show so many different emotions without having to change her facial expressions, just to fit into the role.  It's rare to get to see a character in a child-star movie who can just be herself and it's always so refreshing and unexpected,   It was really good to see,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not looking forward to this movie at all. I heard from friends about it and they said it is like a cult movie.   This movie is like "The Matrix" in that it is just very entertaining.  It is so different in that there are not many talking heads and it is basically all about the action scenes.  The characters are very likeable. They have some real personality.  I am a fan of martial arts movies so this movie was a real treat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love horror.   It's a movie about a guy that lives in a house that is haunted by a guy who has been dead for years, and he is obsessed with that man.  He keeps looking at the man for no apparent reason, and once he notices he runs away from the house.  The only person who can get close to the man is a woman who lives in the house and she wants to find out how this man died, so she can make him whole.  I liked the movie.  And the sound was good.  It reminded me a lot of the classic "Saw" movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie, it's a great little movie about a boy and his dog. It's about a family and their dog and how the family deals with the boy's autism. I really liked it, it didn't have a ton of action, it wasn't something to rush through but it still had a lot of heart.   The action scenes were a little boring at times but then again I liked them and there are some really cool action scenes that happen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of bad movie and bad action, but never anything this bad or as bad as "Wolverine". It is a sad movie from start to finish. This is probably the worst film in the history of cinematic violence. No one was killed in this movie, no one was seriously hurt. Even if it was an action movie, there's no character development whatsoever. This movie is a "paint by numbers" flick, with a "Punch a clown" theme song. They had a storyboard artist draw pictures that had the Joker in clown makeup talking about killing people in a movie theater.   This is so bad that it really is better to not watch this movie at all. It will make you want to vomit in your mouth. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good film that should be on every list of the best films of all time. I would say a better movie than the first (of which I'm more of an admirer) and I've read a few good reviews of the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was an interesting movie I liked it. It was an hour long movie but it was fun. The people were likeable and the plot was interesting.   I also found it interesting that there was no romance in the film and I found it hard to watch the love story between a woman and her boyfriend ( the guy was a jerk ) but it worked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Tucker: Fully Loaded" is a really fun, quick, funny movie. It's good to see a movie where all the jokes are all original (and not like they are trying too hard to be funny). You get to see some classic characters like John Goodman, Vince Vaughn, James Caan, and Peter Dinklage. Even better, a guy that we didn't expect: Sean Astin. I don't remember much from this movie, and maybe I'm remembering it wrong, but at the end, you have some great scenes: the one with the guy in the bathtub and Sean Astins hair and the one where he has to say his famous line "I'm from Texas." It's funny, quick and full of action.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie had its good points, its bad points, and its funny at the same time, which made it one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. It made me laugh for the entire duration of the movie and the way it was shot was just brilliant! The story itself was really good and had great dialogue and really cool effects, and it even had some good singing in it. Overall, this movie is very enjoyable and i think most people who have seen this movie will like it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a big fan of John Carpenter. I know a lot of you guys probably haven't seen a lot but I would like to give a quick review for you.   There are no monsters here so it is all about the suspense and the suspenseful dialogue. The story is told from the POV of a man who has to fight his way out of a cave.  He finds himself alone in a room with a door. He doesn't have a way out.  The guy has to get out of this room and he doesn't know what he's going to do.  It was very atmospheric.  I really like this guy.  This is a classic of a movie and i loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that if I could, I would have gone through with the idea of buying this movie so I could have a full sized replica of my room.   It's like my room is in a real haunted house!   (This room is actually a little creepy!  I wish it was a movie in a haunted house, but it is a movie about a haunted room.)   The movie is like a ghost story told by someone who doesn't understand ghosts! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was an excellent little film, a short film about a man who works on a railroad that runs along the edge of the Pacific. He is called "The Railway Ghost" because he sometimes feels as if the railroad is coming closer to him than the train. He feels his eyes are growing big, his arms and legs are growing, and he is starting to look like a human being. And the reason he feels like that is because of the way he is feeling inside his body.   The railway isn't moving, but the people are coming, and they are coming in the way they always have, in a great hurry.  They don't really know how fast the train is moving or where it is going, but they are going as fast as they can, or at least that's what they tell us. And they never tell anyone about what they really are, or about their reasons for being there. It is like they are doing their job, but there is no way to tell them how their job is done.  When they arrive at the other side, they don't want to tell anyone, so they keep their secret. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is not very good and a waste of time. You will not get the sense that it has something to tell. The story is a bit boring and there is no romance. The movie starts off like a typical action movie. The bad guy is always trying to kill the good guys and the good guy always tries to save his friend. There is no real plot to follow and the ending is a little unsatisfying. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie, it was about a small town that has a little "dynamic" between a little girl and a big bad.   The girl gets jealous and goes after the big bad and the bad one kills the girl.  The main bad guy was a big man who lived in a cabin and it was really creepy to see how he was "in bed" looking at his little girl.      His little girl who was the "fawn" was an actress (in the film) and she was very nice to the bad guy.  A few times you would think that the big man and the little girl was going to kiss and he would have her.  But the bad boy would be gone and it would be back to a normal little town. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story, the story, I loved it! I wish I could give it higher ratings.   I love movies about characters like those from this movie!   The movie is a love story between two friends, Alex and Jack, who had always been friends in real life. Alex is a young woman of eighteen, who has been with Jack for a number of years. Jack has been in the military for fifteen years. He is a real veteran. His life is pretty much a lie - he was on active duty for twenty-two years, and was stationed in two different countries. He has a wife, and has children.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the TV show, "Parks and Recreation." I was really bummed when "Pawnee" wasn't renewed this year (but I suppose the cancellation meant more episodes for us) but "P&R" is an even better show, with a much more adult feel, and lots of jokes.   And even better, you'll laugh and get a good laugh from all the "pissing and mopping" that is to come...and from what I saw, it's an even BETTER movie than "Porkchop Express!"   The film takes a very short break after "Punch-Drunk Love" in order to follow a bunch of kids from high school to college and other life experiences.  I don't mind that the film doesn't go for more "puppy dog" laughs, or go for too much "Punk in their own way" action.  You'll enjoy it because it's very funny and very well done.  There are some great moments to come that I'll definitely be watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film has been making it's way around the Internet for a couple years and is one of my favorite films. I do not know a lot about its plot but I do know the character of John Hays, and what he is trying to do in his life is to bring his daughter back to him. He starts off by taking his daughter on a trip to Washington DC, a small town in a big state. His daughter gets lost in the woods and John finds her several times in the house in the middle of the night. He eventually finds her walking around in a state of shock. As they get back to John's house, his daughter and her friend, Beth, decide to quit their jobs and start a business, in order to provide for their children's needs.   It's about family and love, but also about the power of God, his faith, his relationship with his daughter, and his determination to bring her back. It is such a moving film, not for the sentimental reasons, but to get into the character and the story.  A positive review: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie! The cast does a fantastic job of bringing all the characters together. My only gripe with the movie is that I wish we saw more of the relationship between David and his mother (as he's just starting to be a father). It would've been interesting to see what would've happened if he hadn't gone off to college.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The characters and their situations are interesting, and the plot works well. The performances are good, but I didn't really care for the actress playing the girlfriend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot. It has a great set up. The pacing was good, the movie kept my interest right from the start. As far as the plot goes it did not seem to be as complex as other movies I have seen. I did not really know where the story was going until the last 5 minutes. I would have liked a little more dialogue between the characters, a bit more plot explanation, and a little better acting on the part of many of the main characters. This movie has a lot of action, a lot going on all at once. It is very difficult to watch a movie like this. There is a lot happening, the story gets confusing at times. It seemed to be a movie about a group of misfits who are trying to make their way in the world. The acting was good but I felt the movie was missing a lot about where it was going.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I watched this movie for our anniversary in April 2012. I gave this a chance because it was rated a "4", but after watching, I was not impressed. I think the writing was terrible. In particular, the ending. The bad guy is shown to be a very nice person, a "genius" who does research on how to get around a roadblock that he creates. He gives a presentation of this on a television and his wife watches him at work. She is appalled. He is a very handsome man, a lawyer, and a nice person. I do like him and respect his work. I found the ending very lame and I was so confused by it that I couldn't understand how they could end on such a lame note. He shows a videotape of a scientist who is about to have a heart attack, and then gets hit by a car. He gets a few cuts in his head and then is told to go to a doctor. He returns later that night and finds his wife dead on the floor. He goes to the doctor who tells him she died from a heartattack. Then the doctor shows him a videotaped of an interview with the bad guy and the scientist. The doctor is on the phone and his colleague, a man in a suit, enters and asks what happened. The man looks out the window to show a person in a car hitting a pedestrian on a crosswalk. The camera pans up and shows the car to be an ice cream van. When it pulls up, a few feet from the pedestrian, it stops. The pedestrian is hit and falls to the ground. The van driver looks shocked and apologizes to his colleague and leaves. We see the bad guys office door open. He sees his wife and turns around to find his wife lying dead on a couch. He then says, "I'm going to get paid. That's why I'm doing this research. I have a reputation to uphold, and I can't let it go to waste".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most important movie to come out this year.   It is about a small town girl in Texas who is bullied, but she fights back and wins.  It takes place in the early 80's.  The film is a well-acted film about a bully.  I recommend it.

I don't mind that much at all, just like the movie doesn't have a happy ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie from a B&M store in the late 90s. There was a film I was interested in and I decided to watch it. The movie is about a young man who takes care of a girl that is a bit of a loner. This boy goes to visit the girl at the hospital. The girl has no idea what to do or where to go. She has been sick for a while. The boy tries to convince her to visit him. He explains he has nothing more to do for her and he will take her to see a man who will help her. He does, in fact, convince her that she can do it better with him. The rest is history... It was the first time I saw a film about a guy and a girl on the road. It was a short film but it was good. The voice acting was okay. The music was fine. The characters were just a little too plain. They were a little boy and a younger girl. The older boy was a bit old and the younger girl was a little odd.

"It's a very strange, odd, little film with a few unique touches to it: a little boy sitting in a chair at the dinner table; a little man trying to kill his father.

It is definitely a great, weird, little movie, and a great way to spend a couple of hours at the cinema.

Coslin "The first half of the film has the feel of an old-time film noir with lots of slapstick and jollity." - Richard C. Hoagland "There's lots of comedy, slapstick, and plenty of adventures, which all seem to be set in a fictional New York where the city looks exactly like New York." - Mike Karpf "It's a nice change of pace from the more traditional crime and espionage movies that usually dominate the genre." - Roger Kuster

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good time. I think a little on the ridiculous side (for this era) but then so are the best movies, so I can't complain much.   The story was pretty well told, well told I thought, so it made for a pretty interesting and entertaining ride, I'm not so sure about the acting though. There's a great performance from Richard Todd in the opening, but it was somewhat lacking in the middle of the movie (which is pretty well acted in its own right) and I do like the voice cast, except for a couple of characters, I liked the one who I didn't remember in the last movie (and I think it was her daughter) but the other two were a little much for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not see The Hunger Games, the adaptation of the Suzanne Collins book, until the first movie came out. It was one of those movies that felt like a video game, and I was not a big fan of the characters. I watched the first two films in 3 days in a row, and then did not watch the third film until the next day.   The book is about an imaginary world created by a mad man called Cincinnatus. In the fictional world, a group of kids, led by Katniss Everdeen, fight their way to the top. Each member of this group is given a set of skills and talents that they use to get to the center. The plot is predictable, and it is really difficult to follow, but it is also interesting and fun. Katn iss' goal is to find Peeta, and save him from a horrible death. Each time she and her group of friends are saved, they learn a little more about this world. In a way, the story reminds me a little of The Hunger Dogs and/or the movie of the same name, although it is definitely different in terms of the setting and characters.  The movie is a lot better than the book. Katniiss is just an awesome character who will make you feel the emotion of despair. It is so depressing to watch a kid that can kill people with her bare hands, and we never know what will happen next.  However, it is not really good. It has been done better, and the pacing is a bit off. The movie starts out with an absolutely hilarious scene of a little girl falling off a wall, and having to grab her hair, and her mother yelling at her to get up. This scene has really got to me, and is kind of funny, and to me it is the perfect start of this movie.  I also think that the kids should be able to walk and climb like they are a toddler. It would take far less time, and be more believable.  It is not good, and not good at all, it just seems like a poor adaptation of a novel.  After the opening scene, a very bad guy, named Peeta Mellark, shows up to kill Katnison, but he is stopped by a woman named Rue, and later by Kat's mom, Mrs. Everdeen.  This does not make sense to me. This woman who was not seen before or after the first three movies is
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, a nice touch:  This is a good little movie that takes a bit of time to get going, but it doesn't take its time so much as it just gets on with the job.  The basic plot is that a young woman is taken hostage by a gang of thugs, and while she is being held, her boyfriend has been kidnapped by one of the thugs, while her best friend is in a barber's chair waiting for her to come home.  There are a couple of scenes that might have been a little clunky in my opinion, but all in all it was a good start for the movie.  I also had a fun little story about a little boy with a huge cock, which I found a lot more funny than a lot of other movies of this type (which is kind of ironic in a way).  The movie didn't really have that much in the way of gore, but the violence was used well, and there were some pretty graphic scenes that were shown.   I liked this movie a lot.  As mentioned, the first half of the movie is a bit slow, but I think that I liked it a lot better than the first two, which were pretty much just a bunch of men beating the crap out of each other.  Overall, a good comedy, but not as funny as I think I would have liked it to be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie 3 times now and I have to say that I still think that it has a lot to offer.   And there is a story in this movie and the music is pretty good.  As a teenager I used to like this movie a lot.  I always thought that the movie was pretty dark in its themes and the film is very graphic and well done.  The acting is very good in this one.  There is a lot of violence in this, but there is no gore and you can't see any blood.  A lot of sex in this and that may be a problem for some people.  One of the scenes is extremely graphic and it is hard to see if the people are actually dead or if they are just lying there dead.  Another scene with a guy eating another guy's face.  Not too good, but it's not too bad either.  This movie is pretty hard to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well... this movie is good! It was fun and good, although some things were a bit confusing but it was all done well and I liked the characters a lot, besides the guy (with a name that's never explained) is a bit annoying, but I loved his attitude and he had a lot of nice lines.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really really really like this movie! It is really good. It is a good film, it is not too long and not too short. It makes a good story and I can understand that a person from the United States thinks that the other way around. It reminds me a lot of "Star Trek". A bit dated for my tastes though, but this is still a good action/adventure movie and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is an absolutely delightful piece of art. The score and lighting and sound design are brilliant.   The only drawback is that it takes an hour and a half to get to the actual film, but that's a minor issue.     I am not sure what the plot is about. It seems to have a lot of sex, but I have no idea what the point is of it.  The cast is great.  John Travolta is really funny and good looking.  I love the fact that when he comes in he puts his hand to his crotch and the camera zooms in on his underwear and then shows them.  When he gets out of the shower there is a lot more going on than there was on his first scene.  It makes me wonder if it was a big part of the whole show or not. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know about this one. I would love to see a western that isn't set on a prairie. This one seemed to me like an interracial romantic comedy about a black man, a white woman and a young Indian woman who decide to go to the west to meet a guy who has recently come back from a long trip. Then, they try to set a date and find out that the woman is married. Now, the white guy is a "bald head" type who doesn't really look like he has much going for him. I do like the Indian woman. She's so young looking and pretty, too.   The acting was good though, the film is well done.   Review was the best of the year: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " The story is very well written and tells the story in a way you never would imagine,"     said Mike.   In this movie you see a typical day in the life of a young boy and his mom, who is his "mama" in her old age.  The story seems to have been inspired by a certain Disney Channel show called "Journey to the End of the Earth", but we never got to see the show.  In the movie, the young boy, Max, has to protect his family, which he believes is under the care of a woman who will kill him if he doesn't do what she says.  Max doesn't understand why he has to do this and keeps asking his parents "Why me?"  He gets a strange phone call and tells his mom that he needs to find his dad, but she doesn't believe him and believes that she is dead.  When she wakes up, she asks the phone to call someone "important" who will come and tell her what to do and it goes to a dead man.  Then the phone calls back and it's her father.  At first, his father wants his son to stay in the attic and go to sleep, but his mother tells him that he has no place in the world to go and that he can get lost in the woods forever.  It's a great movie and definitely worth watching.

In 'Frozen' it was the Queen and the Snow Queen who were the lead characters.  There's some humor and good action.  It was a bit long, but I think it's pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting film about a family in a small town.   Not the usual family affair I think.  This film takes a rather bizarre premise and twists it into a fun film.  Some funny gags, some creepy characters and some great acting.  The performances are good too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fun little movie, but it's pretty sad. It's all about a dog and his father who live in a remote area of Alaska. The dog keeps the wolves from their prey. The wolf's father died, so they are not on good terms with each other. The dogs go to visit his father's grave to get his old wolf outfit and take it with them. A bear gets his revenge on the dogs by putting his mouth on the grave. The bear gets away with it and kills the dog. The boys meet a local hunter, and the local hunter teaches them to hunt bears. The hunters keep the wolves at bay. The boy who lost his wolf outfit is now a dog.    …
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think you should know that there were several movies in this set about World War II (most notable is the German version which is not a bad film). I watched them all and I'm sorry I have no more to say. This is a great movie. It's hard to describe the movie. I think it has a sort of slow start but it's a very nice movie that has a nice message. The music is great. The movies take place in a very big war. The soldiers are a group of guys that don't fight but live. This movie tells what life was like in those times. All the characters seem so real and so real the war is very real. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first saw this movie as a kid, and I remember laughing so hard that I almost cried. The movie is about two friends that were best friends in a very strange world. They go to a party at a very odd hotel in the middle of the night. The girls don't like them very much at first but eventually they fall for them and become friends. I can still see the faces of these two girls whenever I think about it.   When I was in junior high, I saw this film over and over and I wanted to be in their lives. It was about friends who loved each other and liked to drink, smoke and fool around. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. The story is well done, the music is very good, and it is an interesting plot.   It is a shame that the movie only has three acts, but then I have a hard time believing that they could have kept this movie going with four.  It's just too bad that the third act has a lot of repetitions and you don't get the feeling that any of the characters are going to escape their situation and go back to a normal life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the funniest movies I ever saw in a theater, or at least at home.   This movie was well written and acted.  The actors really had fun with it, and the humor was very clever.  It was a must see in theaters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I was given a gift of a great movie.   It is an old movie about a guy who is living in a small town who meets a girl who is really pretty.  This movie is very funny and the comedy is really great.  The romance is really cute as well.  There is a lot of sex scenes but it is not too graphic.  It isn't a very long movie but it was a lot better than I expected.  I really loved this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie that I enjoy is   The Avengers   and if I had to pick   Iron Man   out of   five   films,   I'd go with   the   best   one   in   my collection  .   Thor   played a cool villainous role as he could use his mind control powers on Tony Stark.   There are several scenes I could reenact if I could get the time.  He had a long and difficult road to get his powers back up to full power after he took a wrong turn. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie, well written and directed by a very nice, well done, and well produced movie about a group of friends at a local amusement park.         What I really like about this movie is that it deals with friendship and the nature of it.  These friends are all young and they have a lot to learn about each other. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't think it was a bad movie.  The writing is a little slow for my taste.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first watched this film in the early 70's, when I was a teenager. It had a really great script written by a guy named William Atherton.   This was a great film that had a great cast of actors.  At one point in the movie, a woman (Linda Gray) was trying to kill her boyfriend.  It was quite a dark comedy film at the time.  The film itself was quite disturbing at times.  This film had a lot of disturbing scenes.  One scene was when the two characters were at home, and there was a little boy playing outside.  Linda Gray was trying a lot to kill him but he didn't do it.  Finally she tried to use a gas to kill the boy and he survived.  In the final scene, the man from the house was trying very hard to get the boy away from Linda Gray.  Then the woman came in, took a knife out and stabbed him, so the boy was still alive.  That scene made me laugh out loud.  I enjoyed watching this film.  A very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is one of those films that is a big hit worldwide.   In a short story called "Jenny and the Pussycat", a young lady called Jenny is having a love affair with her boyfriend Pete. They get married and Pete is really unhappy with the wife and her children. Jenny has a little crush on a beautiful boy called Kevin, Pete's uncle. When Pete comes back to London, Pete tries to convince Jenny to meet him for a little drink, but Jenny is worried about Kevin. Pete goes to the boys house, and Kevin, now dressed in his uncle's clothes, gets an enormous fright when the mother arrives and asks him to take the girls home. She takes Kevin to a secluded area, which Kevin has never seen before. Jenny and Kevin are playing together, when Pete suddenly appears and tells Kevin to go home. When he does, Jenny and the girl disappear and Kevin is left alone with Pete's mother. When Jenny gets back to the flat she tries to call Kevin, but his mum gets in the way. Jenny is furious, and is about to beat up the mother and her family, when Kevin appears. The next day Jenny is in the front room, where Kevin's uncle is waiting to give him a letter, but the letter does not arrive. Jenny goes downstairs, but Kevin is not there. Pete is not home, either, and the aunt and uncle leave to get him. When they come back, Pete is very sorry for not having delivered the letter. But he knows that Jenny is waiting for him, and he is very angry at Pete, who has never come back to find her. When the aunt asks if she has seen Kevin, Jenny says that he is with her. The aunt and Pete are amazed, and Jenny and her mother go home and Pete tries all day to persuade Jenny to go with him again. Jenny stays with Pete, because Pete wants to keep her happy, but she is very unhappy. One night Pete goes out in the rain, to get a photograph of Jenny. He returns and finds Jenny with Kevin, and Pete gets angry and leaves. She goes to bed, but soon hears a noise in the hall. Kevin is trying to help his uncle escape, but he has forgotten his scarf. Kevin finds it and makes a very funny face. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great sci-fi film about an alien race that has landed on Earth to create a world where humanity can live together as one race.   It is a simple yet fascinating story about the people and their society who are so much closer to a race of creatures than we are.  This is a fantastic film that will stay with you for a long time, as its an excellent sci-fied film with lots of action, action, and lots of humor.  I would highly recommend this to anybody who loves sci-ed and funny films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only negative I can think of about the film is that the title is a little misleading because it is actually an action movie about a man who is a police officer with a special force that investigates murders. When he's not hunting criminals, he is protecting innocent people from criminals.   It is a well-paced action film with plenty of tension.  It has the best and most original villain in all of horror in this movie. It is an excellent, well-written film that is easily recommended to a horror fan or a person who enjoys good cinema. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was about the last day of the school year, but everyone was so excited about being home.   I've never seen a movie more like a book, especially since it was about a school boy who is a big fan of a TV show that he is a fan of.  This is a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film in this new series from director Joe Wright is a fun romp.     The premise is that a boy and his dog are abducted by aliens.  The girl is left behind.  Wright is an accomplished storyteller, and he manages to take a simple premise and turn it into something fun.  There is a reason this is an excellent movie.  When I first saw the movie, I thought it was the same as "Rango" in terms of style and plot.  In short, they have the boy kidnapped and taken to a different planet, where he is told the world revolves around a girl.  As a result, he's given the choice to marry the girl and save the planet from destruction.  Although the ending is predictable, the story itself is great.  I didn't see a good amount of dialogue, but it felt natural.  While the action scenes are impressive, the movie is a really fun ride.  It also features a good soundtrack and some awesome special effects.  A good movie for fans of action movies or for people who like to watch good movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of the 1980's "Duck" movies you won't be disappointed with this one.   This movie stars George Clooney in a hilarious role.  It's also an excellent action movie with some funny moments and a little gore.  I didn't get the humor in this movie at first, but after the first 15 minutes I began to laugh a lot and was just enjoying the action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved it. The movie had a great cast of characters that the audience can identify with. It was a great story with a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always been a huge fan of the original. I loved all of the new cast members, and liked all of their chemistry with each other, it really felt like a great ensemble cast. I was also very excited to see a sequel, it's always been on my must watch list for a while, and I'm happy to say it's here. This film feels like a sequel to the first, but I've never really been a big fan of how the original did it, I guess my issues with the first are that they felt too much like a glorified TV movie, and not nearly as interesting as I liked them.   The characters are all really well done, and although I wish they were more fleshed out, they're all good fun to watch. I think if they would've done a little more with the character interactions in the first film, they could've been better, but it's all well done.  This is definitely one that should be rewatched in the future, because all of this is very much relevant to today, and is quite amusing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to think I'm the only one who hasn't seen a good, non-cartoony film of "The Addams Family". I did read the "The Movie Facts" book about the films which appeared on television, and I was surprised to find that a lot of people have seen it (I don't think this was an uncommon film). I enjoyed it a great deal, and would recommend it to anybody who has seen it. I liked the animation and the special effects quite a bit, but not all of the humor was very bright. The characters were all likeable, but I thought that some of them were a little too "cute". This is probably the movie that will last the longest in my "to watch" list. I think it's a bit short on humor, and a little short on plot. I do recommend it for those who like kids' movies, or if you're looking for something to keep you company during your summer vacation.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely in love with this film. I had a hard time getting through the first two minutes. I am not really a horror movie fan. This movie was more of a psychological thriller than a pure horror movie. There were two scenes that were so creepy that I couldn't stop laughing. After that I really wanted to go back and see if there was a sequel. I have never seen a more disturbing movie than this one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you loved The Exorcist and The Omen, this movie is for you. The movie is good.   It gives a good description about the real events.  It does a great job at capturing the essence of a cult and its evil.  I liked how the film took place in a fictional world of the movie. The actors did a good job.  A couple of things I liked were when the cult's leader is trying to prove his worth. I thought the idea of the cult leader was very well done. He was creepy in a creepy way.  Also, the movie does a good Job at showing the evil that surrounds us.  The first movie was not the best. I have to give it a 5.0 but if you want to see the real thing go to the movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I have seen most of the big budget monster movies and they are all garbage. So why should a new horror film be any different?" - Christopher Whelan, July 2009   It took me some time to decide whether to watch "The Wolfman" or "Wolfen" but the former was a very interesting movie. This was not a good idea to try to make a big budget horror film but a really great one that gave a good scare and was entertaining enough to keep me entertained. If you enjoy an entertaining horror film then I highly recommend the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the first great movies I have seen and I still like it to this day, I have never seen a film like this, not even by George Lucas. It is a classic sci-fi/western and it was a classic Western in the 70's. The soundtrack and acting in this movie are simply stunning, this movie is a cinematic masterpiece.   I liked it a lot, it was one of the very first films I saw. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good horror film, that is.   For the first time I've found a film that has an interesting story.  Yes, it has a very dark and disturbing feel to it, but I do not think it's dark and icky.  The idea is interesting and I am sure there are plenty of people who will be looking for this film in the future.  For a little while, I was thinking I would love to see a sequel to this film.  I thought it was well worth it, especially as the director had some fun with the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was going to go into this one with a negative review, but the cast really brings out the best in the movie. They have a good chemistry together, and there's not a moment when any character is a bit too much or too little.   The acting is excellent for a movie this short (4 minutes), and all of them have a different tone from each other, and with a few exceptions are good enough for this movie to be worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of this movie and it has definitely put my childhood back in a time I will remember for a long time.   The action is great with the villains doing their best to make the most out of their time. It is a time of nostalgia that has been given to us by the old classic and I love how we are given a lot of information and time to really get to know the villains and the good characters.  They did a great job of not making it look like a mindless action film.  The soundtrack is great and you will be able to sit down and enjoy it for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know who's a real badass?   - Michael Douglas The other day I was in a movie theater in NYC watching the great Tom Hanks movie "Cast Away". The opening shot was of a beautiful woman who was floating through space (I think). She made a brief appearance as a woman who'd lost her husband on a boat, and then, after she made a deal with a shark, she started swimming back to him. As a result, a little bit of time was lost, and the man she loved drifted in a sea of water.   In this movie, he was floating somewhere in the ocean.  So this is the story. A couple of days ago the lady made a pact with a giant shark.  It is very likely that she will get through the film without her husband. The sharks were after some seals that she had been working with on the ocean and the seals have a habit of coming back in one piece.  In the end, the lady gave up the shark and said to the shark "You don't care about me; I'll never have another meal in my life".  The shark, being an idiot, decided to eat the woman, which it did.  I have to say, this movie is pretty good. It has lots of good performances and really a good story.  As for the cast, I thought it was great. The star of this film was Tom Hiddleston (as it was named), and he really does bring his A-game here. Hiddlington is a great actor and really knows how to make you believe in him. His character really gets into his scenes here. I'm a fan of his work and he was really excellent in this film.  The other actors did well.  -  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   For me it was the story.   It had a very interesting premise.  The whole movie is about a man named Richard, and his battle with his best friend, who seems to be a very evil and sadistic kind of person.  It took me a while to get into it because Richard did not seem to be too likeable at first.  In the beginning he was in a terrible situation and he had nowhere to turn and it was so sad but the movie just kept going and going and it had me on the edge of my seat.  I loved it because it kept me guessing and guessing.  All of the characters were interesting and all of them got their time in the limelight.  What I really loved was that when the film was over there was an end scene.  When Richard and his friend were leaving the mall it was like a real ending.  One of my favorite movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a must-watch movie. The movie is based on the book of the same name written by John Grisham.   In this film, we have the good guys, who are not necessarily the heroes of the story, but you are allowed to root for them.  The bad guys are evil, but they are not completely beyond redemption.  You get to see some very nasty scenes (i don't like the ending of the film) and you get to hear the good guy (John Grishams) rant about how his ex-girlfriend is still there and that he doesn't want her back, and that when he gets a little older he'll never get her back.  He also says that "there's something funny about the bad guys.  " It isn't a bad movie. It's a fun movie.  It is really funny.  I didn't think I could enjoy a good Grishan film so much, but I did.  This was a good time for Grishans to show that he isn't just a good writer, but also a good story teller.  And we saw it all!  I'm really surprised the movie didn't get a lot of attention.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about an abandoned place called "Zoom". It was once a big castle and is now abandoned and overgrown. But what it lacks in looks it makes up for with an amazing soundtrack. You can feel the ghosts of the residents of "Zoomp" as they walk through the old streets. A few of them even have a little chat with the villagers while a young boy plays in a tree on top of a tree. The movie ends in a pretty good way. The cast is excellent and the story is really well done. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am usually against watching a bad movie on television because I find them boring, but this movie did not disappoint. It's pretty well acted with very good acting by everybody. You'll probably be able to identify a few actors that don't do their best work (i.e. "Trey" from "Sons of Anarchy"), but other than that the whole cast is amazing. It has a really cool soundtrack. It did have some plot holes, which makes me question the movie's plot. I do think this movie would be more enjoyable if it was based on a true story.   This movie would have been better if it were not about drug dealers. I like that the movie tried to make it real.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw this movie it was one of the few that I had seen before that were actually funny.   The film is about an Englishman named John (played by Jim Carrey) who is a complete douche bag to everyone who knows him and who lives in a house full of cockroaches and rats.  His only friend, John (also played by Carrey), is just like him except that he is really good looking and has a good job.  However John is always looking for a way to cheat in a game and John always loses the game because it is too complicated.  When John is asked to play the same game again, he tries to cheat and fails but then realizes that if he keeps trying, he is going to get all of the money.  So John goes to a friend and asks him to borrow a set of dice.  The friend is very impressed and agrees to lend him a set but John keeps asking to borrow more until finally the friend gives John a dice set that has six sides that are all one number.  John tries to use the dice but he can only roll six sides and if he rolls any other number the game goes back to the original rules.  After a while John realizes that he has nothing else to lose and he throws the dice and his friends money at one another until John gets his money and the game is over.  It is an incredibly well acted film and one that I recommend to anyone who wants to see a film with no plot, a guy who is always trying to cheat or lose and a set that is always the same.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's all I want to do," says John Travolta, sipping the whiskey in his corner of a Beverly Hills coffee shop. A few months ago, the actor, in the guise of "Vincent Vega", played a role in a TV movie called "The Devil's Own" directed by John Milius. After a memorable performance by Travoldo, he got to work on "Cult of the Dead" a remake of the 1978 film of the same name with a female lead.   With the help of his manager, he was hired by a production company and sent to Los Angeles.  The actors were then given a week in Los Angeles to find a woman to play the part of a girl's best friend. After seeing the pictures on the news, one of the actors, Danny Aiello, got to talking to the production company's agent, Harry Kagan.  According to him, it seemed like "something out of a porno." The producer, Mike Grazinski, then asked Kagan about it. The agent said he knew something was a little different about the picture. After the first day of shooting, Travone decided to play Vincent's "man-hater" role.  During this time, they got to know one another. After several scenes in different places, Tamer was asked to be the one to come to the apartment of a young woman. At the same time, the agent suggested to the young woman, who wanted to be a performer, that she might like to do the scene with Travon. The young woman was called Janie. The two actors had dinner together. This was a first for both. "I have never known any other actor to want to have sex with me," says Janie, who is now a married woman.     After the movie, Tommie and Janie went to the home of Harry Kasten and his wife. The couple invited Janie for a drink. She knew him as "Harry."   When the drinking was over, they returned to the hotel. Harry was on the phone to a casting director and asked for a young girl, "Janie," to act. The actor said he didn't think it would be such a problem.  "They're only doing it at home," Kagan told Kast, his partner on the picture, "but it's all done in the hotel." Harry then suggested
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie in a theater with my son who loves action movies. The plot is pretty bad with a bad director. The movie was very over the top and unrealistic. We have a young man, named Alex who works as a car salesman. Alex is in love with a girl named Stephanie. He meets Stephanie's parents at a family function and goes with them to the house to see them. While there Alex tries to get a job at their house but Stephanie's mother wants him to be a stay at home dad so he can work at home. He says he is in the middle of a divorce but Stephanie doesn't believe that and she and Alex get married. Alex's boss thinks the marriage is a terrible idea and tells him that Stephanie has told Alex about what she has done in the past. The marriage goes through the roof and a kid is born named Joey who is not happy. Alex and Stephanie are at an after party with his boss. They are talking about what they have been through and they can't even stand to be there together. Stephanie breaks the news to him that she is pregnant and he agrees to keep the baby. The two move in together and it goes pretty well except for Stephanie getting a little upset about losing Joey. After a while Alex decides to go back home to New Jersey where his parents live. They have two little boys and one day he leaves with his wife and one of the kids to go to New York City where his friends live. Stephanie and her friend Joey meet up with Alex and his wife in a bar where they talk about Joey and his life. Stephanie is a little concerned because she thinks they will end up living together and she wants to see Joey as soon as possible. She finds a hotel room for them to sleep in and she is asleep in the room. As she is sleeping the phone rings and she answers it to find that it is Joey. She asks Alex what she is going to do with her life. He tells her she is not going to be able to have a good life because she has the baby with him. He doesn't want to marry her. Stephanie then tells him she doesn't like him and wants to live in New Jersey and that's it. The next day Alex has to go on a trip to New Hampshire and Stephanie stays with Joey. The trip is going great and Alex makes a very good impression on his friends. He goes to New England and comes home to find his wife dead in the bathroom. He takes

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been watching a bunch of movies this year and I'm always really drawn to the one that's a little different. This is one of those movies.   It stars a former astronaut (Ed Harris) who has a son (Jason Bateman) and a son-in-law (Kevin Spacey) who are working at an orbital base.  When his wife (Mary Kate Olsen) passes away, he and his son (a great Kevin Spacey), decide to quit and go back to earth.  They then get caught in a military training accident and the father, who is an astronaut, is left a quadriplegic.  One of the things that was great about this movie was that I was not sure what the ending was going to be.  It's got a great plot with great characters and good acting.  This was a fun movie to watch, it had a lot of laughs and it was a good, good looking movie.  I liked it a lot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie on a Friday evening and I was ready for a good time and the ending was a good climax to the movie. This movie was very good, it has a lot of good action scenes, but it also has good laughs and a decent story too. It was very entertaining to watch and the plot was very interesting.    I liked the movie: Yes this movie was a lot fun to watch.  Yes it had a lot to it and I liked the character development.  It has a nice story to it.  The action scenes were good.  There was a very nice soundtrack to this movie and it has many scenes.  This movie had a great ending.  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action and comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to agree with the other reviewers here. It's a fantastic film. The story is an excellent one. It is a short film so if you can't handle it then you might not enjoy it. There are two good scenes. The first is one where a man tries to rob a store in a city park. There is a storekeeper and a good friend who are friends. A woman is with the man and she and the storekeeper come to an agreement. The storekeeper lets the man go. When they are alone the man shows her the gun. The good friend comes in and tries to explain to her what has happened but she doesn't understand what has happend. Then the good friend tells the storekeepers and they figure that the man is a killer. There isn't any violence or anything that I think would make it a bad film. It only has a very good story with a great performance by a great actress.   A couple of hours in a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Spirited Away" movie is quite well made but unfortunately it is not one of the best. There are a lot of movies which are really very good and well-made. However, the movie in question "Sorayajit Ray's "The Golden Years" is not that good.   It is one of those "Sarabande" type of movies in which the story and the movie are the same in all 3 versions. In fact, I found it very difficult to watch the movie because of the long and repetitive scenes. The movie is basically about an old woman who comes into contact with an alien (The Golden Child) and he keeps trying to teach her lessons in a different age and world than what she is used to.  The movie is actually rather interesting because the alien is an old one, an old and wise one and he wants to teach his old mistress some new and fresh lessons. But the movie suffers from the same problem as all the "Sari-bande" movies - there are too many repetitions. The whole movie looks and sounds the same and you just get used to it. I must admit that I had a great time watching the movie but it doesn't really deserve the number one position on my "Sori-bende" list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite film is a sci-fi/action movie with a good storyline and amazing special effects (that are almost always bad).   This movie takes place in a distant galaxy where humans and other races have co-existed for ages and humans have made a huge jump in technology. But humanity can not live in harmony with its neighbors and, eventually, this leads to the first space battle in the history of the universe (the one in this movie is a bit different from other sci-fis).  I really like the characters.   The main character is a Human who loves technology. He also wants to save the earth, especially the poor who he is in love with, but he has to stop the war because of the human's "cuteness" and his "love for the universe".   It is very funny and a good science fiction movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a sequel to 'The Dark Half' (2003), it's a remake of the horror film 'Blackout' (1977) from the 70's.   It's a good little movie, it's got that 80's, bad-ass-shooting-movie feel to it.  It has some real creepy-ness to it that can only be appreciated when it is re-watched.  The movie does have some decent performances and the editing isn't terrible but it's not a great movie either.  A great flick with a decent sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about "The Mummy," I thought it would be a great movie. Not only because of the great actors who had been cast in this movie, but because of a story that was going to be a lot of fun.   I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I was thinking that it would have some good ideas, and a good ending. It didn't disappoint.  I am not going to pretend to know everything about the movie, because I really don't know all that much about the history of Egypt, or Egyptian mythology, but I have read all the information that I could find online about this movie.  This movie was a bit of a remake of a popular movie that was made about the year 2000. The Mummy is a pretty bad movie, it is not a bad movie at all. It is a bad film with good acting, and good story. The story is a remake, but the new movie is an improvement in a lot ways.  There is a lot more going on in this film, and it is a much better story, it even has a little bit more to it.  It is also much more entertaining to watch this movie than the previous film.  If you like the old movies of the Egyptian gods and goddesses, like "The Amulet," "The Tomb," or "The Scorpion and the Frog," you will enjoy this film. It has its good points, and its bad points.  Also, it features a very good song that is a parody of "The Music Man."   A good movie, and I would recommend this to anyone who likes good movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am in a really good mood right now.   The movie is pretty good and the first half is really good and funny.  I love the humor that they put into it.  It is very very good for those who like good old comedy.  This movie is a must watch.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen all of this series and I'm glad to find it here on YouTube. The show is about a small town and a family (the Schutz family) that is struggling to keep a small farm going and make enough money to keep the family running. Their life is not easy as there are all the usual problems of farming: debt, disease, starvation, and a few other things too. In the midst of the troubles the Schutz Family is faced with another problem. They are going to have a child and so they move to another town and start a new life. The first episode is a fairly standard one, but I was surprised by how good it was. The music is fantastic, the acting is very good and I had a few laughs. It was a nice change from some other animated movies I have seen. It's worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie on TV. I did not know what I was getting into when I chose this movie because the whole time I thought this movie would be about a guy who finds out he is a vampire and how that would affect him, but it is really about a group of high school students that are trapped in a small college and it is pretty much a classic, if you know what you are getting into it. I also loved the concept of being trapped in such a small place and finding out you are not. There were some really great scenes that made me laugh and I had to admit to my mom that this is the movie she had been talking about all these years when I was a kid. It was a little confusing at first when you realize that this college was in Iowa. But when you saw it in 3D and realized you were actually in a college theater and the music was really good, it was worth it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very pleasantly surprised by this one. I'm not going to spoil it by saying anything, just say, I enjoyed the movie and was very satisfied with it. It's fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a decent movie. While it is a generic science fiction movie it does have some good moments.   The film does get a little predictable at times.  The first scene with the robot is an interesting one. The robot in the movie does have a kind of creepy look. In the second scene with a girl being attacked by a robot it has a good pace.  With a girl and a guy it gets a little silly and you can see the female leads not really being themselves.  I like the android they have in the film but there are other android in other films out there that have more appeal.  While there are no memorable or original moments there are a few decent scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie about once before (although I never gave it a good review), but I was so impressed by it that I thought it deserved a second viewing.   There is nothing special about it.  The story has a fairly standard story structure with a guy on a long voyage across the Pacific (he must have been traveling the whole way from Japan?) and, well, nothing interesting to say about the plot.  There are some beautiful shots, especially from the cockpit of the airplane, but the rest of the movie is not very good.  In fact, I can't help but feel that this movie has a bad aftertaste.  So what is so bad about this movie?  Well, the story is basically that there is an airplane crash and an older couple is rescued by a Japanese couple.  Their daughter is a little girl.  They take her to a remote island where they live and give her a good education.  When the Japanese couple is kidnapped by the enemy, it becomes a rescue mission and the parents go off to find the enemy.  Then, just when they're all set to be reunited, the little girl is taken away to live with an old Japanese man who is married to an American woman.  This movie is about a Japanese woman (who is supposed to be a little baby) who is a virgin.  And that is it. It's pretty standard stuff, but it has all the ingredients for a good film.  I really liked this movie, it was very much like a "real" adventure movie - not a sci-fi film, just a good old fashioned adventure movie with a good plot. So, how does this movie hold up?  There were a few times that I got the impression that I was watching an old film, but I could not be more mistaken.  At the beginning I thought the movie would be dull, but there is a lot of fun to be had with this movie.  It's about a little Japanese girl and the old Japanese woman and their adventures across the world.  Not the best film ever, but pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen the movie, but read a review where I'm sure it was good!   It was like watching a movie version of the old tv show, "The Three Stooges".   There was a lot of action, and the characters all had a fun time! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very enjoyable. It is not as long as I thought it would be but it is a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed every scene. I love the music. It has a wonderful sound. The movie did not have the great ending as the film did not last much longer then it's time.   The characters are great. It will keep you from crying because your heart is going to hurt. I have a feeling that the next movie will have a lot more of a mystery with more action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was a great movie and worth a watch, but it was a bit long.    I was really worried about it.    It is a beautiful movie and is a great addition to the list of French movies I love.  So, now, that we got this out of the way... I found the French language rather easy to learn, even though I am not an expert.  But it is interesting to me to be able to converse with French people, and this movie is a good example of that!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had heard of a couple of movies I wanted to see but was too scared to go because of all the hype and bad reviews. I went to see "Tales From The Crypt" and I must say it is much better than all the bad ones. There is just enough scares in it and it never gets boring. The performances by everyone in the film are great, but I think the best performance is by John Saxon. I was scared of him from the first time I saw him, but he didn't let me down. He is a really good actor and he really gets to show some of his acting talents.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You would be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable film than the fantastic adaptation of George Orwell's novel "1984".   In the last years of World War II, Winston Smith's brainwashed "thought police" have become a popular way of solving crimes. The brainwashing starts by training all members of the force to act in a manner that is more conformist, and more robotic, than a natural person would act.   When an officer is caught doing something that a real man would do, they beat him up. This leads to a rebellion.  "Oceania" is Orwell's take on a world where the government, like the Roman Empire, takes away individual freedom, and forces obedience by terrorizing everyone with the potential of a nuclear holocaust.  The film follows the rebel Winston Smith as he and a small group of his fellow rebels try to survive in the midst of this totalitarian nightmare. They take advantage of the fact that they are "not" human to steal food and water, which is stolen by Winston's fellow rebels from a local community.     This film will probably be remembered for one thing and one thing only...the famous line "the past is a foreign country, not known to us, and probably never will be known to future generations" that is repeated over and over again.  This scene also represents one of the most iconic scenes in film history.  One of the best parts of the film is the music and editing. There are not many movies that feature music as good as this, especially at the time when there were no film scores to speak of.  It is one of those rare films that has a great soundtrack.  Another wonderful scene is the one in which Winston and his friends are in a prison cell and trying to decide whether to escape or wait for the police to show up. They decide to go down into a sewer. They come across the corpse of a man who had recently died and are unable to decide who to murder.  An absolutely perfect scene.     The special effects are amazing and make the movie feel like a science fiction horror movie.  If you can find a copy of this film, you will be happy you did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good, but not perfect movie about a little girl's life and a good teacher and a little boy who are all on their own adventures, which are somewhat related in a way and that is an interesting idea.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched it with my daughter. She was really into it and asked me to let her play the piano, which I thought was awesome. She's a little older and didn't like some of the jokes, but she had a blast.   There was a guy at the end who said that it was really sad how people die after losing the love of their life.  It's a very emotional movie for sure, not a very funny one, but not depressing either. It's not a story of a man and a girl going on a date, but that's not my thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of movies, a lot. Some have stood the test of time better than others. When a movie does this it's a very special and unique experience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, my brother and I are big fans of science fiction and horror movies. One day a friend from work brought a DVD copy of "Alien" with her. I wasn't much into the movie, but my brother thought it was great. Well we have been seeing it every Halloween for the last 5 years. I love the special effects that give a good sense of depth and realism. When my friends come to visit I show them a few close ups of the space walker.   This movie doesn't leave you with much of a bang, but I like to think that the alien is a good friend to the humans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason why this film is so good is the acting! There is really a lot of good actors in this movie like: Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, and others. I have seen several movies on television with these actors, and I think these actors really bring the movie to life and the plot is also very interesting. The only thing is that I wish that there was more of the plot because when there is a good plot like this one, then I really enjoy it. So I have to give this movie an A+++++
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the rare times I was amazed by what the Hollywood movie industry can pull off. I was surprised by how much the director had gone to get every aspect right and how faithful and authentic the film felt. This movie is the real deal and should be seen by everyone interested in the film industry and historical fiction in general. This is the ultimate cinematic experience, a true work of history and a real treat for the eyes. It is one of the true gems of the 20th century.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is actually fairly well-executed, especially for a comedy (although the fact that it's called "Shrek" and is supposed to be about a talking shrek doesn't really help). I do have to give it props for the animation, though it's not particularly great. It's pretty decent, but it just doesn't match the quality of the comedy in the movie. There are a few jokes in the beginning that could easily be cut without compromising the whole movie, but they are kind of forgotten by the time it's over.   One of the most original and bizarre movies I've seen this year. It certainly is not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the "Shaggy" and "Prince Charming" films, you won't be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it a lot. The acting is excellent. The pace is perfect. The writing is crisp. It is a lot of fun to watch. The plot is quite complicated and hard to follow at first. Then it gets quite easy to follow. The ending is quite nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     What a beautiful film. It's hard to believe I am about to write a review about "The Devil's Candy". This film is a masterpiece! It's so hard to put into words what a breathtaking film this is. The story is simple, the characters are very human, but I found them to be so lovable and likable. It was wonderful watching them grow and change and become more like themselves. There is one scene near the end, I was really scared. The ending is a beautiful one. It is a sad tale but the ending left me with such a great taste in my mouth. The voice acting is also wonderful and the cinematography is fantastic.   "The devil's candy" is an incredible movie that is not to be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies ever, and the best of all time (if you know how to judge a movie with a high standard). So, I thought I would start with a review on the movie itself.   The premise is an excellent one: a girl who is dying wants to die by murder. She finds a dead body, and an accomplice, and goes after them.  It has everything to be one of the greatest movies ever made, including great performances by all the actors. The plot was well written, but it was very slow paced. A lot of people thought the ending was predictable, but I thought it was a nice twist. There were a few times I was not sure if I was going to be excited about this movie, and a lot of times I got confused about who I was with, who my friends were.  But the thing I liked about this is that it never was pretentious at all, and all of it made me laugh out loud, so I give it a 10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think we all know what the movie is about - a guy named Jack who's a little older than most other characters, and has some kind of weird problem. After trying to live a normal life in a nice little suburb - he just can't do it. His parents divorce, and then his parents remarry, and he's got a daughter. She's kind of an attention seeker, and can't get any respect from her boyfriend. He tries to be nice to her. She can't take it, and she starts to hurt him. I can only imagine what her reaction would be if she found out that his little old dad had been dead for 20 years!   Jack starts taking LSD - which leads to some interesting experiences - but ends up in a real mess. He can't go out with the girl anymore, because he's just never able to find a way to let his little girl be herself. And he can't deal with her being more interested in boys - so he starts to cut off the contacts with her mother. It's not long before they break up. It sounds like some fucked up thing from a sci-fi novel, but there's a lot of it to work with.   The movie isn't overly flashy, but it is good. It doesn't try to be a big Hollywood movie - and it certainly doesn't give a shit about being a "family picture". It's a film about family, but the message is really, really important. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is based on a book by Jules Verne, "The Mysterious Island". It is one of those rare, very enjoyable, and enjoyable things you would see in the theatre once a week. It has a very unique atmosphere.   It is a classic sci-fi movie from an earlier age.  And I mean the "sixties" which means it had all the features that we like today from such a time.  It was a very big success as it was made in the USA.  When a film was made by a director who was a child star in the 60's it has to be good.  The movie is a great adventure that has a good story.  But the best part is not the story, it is the special effects.  We have many different, realistic looking space ships, and the crew is an interesting bunch.  All the action scenes are exciting and exciting.  I especially liked the opening credits.  Even a kid can appreciate the movie, but not everyone who has seen it would like it.  You will have to have a great imagination to get the most out of it. You are expected to get a huge smile on your face everytime you watch it, so it's not a bad thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a very good cast. It's like watching a Broadway musical. There are lots of funny characters including a very nice, very good looking, very talented actress (Sara Gilbert) playing the lead. A very good performance.

A really boring plot with a small cast of characters.  It feels like they all are going to get killed at some point.  No idea who they're going to kill!  But they all seem so happy to see each other.  The movie doesn't really work on the audience.  And I like that.  I hate that.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last ten minutes of this movie were the worst. I was hoping to love it, but it didn't make much sense.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first "good movie" is the film The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1973). This is the classic bad guys movie that is not bad at all.   As a kid my father took me to this movie a few times, I remember it with great fondness.  The film has great actors like Robert Mitchum (The Manchurian Candidate) and Christopher Lee. The film tells the tale of a guy named Johnny Carcosa who is being hunted by a masked man named John Dillinger (Christopher Lee).   Although the plot is predictable, I found this film really enjoyable.  In a way this is a movie about revenge.  To me this film is the greatest revenge movie ever made.  This is a really good film that is worth watching at least once a month.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie! This was a fun film that had a good plot, great characters, and a good script. I really love the idea of the kids and how they interact with each other. This movie had great comedy and great fun!   I really enjoyed how the story followed the same format that was done in the movie "Tales of Hoffman".   The kids go to the park where they see the "Little Miss Snuggly" who is an over-protective snuggly.   It is revealed that Snuggie is actually the big sister of her dog and a "lover-bird". The little boys get a scare when the little girl is bitten by a bird and then bitten again by a snake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Tropes vs. Women" is a fascinating, insightful examination of the intersection of female and heterosexual sexuality in the world of horror films.   It does this in a very subtle, very interesting way, as the film focuses primarily on a group of women, who are all suffering from a psychological disorder called the "Choking Curse."   The women are often afflicted with these symptoms while watching horror films, which usually only feature men as the aggressors and monsters, but in the case of "T Tropes vs Women," the women are all experiencing the same thing, so they end up forming a group called the Women's Army, which is a group dedicated to combating the Choking Curse and freeing women from it.  The Women's A.C. is a small group of female friends who come together in hopes of rescuing women from the dreaded Choking Curses.  The group is led by a woman named Claire, who is the group's de facto leader, and she is the only person in the film who does not have a history of being sexually abused as a child.  When the film begins, Claire is working at a clothing store, in order to pay off the mortgage she has accumulated as an adult.  This is Claire's first day at work, and although she enjoys working with her coworkers, she is not impressed with their clothing, nor is she a fan of the man (David Carradine) who runs the store, Mr. Jones (Tom Hulce).  Claire is concerned about a client of hers who has been given a Choking curse by a character called "The Joker," who is later seen on a TV show being tortured.  It is soon discovered that the Chattering of the Witches is a serious problem, and the only way to cure it is to have women remove their clothing.  But this is not a one-time incident, as it is later revealed that Claire's older sister was given a curse by the Joker at a party years ago.  Her curse, however, was different: she began to experience strange visions every time she took her clothes off, and soon began to see the Joker in the form of a creepy clown.  Unfortunately, the only people who know about this curse are the women in the group, who realize the importance of getting rid of it, so that they can live in peace with the other women.  One of the women who is obsessed with this curse, and is obsessed
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A small cast of characters all with their own motives and goals and all struggling to get by with a few good friends.    This is a fun romp from start to finish with a good laugh after a few episodes.  I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy film with a solid story with strong characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself was awesome. And while I like the idea of the movie (and I mean REALLY awesome) I did find the movie kind of boring. The whole thing was very predictable and I didn't really care what happened. I really liked the premise of this movie but I just did not see the movie's potential.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie reminded me of an older John Hughes movie, but the story was a little more straightforward with a bit more mystery to it. The characters are pretty typical, which is to be expected with all the time travel stuff.   The one downside of the movie is it feels like it went through a lot of editing as the film keeps getting reedited into a bad story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie you must see:  After watching this movie I cried for a long time    It was a wonderful movie   "The Lion King" is a movie that is funny and sad at the same time. It is a story about a child who is a very poor boy who finds a magical lion named Simba and decides to protect the lion from his evil uncle Mufasa. The lion doesn't want to eat the boy so the boy tries to teach the lion not to eat by making a bunch of food and putting them in the fridge. It doesn't work and Simba eats the food. It turns out that this is because Simba thinks he is hungry so he tries to get the food from Simba's food bucket. When the boy is about to give the food to Simba, the door flies open and Simbas uncle Mumbo (as a lion) tries to eat Simba. Simba tries to run away but is chased by Mumbo and Mumbo ends up getting killed. After the lion eats Simba it realizes that it is hungry and finds the boy who tries to comfort it. The boy also tries to reassure the lion and finally they both find a nice place to sit in the sun and relax.   The lion tries to find a place to sleep but Mumbo keeps knocking it down so Simba has to sleep in a tree.  The boy tells Mumbo that he was very hungry and he asked him to cook some food and he didn't answer but the boy was trying to cook it by putting Simba in a container to eat it. Mumbo comes and eats it because he doesn't eat like a lion. Mufas nephew thinks that Simba is starving and is also hungry and starts eating all of Simba but the lion stops him but Mufaos uncle wants to eat him too. Mubals uncle grabs the food and throws it at Simba to get it back but he catches it and throws him back. Mumomals uncle gets angry and the lions tail starts to bend which is a sign of anger. The whole movie is very cute and funny but then we are shocked when Mufaas uncle gets killed by a fire breathing demon named Scar and the rest of Simbas family dies too. This is the best movie of the Lion King franchise. The characters are all in their proper place and the special effects are amazing. It really shows what a talented cast can do when they are given a good
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love it when a movie puts an epic story into film form.   This movie is epic because it goes to epic places, from epic stories to epic battles to epic stories of war and conquest.  It also goes to very unique locations with some great performances.  I can't wait to see more of it in future installments.  This is a classic that needs to be seen again and again.  - April 6, 2012Great movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This one's for the boys," the girls say, and that's exactly what they are. This is a boy movie with a girl in it. In this film, the boy becomes a man, but the girls are the man's helpers, and the best of the best.   The film follows an older man who is a member of the Boy Scout Troop. They meet a girl who wants to join the troop. They give her a tour, and, boy, she does not disappoint.  The movie has no dialogue, but it's pretty funny.  The movie was about a boy scout troop whose members are a bunch of older boys.  One of the boys, named Jim, who is the troop leader, is a very good leader. He can handle a lot of situations. He's a good sport about it. It's the other boys who get in the way. It is said that all the boys have big dreams for themselves, but each one has a specific wish they want to fulfill.  These wish include being a rock star, a professional wrestler, an astronaut, and a writer. But the big wish for each boy is to become a man.  There are a lot more details about each character, but you need to watch the movie before reading.  You need to look for a good deal of nudity. But you also get to see what a man looks like.  A good film for the ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie. I thought it was a nice update of the film "Jazz". It wasn't a great jazz film, but it was ok. The soundtrack was good. The film was good with some good acting. The movie didn't have much romance but at least they had some. This movie isn't too different from a lot of the jazz films you can find. I can see why this movie is so popular. I've seen it several times. I like it a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good story. It is hard to imagine the old school moviegoers being so turned off by an all female cast and crew. And the music in particular, "I want you to remember me", does not belong in a movie about a love triangle, a mother/daughter relationship, or a mother who wants to know what her children know. It should have been a musical, but they all seem so different, it is hard for me to imagine these people together.   I know that the film is not a classic, and I appreciate how far they have come in these 80's films, but the script, the performances, the makeup and the sets, the wardrobe and the music are all just plain not up to date. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have no problems with this movie. It's not great in every way, but it's also not bad. The story is fairly simple, but also interesting. The only thing I couldn't get behind was the final ending. Maybe I would've liked to see it from another angle. It was a shame, because I found a good part of this movie to be very endearing. It could've been even better, but this was a very strong start.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of other people I have seen this film in the cinema a couple of times and I have to say that this is a pretty good film. The script by William Goldman is a wonderful combination of comedy, drama and drama and it has a great ending. It is a story about a man and his two children who live a rather boring life in a small New England town. They have a dog who has a very unhealthy attitude towards people. The wife is having a very hard time of her own and the son has a tendency to become a little eccentric and to get into a lot more trouble than he can stand. However all the problems the children are facing pale in comparison to the fact that one night the dog becomes very aggressive and tries to bite the kids and it almost destroys the family. The mother then goes on a little fishing trip with her two friends but when she returns home she finds that all of the doors have been thrown open and her son is missing. The only place where he could be is at a strange lake which is located close to the house and if she is to find him she needs to go on the adventure to find out what really happened to him. It doesn't take a genius to work out that the dog might be after something really horrible and the mother is determined to find it and find it quickly! Unfortunately the dogs are not very friendly and the story takes a turn for the better as the kids realise that the only way they are going to get back home is to follow the dog into the lake. The film is very funny and the actors do a good job playing the parts. They are all good and it is a very well acted film. I would recommend this film to any children or adults and even if you think it is just a bit strange in places it will all have a nice ending.

It seems like every single one of the characters in this movie is gay and every single gay movie is an obvious attempt to make a buck out of a market where there is none.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most of their other films, this was an entertaining family comedy. The script was written with some of the wacky situations that were not at all what they appeared to be on the surface. A lot of humor was involved, with the jokes about how the son's love for his mom turned into jealousy, and vice versa. The scenes where the kids go for a hike were fun, although they were too easy on the eyes, especially the scene where their parents came to visit, while the kids were on the beach and the parents got in the ocean, swimming and singing songs to their friends. Some of the more humorous scenes were the ones in which the kids went to the pool, where their dads were there to make sure they do not get too crazy. This was a funny movie that I could not put down, and will be a family favorite for many years to come.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't been able to find a single bad movie in the last 4-5 years, but this one stands out as an exception. It features a great actor with an excellent performance as the villain (a former army officer who has an alter ego in the form of a robot and is the antagonist), an excellent plot and story line that moves at a good pace, and is a good action flick with a great villain.

It's really good and I liked seeing the detectives solve a mystery.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a nice little story about a little guy and his family. The first half was mostly a comedy, with a little bit of drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely bored for the first 20 minutes to see how this movie would be. Then suddenly it got interesting.     The main character, the main villain, and a couple of other characters were cool, and their schemes were smart.  This was a good action movie that was entertaining and didn't take itself too seriously.  I saw the first movie and thought it was lame.  So this movie was a lot better and took itself way less seriously. A real action movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched "The Dark Knight Rises" this week and thought the movie had a lot going for it, it really did. There were a lot of cool scenes and moments that I really enjoyed. The movie was quite well done.   The special effects were pretty great.  But the thing that I think was the worst part of the movie for me was the Batmobile.  It looks like a bad cartoon car that the makers of the movies took a $400,000 tax break for.  They took this car off to a place that never existed.  And a place I could not find.  The batmobile was not only too slow, but it had a very low speed when compared to the speed of a motorcycle.  Even at speeds that I would consider dangerous, you would expect a real, honest to goodness car to go faster.  I found myself wishing I would've bought a used car to drive the Bat-mobile. I could've saved some money and had a real car.  There are no jokes in the movie, it is serious and not for the squeamish.  If you like Batman movies, then you will like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It had a nice, simple, yet very memorable plot, but the characters were so well played out. I really liked the acting, and the story really took hold of me. The plot is about two couples and the problems that come from their constant fighting. This movie is a good mix of fun and drama.   This movie has a little bit of humor, but really it is a very simple plot with very good acting and a great ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was a really nice film with some excellent performances and a lot of fun. The plot is really simple and you could easily understand it after a few minutes. The story was about two brothers (Tom and Bob) who go to a little country school in the country and they play the school game where each team has a red team and a blue team.   This was one of the very first "school" films I remember.  One of the things that made it so good was the sound quality (in those days). Tom and Bob have a very catchy tune for when they play.  A very enjoyable watch, although I didn't know what was going to happen, but this was one heck of a lot funnier than a lot (though not a lot better than a few) of the comedies that were made during this time.  The story is really good.  If you have kids, and don't want them to go through a lot to get a good education (and I'm sure the kids who did watch this and had kids of their own did), then this is a great movie for them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't anything special either. It was very typical in a way. The characters and setting are quite familiar. The movie seemed to be a sequel to the original The Terminator, which was a very enjoyable movie and not really any different, other than being a little older. The story didn't do much to change the formula though. There is a bit of romance in it, which is not bad, just not enough to make it special. There are no good villain's and no great villain's in this movie either. I liked the villain's though. They were very different. This was a nice change of pace from the earlier sequels, and the characters did change quite a bit in this one. The good part of this movie is the fact that it didn't try to change its formula. This film is just about the characters in an alien environment. That is it. If you enjoy this type of film, you might find this enjoyable.

When I watched the trailer, I couldn't even tell that there was a story at all, I think I watched this movie for the explosions, but after seeing the movie, it becomes clear that it isn't about the explosions but about how much the character's actions are hurtful to one another and how it makes you feel.  I have never seen a movie like this before, maybe because this was the first movie I watched that really affected me in a good way.

I loved the movie from the moment I walked into the theater.  I don't know where the film was filmed, I think it was either a video or a DVD?   It was a beautiful movie and one I would recommend.  This film took a few scenes from the Harry Potter series and added a bit of the Dark Tower books.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a movie like this, you either love it or hate it.   A classic film in it's own right.  The opening credits alone would make you go "WOW!"   When you walk into this movie, you expect to see a normal everyday family doing their ordinary day-to-day routine.  In this case, their routine is to go to church to listen to the sermons, to have some family meal and then to go for a walk.  This routine is disrupted by the arrival of a strange man, an exorcist.  The man is a bit eccentric and you have to be careful not to make a bad impression on him.  However, he seems to know a lot about demons and demons only.  It is only when his daughter, a little girl, is possessed by a demon, that you really start to think what is really going on.  I won't say much about the demons or the exorcism itself.  Instead, I would like to describe the rest of the story.  Well, let me just say that you would not expect much from a movie set in a modern town.  But you would be surprised at the amount of mystery that is going on here and the level of acting by the cast.  And it's a good casting.  Let's start with the best.  Mr. Travolta.  You get a sense of Mr.T's character from the first scene he appears.  He is an average American who is working very hard to support his family.  His wife is very supportive of him.   She has her work, he has his family, they are all happy.  Mrs. T is the sweetest and kindest person I have ever met.  Then, one day the devil shows up with a demonic child and he is all about sex, sex, and sex.  There is something so strange about him and we have to watch this child grow up.  Not too long after, the possessed little girl is able to talk and she is an  amazing  little girl.  She is not a child that can be controlled.  Her parents do not understand.  They are so desperate to make her go away that they throw away their jobs, leave their homes, and move to California.   But even when they get there, the child keeps her distance from them.  Eventually they send their daughter to live with a very sick and very mean
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The whole thing is shot in a kind of uninspired, uninspired way; not even in a realistic way. It's all the same stuff, in a totally uninspired (in a bad way) kind of way. What you have here is a story told in a sort of 'wish you were there' way. You get a bit of a sense of the world, but it's only the first scene, so it's not clear if this is going to be an interesting world, or just some cheap 'drama'." - Mike K.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got my hands on this movie about a cop who's on a quest to catch some bad guys in a city which is filled with bad guys. The cop (played by an actor known for his work on Law and Order) is played by David Carradine with a very nasty, mean attitude and a very foul mouth. This movie takes place during a day of bad cops being around, this one is called "The Night of the Big Shootout" and the cops decide to break up a gang and find a couple of the bad guys, but all is not quite as it seems... The film is a cop movie, a little on the cheap side, I mean it doesn't look like much but it was fun, and when the good cops do the right things they can work a case.   A little overrated, but I've seen worse...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So you wanna see "Eve's Garden?" Check it out.   This movie had a bit of everything.  At times the film was a bit slow, but it got much better and had some great moments.  It starts with a good premise of an alien queen that gets trapped in a tree while her eggs hatch.  But the egg doesn't hatch and the Queen goes down a dangerous, alien-infested path that could kill her.  There is a good, strong performance from David Hyde Pierce, the second most badass character in the movie, as he kills things that look like birds or snakes and also gets beaten up.  He doesn't just get beaten up, he gets beat up pretty good.  The creature effects, which look great, are pretty good as well, with some of the alien designs pretty awesome.  This is a nice and well done movie.    (3/5)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had to look up "Curse of Chucky" on Google and I could not get a full picture of what this film is about.   Chucky's (played by Tim Curry) mother is a character I could relate to.  This film does not tell the full story about Chucky, but I could tell it is a story about a young girl.  I am not a fan of horror movies.  The movie does not have a lot of gore or blood.  It was a story of a girl, who lives in a small town and gets a lot more attention than she deserves.  Her mother died before she was born.  She had a mother who died in a car accident.  When she was only 12 years old, she got a phone call from her mom and her mother's killer was waiting for her.  But her mom's death was not Chucky.  Chicharito is a good guy.  If you are into horror movies, I suggest you look up this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie was at a small film fest. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. I can't imagine a better, more realistic portrayal of what a human's life in a futuristic society would be like. I could easily imagine myself as someone from this future and I found the acting very well done. I'm sure there were times when they made me a bit upset, like when a friend of the protagonist was getting raped and he was not even interested. However, I don't think the fact that he couldn't help it made the rape any less painful.   After watching this movie, I had some really strong feelings for the characters. I found it hard to believe that these people existed and were able to survive and work in the future, because I don,t think anything could have survived in that kind of society. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite movies of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter and I got our tickets the week before and I had been looking forward to this movie for a while, but I did not expect this to be a great movie. We went to see it at a theater on Sunset Blvd in Hollywood. The theater was huge and had a great sound system. We sat behind a row of tables for the movie and the theater was packed and very hot. The movie started out slow but soon got good. The character of the main character was good and the acting by the actors was good. There were a lot of great scenes in the movie that I wish we could all see. We left the theater with a great feeling. - June 4, 2004I am now a man

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think it's a very good movie!   It's not the most beautiful movie of the year but it is one that I like, and I think that's because it's about a love story.   The acting is good.  I don't see that many of them play the "evil" or "good" characters that are presented here but I do see people play the roles they are meant to play.  And this is what makes the movie great.  There's a young woman who is about to be married to a rich man.  She's an art student and she has a bad boyfriend.  But she does things she doesn't want to do so her father can make her a wedding present, which is to spend the night with the "good guy", a wealthy man who's not her real dad.  The movie is interesting, the writing is good, the acting is wonderful and it's told well and so it feels real.  When you look at a movie that is just about a girl and the rich guy she gets so much attention, when you are at the same time thinking about the rich and the beautiful and being so confused why?  When my wife and I watched it, we were both talking about the same thing, this is a good film.  For more information about this film:  www.danieljrobertson.com

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not expecting much from this movie. The trailer didn't exactly inspire much hope, the plot didn't seem like it had much potential, and when it did, it fell down a couple of times. The acting of the lead actors was passable at best, which is what you would expect from a remake of a popular movie with the same name (in this case, the original was about a teenage boy who was turned into a boy who hates the world, and so on). The plot has a number of holes, most noticeably the fact that the boy doesn't just decide to go back in time; instead, he takes over the body of a kid who is about his age in an alternate universe, and then has a time-travelling adventure with him. However, the movie does have some pretty solid ideas. Some of these ideas, such as what would happen to a world where people had no interest in being happy or having families, would be interesting if not for the fact the movie has so many holes in it. That's a little harsh, but it's hard to talk about a movie that does nothing interesting with so many problems. Overall, this movie was a waste of a decent time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this at a family movie night at a local cinema with some friends and our reaction to it was mixed.   It is a very good comedy about a boy who tries to join the Army and his love for the girl.  However, it does have a bit of a cliched message about the "Army of Love" (the soldiers).   There is also a rather annoying girl and she seems to get more and more irritating over the years.  The script is great with a good amount of comedy and characters that all seem to be well developed.  After watching this it did seem to have some very cheesy humor that I didn't like very much.  It really depends how you feel about the cliches and how you look at the characters.  The girl who looks a little like Audrey Hepburn.  She's got a great name too and if you're looking for a girl to make fun of it's not hard to do.  Also, when she tries to help the guy, she puts on a very bad "spoof" voice and acts like she's really a man.  I think this is one of the better "funny" movies around.  For the best part of this movie the movie stars Billy Bob Thornton, John Cleese and John Clegg.  My friend said she didn't mind that the movie features a lot of "cliches" and "macho" jokes and that made it more interesting.  Personally I didn�t think that much of the movie but it was funny at times and really well acted.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen any of those movies (except for some that were on television) that I like. That is why this movie is a great movie that is well made. It is funny but it is a good story and that is what you want from a movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this before.   The story is good but the acting is bad and the characters are weak.  The director wanted to make a big movie out of a little one but the small cast was never able to develop a story that had any hope of being taken seriously.  It is not a bad film.  It is not going to make any movie fans of you feel good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good story about an old man who is walking around the neighborhood and getting into all kinds of trouble.  The movie itself has a very good cast: Robert Duvall is a nice guy and the scene where he is with a little girl was pretty funny.   As with most of his movies,  the pacing was slow but   the ending made it worth watching.  I did find the ending  to be a bit long but it does show the end of a great story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first time seeing this movie was at a movie theatre where I went with my boyfriend for our anniversary.   This movie is a beautiful piece of cinema that I am sure any romantic movie fan would enjoy.  It is a funny, touching and thought-provoking film and it is the type of film I was looking forward to watching in the past when I was in high school.  There are lots of laughs in this movie and a lot of action scenes.  The cast is amazing in this film and everyone in the cast has a character that you will like, and they play those roles beautifully.  Overall a great movie and I recommend it to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I actually quite enjoyed the whole movie. I was quite surprised at what happened in the movie.   The story of the movie is a simple one. I will be honest and say that I was not that interested in this movie. But I did enjoy it quite a lot.  The movie is quite long. It is just a tad over an hour.  There are a couple of good scenes in the film.  It is all in all an enjoyable movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story itself is so unbelievable that I think I can accept that the movie was made to pay for some real estate, but a movie like that does not really make any sense.   It's like the whole thing was made just to sell more apartments, no real plot in the end and nothing to offer.  I will not recommend this movie to anybody.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie about a guy who lives in a small town who is getting ready to have sex with his girlfriend.   He decides he should take his car to work one morning, and while he is getting out, she shows up and starts talking to him about what she wants to do with him.  He is nervous but they have a good talk about their feelings for each other, and she pulls out her cell phone and starts taking pictures.  She even says she wants a threesome with her and her brother and he agrees and tells her about his plans for that evening, and they end up having an amazing time!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It has all the ingredients of a great action movie, and yet it still manages to be one of those rare movies that can be enjoyed on a Saturday afternoon as well as on a Sunday morning. I know that this review is long overdue.   I first saw this movie at a theater on a trip to Chicago. I knew it was something special since I've been a fan of the franchise since the late eighties. I remember seeing the first three films and thinking that they were very good. I was also a huge fan of John Boorman's 'John Carter' (1982) as well. I had a great time watching this movie. The characters are great, the plot is simple yet interesting, and I found myself rooting for John and Carter and feeling sorry for the two mercenaries. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a kid, I saw an old black and white movie. I think it was called "Chickens." It had a woman who didn't like men. They were mean to her. She always ran around the house. This chick came running around the kitchen screaming, "I want to eat your chicken." Then she walked through the house and she had a knife. The man was very frightened. The chick jumped on him, cut the throat, and then he ran and he died. I've always wondered if the guy who played the chick was really her husband.   I thought the movie was a comedy. I mean, I guess it is, but I'm not sure about it. I also thought the chick's husband was really a guy. I thought his face was really big. I was very surprised by how old-looking she was.

A very funny movie with some great characters.  My son really enjoyed the movie with his father. The way the film was filmed gave an extra special feeling to it.  The characters were like the characters from a Saturday matinee movie but with a little extra punch.  I really enjoyed it with a cold beverage.  A great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the original version of this movie I thought it was a little too long, but it was good.   This is a sequel to the movie that made Brad Pitt a star and made him a movie star, so it's only right that it should be a sequel.  The movie makes good use of it's cast.  I thought the story line was pretty good. I like the idea of making people play a game which in a way makes it a game of life.  There is plenty of humor, and I am glad I could laugh at the badness of the world. I enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are very few movies that make you feel like you could be walking around in the world of a character from a novel.   There are very good performances by the lead and all the other actors in the movie.  The movie is not easy to watch, and can be very depressing at times, but it is still a good film and worth watching.  For the first time a movie made me feel like I could be living in the 1930's, and I will definitely see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I do a lot of things wrong. I'm a terrible actor, I'm very bad at remembering the lines, I get nervous when I'm on set and my makeup artist is always saying my name in a monotone and a way that I don't understand.    I didn't understand a line that was given to me and then I couldn't speak it to the end.  But I was glad I was on the set. I had a great time and I think we all did.  This movie was good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that you can find a movie with a plot and characters that is very enjoyable if you like a bit of action.   What it is about is that there is a guy, I won't say that I love him but there he is. He goes through a period of a life of crime and he ends up getting a job on a ship that is going to a port.  He works for the captain but they need someone with more experience to help the crew.  It is not a plot point but I liked it.  I enjoyed it and it made me laugh a lot.  The main problem I had with the movie is that it takes away so much of the characters personality and it does so through a poor use of music.  It doesn't make it bad I was really into it but it really made me feel like the music was not the best it could be.    The acting is fine and the movie just takes itself way too far from it's own character.  Also the characters are so stupid when you think about it, which is a problem if you are a fan of crime genre movies.  That's a good reason to not like this movie.  Recommended not very
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. I'm not sure why, but this movie made me fall in love with the film industry. I always knew that the acting was fantastic but to see it live-action made me go insane! It was just great fun to watch all the actors put in such great performances!   This movie had me glued to the TV throughout the entire run.   I'm looking forward to all the sequels! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a very interesting story about two very different people in their late teens, who meet each other on a train after a party. They both have problems with their lives but also love for each other.   The movie will be a little hard to watch.  It is about a teenage boy (who is a complete idiot) who lives with his mother and stepsister on a deserted island. He is the only person who knows about this island which he has been told about by his mother.  He is also not very bright and is very gullible. I do not know why this guy (who knows so little about the island) would go on this trip in the first place?  I think the most interesting part about the movie is that both characters are very different.  The one with the IQ and the gullibility has a lot of potential in his life, but is not able to use it.  This makes me sad for him as he is so unique, but still I found myself rooting for him in this movie.  I thought he got some good scenes, but there were also parts that made me cringe. I did not feel sorry for him and I think he is going to have some issues in life, so I will always wish he was smarter and would realize what the island is like when he was younger.  There were a few times where the characters were very uncoordinated (in a good way) and in my opinion they needed to be more coordinated (in that bad way).  I also thought it would be interesting to see some different clothes the characters wore, since it is supposed to be a desert island.  One last thing, if you liked this movie, you will also like the follow up movie: The Island. I don't think there will be too much of a difference, but it would have been nice to see more of his mother (who he sees a lot).   I hope this movie gets made for future generations!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have heard that "The Wizard of Oz" is a great movie. In fact, I'm a huge fan of "Dumbo" too (and I think "The Dark Crystal" was a little better). But, I think that "Duck" is better.   The story is great, and the musical score by Jack DeJohnette is just amazing. The music is almost like a dream, and it doesn't matter that you don't understand all the words, because the music is beautiful and sounds almost like the words would say. The story gets even better in the end.  I'm going to put in a note, that I'm not a big fan of children's movies, but I really enjoyed this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this film during a long time ago when it was on an earlier cable channel in the early 2000's.   It has a classic feel to it and I was surprised to find the soundtrack (although it was by another band) was good.  It features a good story and good acting by a couple of people that I liked a lot.  The story deals with a woman who falls in love with a priest, but then learns her father and brother have turned against her for all eternity.  I am not sure if this is an overused concept in horror movies, but it was done well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Citizen Kane" (1941) is a masterpiece of American cinema, which has been called a masterpiece because of its complexity, its profound, profound philosophical, psychological and philosophical views on human society and the human condition.   The film is about a man named Mark Twain (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a fictional character played by a real person (John Huston) who had been living on a New Jersey farm for many years. Mark is an American-born American writer who has a lot of money and wealth.  He has a good-looking wife (played by Elizabeth Taylor) and two beautiful children (played the two young actresses, Shelley Winters and Vivien Leigh). But, when an earthquake in his area destroys his home, he takes a job as a journalist at a daily newspaper. Mark writes a series of satirical articles about the "Maid of Orleans" who is an evil and grotesque woman. When the newspapers in the area are attacked by the evil and disgusting and depraved "Marianne", she gets hold of a book, written by Mark Twain, which is about the mythical "Majestic" who was supposedly the daughter of the god of thunder.  In this book, she tries to kill everybody in the world (except for the famous "Mama" in the United States who is trying to defend her children), but she has to stop at the place called "Citizens Kane" which is situated on a remote and lonely island. She takes a picture of a beautiful girl who is the only survivor of the shipwreck on "Cities Island", named "Mildred", because she was the one who survived the ship.  Her father is an old priest and she has been taken in by her grandmother.  Mildred is a shy and timid little girl who tries to hide her shyness and shyness makes her very lonely. She is constantly in fear of the evil "Maldor", but Mark tries to help her out of her loneliness. He tries to cheer her up and cheer her and try to get her friends to come over to "Cites Kane" to take a look at the pictures, but they don't want to go, even though they have a good reputation.  While he is trying, his wife, Elizabeth Taylor, is trying not to let him go to the island.  There are a number of "Citie's" that are based on real people, but their names were changed
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So far, the first of three films by the well-known director Michael Mann is a fine piece of cinema. As well as the usual mixture of violence, thriller, action and some comedy the film has a very effective theme: death. Mann, using the techniques of the masters, has created a film where the characters are shown dying a number of times. This is done so convincingly, it seems to take place in the movies; it has no need to be described. In all I really like Mann's films, but in this one I feel he really hit the bull's-eye with this one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I will watch this movie a lot more than I ever would have expected to.   The story line is great.  The movie has lots of different things going on at the same time and you just can't help but get caught up in it.  It is not a "filler" movie at all.  The action scenes are well done and it all seems very well done.  There is a very good story line.  This movie takes you on an action packed ride that you won't want to put down.  You should definitely get this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the series and I am going to admit it now. This movie is a total blast and if you love Buffy the Vampire Slayer this is a MUST SEE!!!   This is a great movie. I love how this was written. It starts off as a good story about a man named Ben and his struggle to become a better person. I loved the way Ben was portrayed. He is so flawed and has a heart that doesn't care about any person or things but is driven by his mission of becoming a better man. He meets his love interest named Willow and he starts having feelings for her and they start a romance and eventually start living together. However they are both going through hard times and he begins to have some doubts about his relationship with Willow. The rest of the film follows a love story between Ben and Willow and their friends and family. This is one of the best movies I have seen and the movie is worth watching. This story is so well done and it is a very emotional film. This could not have been made by a less talented writer.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen anything so funny and thought provoking in a long time. The film follows the life of a high school student with a bad case of nerves. He is one of those boys who makes a good impression and is a little bit funny, but at the same time seems rather pathetic. He lives in a small town but he has a special relationship with his school nurse, Helen. Her name is Margo. She helps him with his anxiety. When he is called to take the honors exam at school, he meets a girl named Betty (played by the great Joan Crawford). Betty is the most beautiful girl in the whole school. His nervousness gets to him and he makes a joke about a "nose that smells of a hot dog" and makes her cry. Then the class starts to wonder about his nose and the next thing he knows, he has lost his virginity to Betty. This was a clever film that I can not recommend too highly to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is set in an old, abandoned farmhouse where a widowed girl (Anne Hathaway) takes care of her children, a brother (Danny DeVito) and a niece (Holly Hunter). The niece's sister is a witch and is able to see auras and use them to her advantage in the house. The witch, named Rose (Michelle Williams) and her father (Peter Sarsgaard) are not well off. They spend a lot of money buying and selling farm animals. The girl and her brother find the farmhouse to be a dangerous place for a young girl to be, especially one who has just left a relationship. The two siblings eventually find the witch who is about to turn the farm house into her own personal dungeon, but not before some rather surprising events.

There are no guns, just rifles. It's an easy to watch movie and an awesome movie to watch. The movie is fun and the actors in it are great. I'm going to give it a 10 because there are some things that happen in this movie that could make you laugh.

But when you get to the last couple of minutes, it starts getting better.  I liked that it had a plot and a ending.  The actors had good chemistry and did the best they could.  This movie is rated PG but I didn't see anything that I would consider offensive.  It's a good children's movie and a good date film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is nothing wrong with this movie. There is not anything wrong with watching this movie in the early hours of the morning. There are some good and bad aspects to this movie but nothing is completely out of control or horrible.   The story is interesting. A man who has been diagnosed with mental illness loses his wife and child. He goes on a journey with a woman he met and they seem to have a good relationship. However this man is really out of his mind and it is a little hard to take this man seriously when he is making so many strange decisions. But after the woman dies he goes on another journey that eventually ends with him being in jail. This guy is really crazy.  This guy is crazy. I'm glad there was a movie with no sex in it about people with schizophrenia.  I did not like this movie very much. I will give it 3/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The second installment in the 'Crow' franchise (it's not a reboot, it's not an origin story, it doesn't even have the same name of the first movie) isn't bad, really.   But then, I was expecting something more.  In the first film, the idea was that the crow was actually a demon, who had been sent to Earth as punishment for murdering the leader of the crow clan, which would then be ruled by his brother.  Now we meet our hero, a soldier of the human side, who was sent to infiltrate the enemy's encampment to see what could be done with the crow.  After the first part, where the whole 'evil crow' thing gets started, and where the hero learns about his origins and the crow's origin, and also learns that the leader is actually an android, the plot gets a little bit more interesting.  Then, we get the second part, which is pretty much all about the 'evil' crow. The evil crow is a cyborg who wears a mask to conceal his identity.  He has an evil and sinister way of speaking, which, once you realize it, gets very disturbing (in a good way).  He seems to be an android because of his way of acting, because of the way his body looks, and he seems to have been sent from hell.  Also, he is the son of one of the most powerful and evil people in the universe, and I guess this is just what happens when people don't respect the system, do something that is outside the law, and then get destroyed by the system.  The cyborg, along with his mother and an army of cyborgs (I think) tries to destroy the humans, and, after all the evil they did, the human team tries to stop them.  It's a pretty decent story, and the cyborg is very scary.  But the plot itself is just... meh, it wasn't bad.  Like, the action scenes are pretty nice, especially when the cybran takes down a giant robot that looks like the giant robot from The Terminator.  And it's a good idea to have the evil crow actually get killed in some of the action sequences, but the ending is not as good.  To be honest, the ending of the second film is really lame.  I would have rather seen a movie where the cyrobos were defeated before the human group destroys

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was very well made, and at the same time I'm very disappointed about it:  Because of that I felt the film lacked emotional power and the plot and the characters were not well developed at all.   I think it was really sad to see that a movie like this is not appreciated at all by the people.  The actors were pretty good:  The actress who played Miss S is really beautiful.  She plays a really nice, kind girl who just wants to live the life she's had, to be free.  Unfortunately for her she is very ill and dying of cancer, but what happens to her after she dies is quite tragic.  If you were a little girl like her, this movie would make you sad.  But her husband is a real good guy:  I like the whole concept, the characters and the movie. I wish this movie could have been a great masterpiece and an important movie in the history of cinema.  Sadly, unfortunately, it wasn't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as the story goes, "The Room" is a movie that I found enjoyable to an extent. The characters are enjoyable, and the movie itself, as good as it is, is more about what the characters do with the room rather than what they do in the room. You don't see the characters as bad people, they don't act the way the movie wants you to see them act. In a way, you are rooting for the characters because they aren't acting as bad characters, they are just not what you expect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't like this movie as much as others but it does it job, in a way that's not so bad.   The movie is really good, from start to finish.  The first few scenes are really good but the story gets bad in the middle, but if you get a little behind, it's not that bad. The story was good, but the film gets soooo repetitive and boring in the end.  I think it's a really good idea that they wanted to do something new, and they did that, but I think they wasted a lot of time in doing it.  If they made a film with the same premise, it would have been a much better film, but they didn't take enough time.  As far as the music is concerned, they used great music, very good, I wouldn't change anything about it. The movie ended with a nice ending so I think that's good.  A film that has no redeeming features, nothing to get out of it, but it has a lot to offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      It's got a great cast and an overall good story. The script is well done and the acting is very well done. It is a classic American movie with a great plot.

The police find the victim lying in the parking lot with several cuts all over his body.  The story of a teen who is electrocute by a stray lightning strike, then found in a dead end and finds out he is the only survivor in a town of thousands is a very original story and the movie has a lot of good things to say about America.

It is one of those great movies that is so beautifully acted, and the plot was so perfectly thought out. There are not a few parts that you are so disappointed that the action does not match up to the plot and you have to sit through one or two unnecessary long scenes. The ending was a great payoff, and "The great escape" is a true masterpiece of a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I mentioned earlier, a few of the movies I have reviewed are my favorites (The Man From Earth is a personal favorite) but this one ranks right up there with them. It was a fantastic movie.   It was like an old time spy movie where a former spy is living as an ordinary man (but still with his spy skills) in an ordinary town.  This is one of the best spy movies I've seen in a long time.  It had all the ingredients I love about spy movies: suspense, espionage, a secret organization, a high tech weapon, and of course the suspense.  The plot is interesting, the characters are all wonderful, and the acting was superb.  There's even a scene where a terrorist threatens a group of people (I believe it was the "village people" of the movie).   All in all, a very good movie!   Rating: 4 out of 5  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll always remember the first time I saw the movie, the one that everyone is talking about.  I knew that this would be a good horror movie but I had no idea how good this movie would turn out to be!  I loved the movie!   The movie starts off really slow and with a very creepy feel to it.  Then it picks up steam and becomes much more enjoyable.   This movie is like a good old 90s horror movie, you have some scary moments, but mostly it's a very fun ride with a really cool and unique style of horror. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Marlon Brando, in all his great, grandiose, and glorious glory, appears to be trying to play a piano. But he is actually playing a typewriter. And to be honest with you, if he ever did play the piano, the music might be an awful lot better than the real thing. This, however, is a film about human beings living life. And it is not too much to say that this movie is a comedy. It's not too good a comedy, but it's the best comedy that Marlon has been able to come up with. It is a good piece of comedy. There are lots of laughs. There is even a moment of great sadness, when Marlon and a few of his friends have to leave the beach house where Marlon is living for a while because the landlord, an ex-patriot, has come down and taken over the place. There were lots of good jokes in this movie: The way that the landlord finds a way to make a living by taking care of the things that Marlin Brando doesn't like. The way in which the landlord's daughter can't decide whether to marry a man who doesn't wear a white hat or a man wearing one. The idea that Marli Brando does not like the idea of taking a woman out on a date to the cinema. There was also a real tragedy about a young man who is not very bright: a boy who is so depressed about his lack of a father that he doesn't want to go on a trip because he doesn the idea that he will be lost and alone. (One of the most powerful moments in the movie.) There was a bit where Marlo and his friends were talking about the people they hated, and one of them said: "The reason I hate people like him is because they don't have any heart. They are just like animals. But if there were a way I could find a man like him in a zoo, I'd go down there and I'd kill him. I would kill him." And there was a very touching scene about how a man tries to do the right thing, to be a good guy, and is killed for it by a drunk driver."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't really think that this is a good horror film, or a good supernatural movie for that matter. It's not bad, I'm sure it could have been better, and the concept sounds fun, but in the end it's just kind of boring. There's no real mystery, it's more a thriller than anything else. The pacing is very slow at points, and there's very little payoff. I found myself thinking to myself, "Well, why don't they just lock all the doors?" Well, I guess they did, but they could have made a few more clues a bit more obvious, and a bit less creepy. And of course, the final reveal isn't as great as the previous two, it seemed a little forced and rushed. And there was that little line in there that was supposed to be a great twist, but it just kind... got lost, and so it just felt like a cheap trick to keep us on our toes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie.   First off, it is based on a true story.  For those who are not familiar with the case, a little boy, 4, has been accused of having killed his father.  The prosecution alleges that he was angry because he had learned that he had to be a babysitter at his father's home.  At the time he was 7.  After a day and a half, the father returned home and said he had a surprise for him.  He told him that his little sister, 2, was being born.  His father gave him a knife and told him to kill himself.  Then, when the father left the house, the little boy picked up a large knife and went outside.  While walking home, the boy heard footsteps and stopped.  As he looked up, he saw a man standing in the street.  That man, who was dressed in black, had a long black beard.  In the film, the man appeared to be wearing a white nightcap, a black coat, a white coat, and a dark suit.  And, of course, he was in a black hat.  This man was a serial killer.  However, when he saw the little child, he didn't recognize him. And, then, when they arrived at the home of the father, he stabbed the mother to death.  It is also interesting to note that the father's brother, who knew his father was gay, was the murderer.  I thought this film did a great job of portraying the true story in a true, suspenseful way.  Unfortunately, the movie made many mistakes in that it portrayed the man as an angel, a victim, and the boy as an innocent.  But, overall, the plot was very well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that "The Big Lebowski" is one of the finest American comedies ever produced. It is one part "Chinatown" and two parts "Saturday Night Fever" in the best way possible. This is a very funny, very enjoyable movie with a good sense of humor. The film is very well acted with a very good cast. I give the movie 4 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A funny and very charming flick about a gay couple who go to Las Vegas, the place of their dreams. The plot is rather predictable but the funny parts are worth the ticket.   I'm a fan of John Travolta's and the cast of this movie is as good as it gets. Trav, Robert Redford and Paul Sorvino are the leading men here. This movie is a must see!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is set in the same universe as the other films in the series. In that universe, it is the late 1980s or early 1990s. The movie deals with a woman who has two little boys, a boy named David and a girl named Heather. Heather has an evil boyfriend named George, who is trying to control Heather. David is an athlete and gets into some trouble with George. When Heather's mother is murdered, David and Heather's dad leave her and head to Los Angeles. In LA, Heather is approached by an agent named Robert, who asks Heather to come to Los Angles, where he has an idea to make money. This plan backfires and causes some problems for David. Heather is being stalked by a group of men who want to murder her. However, after some help from her ex-boyfriend, David's plan works and Heather is able to escape from LA. Now that Heather is free, she has no choice but to run away from her troubles. David, however, is not so free and is forced to stay with the women who took care of him in LA. After a long time, David gets a call from an old friend, Mr. Brown, that he has a new girlfriend named Jessica. He finds out that she is having an affair with another man. At first, David is confused about his new girlfriend and does not want her to meet with him. However once David starts to get into an argument with Jessica, he realizes the two are in love and he has to go out on a date with her. When they are in the car, they are accosted by another man that is trying hard to force Jessica to have sex with him so he can gain the custody of her children. At the end, David realizes he needs Heather.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have not seen the "Lord of the Rings" films as an adult. There is a book about this movie, and a few of my friends have seen it too. The movie, with a large cast of "movie" actors, takes place in Middle Earth.   It takes place right in the middle of a war between the people of the Shire and the men of the Numenorean people.  To the west of the river, to the east of the River was a city called Erebor.  The city was built in the same manner as King Kong. They built the city with an earthen wall around the city and the city itself was surrounded by a moat.  A lot of soldiers and horses were hired from the Númenóreans.  There were not a lot of people who lived in Ereborg. People were not afraid to live in the land of the dwarves, and there were no enemies of the people in Erestor.  Once the dwarves made an alliance with the Shires, and were able to gain their lands.  That alliance was broken, and the Nuerinians attacked the people. The Dwarves took refuge in a small mountain, and called it Angband.  After Erestoth was destroyed by the Numeri and the Shiri'an. The people of Angband gathered a force of men and began to march northward.  As they marched through the country, they were attacked by enemies.   The people were forced to retreat and return to Ereborth. The Numerian and the King's men killed all the people and all the horses and killed the men as well. The survivors were captured.  Some of the men were released after the battle and became outlaws.  When they came back, they found a village.  An old man named Ecthelion told them that his grandfather had lived there before him. He told them what was left of his house and he led them into the house.  They found a chest that was buried with the family artifacts.  Among the things that he left with him was a ring.   His grandson gave the ring to the son of a friend of his son.  This friend of Ecthele's was named Thrain.  He went with the ring into a cave in the mountains. There was a stone door, and Thrain went down a path, and in the cave was a great cavern

This is the type of cookies that make you want to stay and enjoy a nice chat and a couple of cookies with her... The cookies were delicious and had a wonderful sweetness and flavor, however I would not have enjoyed them much if they were too sweet, however they were very tasty and would make for a good afternoon tea. We have a wonderful granddaughter at home with whom we can chat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few months back, when I found myself watching the first season of Buffy, I had a couple of thoughts on what a Buffy movie would be like. A lot of it is inspired by a really good book (and a few of it are very good), but it has a lot of elements that just don't feel right in a Buffy series, so I can't speak for how much they would work. What it does, though, is give a sense of "un-buffy" and a lot more about the town of Sunnydale, and a pretty cool scene with the Watcher who looks and acts like Willow.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It seems that some people love to point out that "they are all robots" or "they're all vampires", but I think it's a little more complicated than that.   The basic premise is that all of these aliens, aliens from a distant planet, have gathered on Earth, looking for a mate.  It's pretty obvious they don't think we'll take any of them.  I'm pretty sure they just want to look at the human race for a few minutes.  As you might imagine, the humans have never encountered aliens and are rather clueless about them, so they don"t even try to understand them at first.  The aliens have no trouble finding them though, and when they get here, they are pretty much immediately interested in taking a look at what we have.  However, they want to know how our planet was born.  We are all of course just happy to just see them.  The aliens start explaining to us about our world, the history of it, and so on.  It's pretty good, but not very convincing.  They explain everything really well, and even if you don" t believe anything they tell you, you get a little bit of a picture of our world and that it is different from theirs.  All of this is well-rehearsed and convincing, but there are a few problems.  One, most of the time the humans don" move around.  In most of them, the aliens actually get bored and just go about their business.  This is fine, but it's really odd.  What we see is all about the humans, but none of the humans really do anything in the movie.  Then the aliens start to ask more and more questions about the history and evolution of our planet.  If they could just stop being boring, this movie would be really good.  But instead they just seem to be bored and keep doing nothing.  And after a while, the film is pretty much over.  After seeing what the aliens can do, we decide not to let them come to us.  That doesn"t mean we don" give up on our Earth completely though.  Instead we do what they want, and it works pretty well for awhile.  So what"s the problem?  The problems come from the characters.  Well, I"m sure I don" have to tell you by now that these characters are pretty boring.  For

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had no idea how much I would enjoy this movie until it started playing.   In the first scene, they get a report that a plane crashed into an airport in the middle of a snow storm.  In a second scene, it's a movie about a man (played by a great actor, a character actor) who has to find a missing plane in the snowy landscape.    Then there is an amazing scene involving a car.  What is amazing about this movie is that it manages to convey a lot without being over-ambitious.  I was really impressed by it.  The characters have real depth to them.  I've never seen a movie like this that manages to have the action in the beginning and then go back to a character who is really affected by his circumstances.  This movie is a great way to see a great movie about two people who really care for each other and are really good friends.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a film about a character named Tasha, a teenager. She goes through a lot with her parents and boyfriend. When she discovers an old photo album in her room her dad shows it to her. There is a bunch of black and white photos from her childhood and in it she has three very pretty girls. All of them are black. They are holding hands. She was really happy with them. Her mom is upset when she finds out about them. This movie has some good points. You can say this is like a film from the 30's, or you can say it is a time of change. When you have people who are very poor and people who have a different outlook on life they all look pretty much the same. This is also a film of people who had to work hard and do things in a very small place. The whole movie is about how you could have lived better lives if you had to, but you just never had the opportunity. It was a wonderful little story about a girl who has been brought up by her father who has a very good relationship with his children. It is a good little story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film about the life of a young man in the North Pole during the winter, when the ice is still too thick to travel on the roads. This is one of those films that just shows what the future is going to be like, with the use of modern technology and new equipment. And of course there is a scene of the old time way of life, with sled dogs that use their sleds, and that is an old movie with a lot of humor in it.

I liked the story and the characters were well done.  There were alot of scenes that were just like they were on a normal TV show.  They showed some awesome acting and they even showed a little bit of action scenes! I loved this movie!   If you like sci-fi/adventure/crime/horror movies this is the movie for you.  If this is all you've ever seen then you are in for a treat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most other people who love the original (even though its not really a remake at all), i was surprised that it managed to be very faithful to the original, and the result was a very entertaining movie which i really enjoyed watching.   As i said in the intro, it was my first movie which had been on TV in a while so i was really surprised to find out that it was a remake.  And to be honest, it doesn't really matter whether it is a remake or not, because the results are the same.  It's an enjoyable romp and an enjoyable movie.  There are some good lines, but there are a lot of bad ones, so some people would probably not enjoy this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited for this movie.   This movie is about a young man (Dane DeHaan) who is an orphan and his new foster-family.  He lives with them in a trailer.  His foster-mom (Kate Winslet) takes him to the movies (like I said...a pretty standard summer movie) and then he has a problem with the girl who is the foster-mother and then the problem gets worse.  The boy is called "Mr. Peanut" by the foster parents and has a nasty reputation.  When the foster moms go to work he makes fun of the kids and they tease him, so he is not too happy.  But he seems to enjoy it when his new playmate calls him Mr. Peppy and he laughs a lot and the kids enjoy themselves, but that is the last straw for him.  Then he meets the new foster brother (played by Ben Stiller).  They do a lot of bonding activities and then they begin to date.  They have an almost secret love life but he is still a loser and Mr. Peanut gets annoyed when he finds out and they go their separate ways.    So now he lives on his own.  So Mr.Peanut goes to the mall to get some snacks.  A nice guy comes up to him and offers him a ride.  Mr.Pebbly agrees and they head for the mall.  He is in a nice place when he sees a beautiful woman.  She gets angry at Mr. Pebbly for "hating" her and she kicks him.   But he doesn't care about that at all because he is just having a good time.  And that is when the story gets really good.  In the car, she gets angry because he calls her Mr. Sweet Peanut.  You see a little scene of them getting out of the car and then she tells him that she's a very sweet girl and then when he does his "sweet" voice, she does a quick turn and goes back to Mr.Dumb Peanut and then calls him Ms.Sweet.   So then she leaves Mr.Bubbly behind because she wants to do it all over again.   He tries to cheer her up by telling her that he loves her very much and then again says he loves you and then finally decides to say it all out loud and says that he doesn´t love you
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What an amazing movie!   It really is amazing.   I just hope the film does not make a comeback,   because I truly believe it should,  and if it does then I hope it gets a sequel or three or four   more.  For a movie about a man who makes a movie that makes a man out of him, it is really a good thing that he doesn't do all the movies by himself.  The story, especially the ending, is really good.  I would love to see more from this guy.  And I know he wants more money than all the other men in the world and I'm so happy that he is getting it because it is a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best films I have seen so far this year and the third installment in a series about a young girl named Jessica that grows up in the slums of New York. This movie has a really unique plot that involves a rich young girl, Jessica, who is getting married and moves to the Upper East Side, where she meets her fiance, Ben (David Thewlis), and his father, and their lives are changed. The story of the film is about the changes that Jessica makes, and how she discovers her love and compassion for Ben's father. The film is pretty amazing, and well-acted as well. If you like a good mystery, this is the movie for you.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My son's a huge fan of movies, and this is one he absolutely loved!   The story, although somewhat dull, is not as bland or flat as it could have been. The movie was told in a voice over, so some of the dialogue was unintelligible, but the character acting was very good and the story was captivating.   This movie has so much character in it, and I can't even remember the characters off hand, but I definitely recall the two little boys, and all of the fun, excitement and joy the kids had.

I would say it is a very good movie and if you like some people with bad temper then I would recommend this movie as it is well written and made by a good director and cast with good actors and the story line is the most interesting I have seen for a while.    It is well worth a watch and I think is worth it as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My brother's best friend (and the only good one he has) is getting married on Saturday! My friend thought she could borrow the car and drive it all around to meet her friend at the ceremony, but she got a flat tire. After much arguing, she realized there wasn't anything she could do to get the car back. It was too late anyway, so she drove to a place called the "Merryland Inn" to find a mechanic to fix the car. I was with my brother at the time, and I was in shock that my friend could drive the car like that. I'm so glad my brother was there to give her advice! He knew all about cars when he was young, and he taught my sister and me about cars. When we saw her driving the car, I had to laugh. I mean, she could barely hold a key in her hand to drive the thing. She was too embarrassed to drive in the rain! After all that hard work, she got her car back! So happy for her! She was a very good girl. My brother was glad that her friend was there for her, so he said they should go back there. They found the mechanic in the back room. He said the problem had to do with the gas tank. He had to cut the gas lines so the gas could get to the tank. I don't think it will be a problem with that old car. My sister has a nice figure, and she looks like a Playboy model! When my brother said that they should come back to the Merryland Inn for a second repair, she couldn't stop laughing.

This song has a very unique sound which I find really catchy. When the film begins the movie has a nice mood. You'll find that this is not a scary movie at all. This movie will give you a good time and a good laugh. I'm sure that you'll enjoy the movie very much.    - October 13, 2007What a funny movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie. When I heard of the original, I thought it sounded like a cross between a black comedy and a comedy, but with a lot of humor thrown in there as well. The acting is great, and the story is very good. It's about the death of a beloved, but a very tragic, character. It is told from several different points of view. From the perspective of a young man, who loves and misses him very much. As he looks at pictures of his dead father, of a life he had lived and loved, of his friends and of their parents. From a young woman, who sees a chance for a normal life, and becomes one of the people closest to the death, and at the same time, becomes a target for his enemies. From an older man who is still in love with his son, and is trying to deal with his wife's suicide. From his daughter, who is in denial about her father's death, tries to forget about him. And finally, from an old man who looks on his life with some bitterness, as a great loss, and finds himself in a place he never expected to find himself.   When the film was first released, it was received by many people as a classic, and to this day, it still holds that title. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all the years I have been in Hollywood, I have never met such a brilliant director who never took himself too seriously. He knows exactly how to capture the mood of a scene, and all the best of the action scenes, with perfect synchronization and perfect transitions, but most importantly he knew how to convey emotion and sympathy through an excellent cast.   (See also: The Perfect Storm )   I can't tell you how many people have told me that I should come to Europe to see some of the best films in Europe and that it is a shame I am too young to see it.  I really don't know whether I'll ever see a better movie.

The storyline of this movie is so well thought out, it has a real message, and it all makes sense, not only that, but it doesn't try to tell you a story, just shows you the characters, and how they live their lives, which is great!   There are some wonderful performances in the film, such as the two lead actors in the movie, the other actors are really great, and give their characters a real feeling, and real life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only way I can describe this film is a mixture of "The Terminator", "Terminator 2" and "Aliens." "Wake" is very similar to "Alien." The film opens with a giant "alien" (as seen in "Alien") who has arrived in our planet with a deadly weapon in his hand. He has a giant monster (again seen in Alien) on his back and we are in for a very exciting ride. The camera work is also outstanding, making the characters very unique and interesting to watch. The voice acting is also amazing. The acting by most of the actors in this film are very good. The supporting characters are all very interesting as well. The sound track is also good.   "Wakes" has an outstanding script. There are a few action scenes, but they aren't anything out of this world. The story was interesting and I could easily see myself watching this film again, especially after having seen "Alien" and this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this film because I read a review here that stated it was a good flick to watch while riding the subway. It was, and I watched it.   A good movie to watch in the subway, for sure!   The main character, Daley, is a little bitty guy, who is trying to figure out what the world is like. He is not much of a thinker, and usually tends to get lost in whatever he is doing at the moment. But, a young girl, played by a pretty, young, pretty little girl (Sofia Boutella) makes sure he does find himself again. The two do get along well. They just have different opinions, and Daley ends up leaving her. But it is just another thing in a long line of things he does to try to get away from the bad stuff he is going through. It is hard for him to get out of his head, but he does, and it's all good. The story is interesting. It's also kind of tragic, but at the same time you are rooting for him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie by J. G. Ballard, The Incal was a really cool sci-fi movie. I don't know much about the sci- fi genre, but I like all the stuff that's been done in that genre in the recent years. If I didn't like movies and sci- entific stuff, I'd be very bored. The movie opens with a woman sitting on a bed, talking to her friends about the new guy she sees every other day. All the people in the room seem to be the same; the same clothes, the same hairstyle, thesame attitude, etc. After some time passes, a couple of friends of the woman's, who is being approached by the guy every other night, go in and tell her that her "date" will be on at any moment. The guy comes into the room and they get to know each other, then the guy tells the woman that he is about to propose to her, but that it is not yet a legal marriage, because they are not sure about the laws on the matter. The man and woman sit on the bed and talk and the woman begins to be worried, since she doesn't want a divorce, and he says it will be OK. And then the couple have a little sex and she is happy, when she goes back to her friend, she discovers that the guy has left her and gone to a bar, she doesn 't know what to do. She begins to cry and the friend tells her that she doesn' t need a man, she has the perfect man, her husband (or husband-like man) and it's a beautiful marriage, it has been all like this all along. I really liked the ending of this movie, they don't marry each other after all, they just continue to spend time together with each other.   "The Incal" is a really good movie to get your mind involved with. This one will keep you thinking about it for a long time, it's like a movie in your head.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely blown away by the first half of the film. It was a very well-written, intelligent, well-acted film. It is the kind of film you could just sit back and enjoy.   The acting and storytelling are both excellent. I really enjoyed this film. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good story, a good film, or just a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first part of the film is about a group of people going to a rock concert. The band is led by a guy named Tom Jones, who doesn't get much attention from the girls. He seems to just be having a good time. He goes to a little bar called the Wild Man and is asked to join them. He agrees to go along with the band and they get a huge crowd in the room, but that crowd soon gets a little smaller, so they decide to split up and go off to different areas. During this period, Tom Jones tries to find out a girl he likes who's there with the guys. They eventually run into a girl named Sharon who is also part of this band and she has this really weird crush on Tom. The film ends on this pretty sweet scene when a group is sitting around one night. They are enjoying themselves and making out in the same room with a groupie called Nancy who is a very beautiful girl with blue eyes and long brown hair.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was completely blown away by the original Spider-Man, and by the sequels as well, so I wasn't sure how I would feel about Spider-Woman, but I couldn't be happier with the way that she was handled.   While the movie had some good action sequences, it also had a lot of character development, which made me care about her.  The story was very funny as well as the character.  As for the actual spider-woman, she did look cool!   Her spider-sense was pretty cool and I like how she wore a black t-shirt, and had her black hair in a braid. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was lucky enough to see this film in the theater a few times when I was a teenager.   It has some really funny moments, with some genuinely funny scenes, a bit of bad acting.  It also has some pretty dark moments, and some very disturbing images.  This movie is a bit depressing, but I can't put it down. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cast is a little weak, and not really very interesting, but this movie is more about the people who live in the community. The main character, Billy Smith is a guy who has to go home to his family and his wife. While living his daily life, a little town, with a little community, starts a small war between the "good people" and the "bad people" of the neighborhood, and Billy must help defend his neighborhood from the bad people.   I am a huge fan of the movie "Tales from the Hood" (1981), and I am glad to see that director Steve Miner is still around.  He makes a movie that you really look forward to.  I can not give this movie a good rating because it is not really a good picture, but it is fun, and you do enjoy it if you like the films of Steve Miner, and if you are a fan of his films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorites from the 1970's, The Great Escape features a young woman named Barbara Stanwyck who tries to escape her life on the "Cape Cod" in the backwoods of Maine. She goes to a school for delinquents run by the cruel teacher Miss Evers, who forces the boys to work at the school. Barbara ends up working on the farm as a farmhand and ends up falling in love with one of the students named Sam. After Sam is found murdered in a barn the girls are left at the mercy of the corrupt teachers who have set up a school.        It's a good comedy and it was a very good film at the time.  It was a hit in the US and it's one of my all time favorites.  What do I love about this film? Well I love the first few minutes when Barbara first meets Sam. It's so sweet!  And what about the film itself? Well there is a bit of a story and it is told with the dialogue of the film.  After being found dead Barbara and Sam are taken back to the teacher's school where the principal Mr. Spence tries to make her believe that she did all the right things.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the greatest movies in cinema history! The film depicts the life of a young man named Jeff Lebowski, a poor, alcoholic, but not entirely stupid, loser who is drawn into the world of high finance and the world-famous film set up by Jeff's friend Walter Sobchak.   Like a good friend I will watch this movie again and again, and for me the best part is the beginning when Jeff first meets the girl who would become his wife. I was really surprised that no other scenes were filmed, and I liked it when they did the "mosh" to start the movie, but again there's nothing that I want to see from the rest of this movie.  It was good that they filmed the first scene in front of a beautiful lake, I could picture a bunch of actors sitting around a pool talking.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story and characters are quite good and they do not need to be shown in the original animation, so the scene with the guy riding in a train will always remind us of old movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film made me laugh a lot.   The film starts off with a great scene where the young lady's grandmother comes to visit.  Then, the grandmother tells her that when she was young, the lady was a beauty and a woman.  When she was a young girl she would help her grandmother in the garden and make sure that the house was clean.  Finally, she went out to the street where she used to walk.  Her grandmother asked her why she was still going to school when she used her hands to clean up the house.  The girl said that she was only going to the city to study for a while.  She told her grandmother that she just wanted to leave it behind her forever.  A couple of years later, the girl's grandmother dies and she takes over the business of the house and the garden.  Once the girl has learned all the tricks to live in the world with her hands, she takes the whole family to the country to live with the father and mother.  Later, when the girl wants to go home and have some time off, she goes to visit her grandfather.  As soon as she is out the door, her grandmother asks her why they are going to visit a ghost and a ghost is an old person.  That is when the grandmother asks the girl to put her hands on the top of the window of her grandfather's house.  This scene was very funny to me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is actually very good! I found it funny, and it wasn't over the top. The way they did it was great. It wasn't a movie that will get you to laugh a lot and it didn't make you want to take off your shirt. It was a movie which was kind of slow and made you wonder why they hadn't moved away from the whole blood-sucking-cock and sex thing. But if you don't like that stuff then you might like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't love this movie, but I'll watch it again, because it's good.   There is a scene in the end where the boys' mom and dad come home to a huge mess they made of their house.  He doesn't seem to be too happy about it, but the boys go to bed early so they can make it up to him tomorrow.  Then the kids talk about how the mother is leaving them soon, and the dad says it is their fault she left them, because the boys are being bad, and they have to grow up.  One kid says he will grow up to be a nice guy.  It's a bit too long, but it's a decent movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I went out to dinner in a downtown area. We ate out at a Mexican place, which was an excellent choice, especially for the fact that we were both new to Mexico.   It was a beautiful sunny afternoon and we looked forward to seeing the view of the city and perhaps taking a walk through some of the more famous parts of the historic centre. We sat at a table on a patio, where a waiter came over to the table and asked if we were ready to order. "A la carte," I replied, "I'd rather just get some food." "I'm not going to serve you anything," he replied. "We can just take what we want." "We're not going for anything. Let's just order what we need and go." The waiter came back and said, "If you're not ordering anything, I'm not serving any of it." We decided that that was a good way to start, and ordered tacos, a small steak, a veggie dish and a chocolate milkshake, and a glass of chardonnay. The food arrived in very good condition, though we couldn't find anything that could be considered authentic, with the exception of the steak. It was certainly not the best steak I've ever had, though it was certainly a good size for two people, and it came with a large side of vegetables, potatoes and sweet corn. All three were good, but the veggie was the only one that came with the requisite amount of cheese. We both preferred the chocolate milshake. It had a wonderful chocolate taste to it, and was quite filling.  Posted by Kari F on 08:46 AM I was wondering about this movie. I know I have seen it a few times but I never had a chance to review it. I always enjoy watching a good film and this one was no exception. I have a feeling that it is not an easy watch, even though there isn't anything too difficult about it. However, this movie is very dark and very disturbing. I would not recommend watching it if you are easily disturbed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many, I saw the documentary "The Thin Blue Line." This movie is a gripping, compelling, and fascinating exploration of the circumstances surrounding a case in which two unarmed black men are killed while serving in the US Army. The movie tells the story of how this tragedy is brought about and how it has affected the men's families. It shows the grief of the families of the victims, the families who lost their loved ones, and the families that lost their friends and loved ones. The film also tells the life story of David J. Dowling, a military veteran who was awarded the Bronze Star for valor and was decorated with the Purple Heart, for which he has received numerous awards since his military service. He was the second person killed that day, and he was killed in the backseat of a moving vehicle, where he was trying to save two unarmed, African American boys. Both the victim and victim's relatives are interviewed, and are shown the photographs taken by a camera hidden in the windshield of a police car. It is these photographs that were to come to be the basis for Dowling's murder. The two boys were killed after trying to help Dowling in his attempt to flee from the police car, but it did not work out in their favor. The police cars that were involved in the killing were not at fault, but what led to the killings was that the police were not following proper police procedures by not stopping when they had a probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed. The incident was widely reported in the news, and for a period of time, the entire town was in a frenzy over this unfortunate incident. Many people were disturbed by the sight of unarmed black boys being gunned down by a police officer who thought he was in danger of being killed himself. Dowler's death was an incident of racism, and a reflection on American society. This is a powerful documentary that can be watched and viewed in multiple ways. The first way that I watched the film was as a crime scene report. The details that are depicted in the film are a very disturbing and disturbing story. For example, I had not watched the movie when a report was shown in which one of the police officers showed a child that had been severely burned on his body. The child was a victim of an explosion caused by a homemade incendiary device, which the police officer used to set himself on fire to try to cover up the truth about the actual incident. The children, and their families,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of David Lynch and have seen him in a number of films and on the TV series, but this is the best.   I was so excited to see what he had in store for me and I got to see it all.  This was an amazing movie.  It was dark and disturbing but also beautifully shot and filmed.  It really put me in a state of mind that was very uncomfortable and very weird but also very beautiful.  I enjoyed it very much.

So much of the story is told in the first person, and there is a sort of mystery going on, as you figure out how the world really works.   This is another book that I am very excited to watch, as I am fascinated with how the magic works.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie at least 10 times and it is still a great movie and I loved every minute of it.   This movie will stay in my favorite movies of all time.  This is one of the funniest movies of any kind that I have ever seen.  The movie opens with some guys going to a bar called "the Blue Bar" with one of them is called Jim and he is a very big, muscular guy. The other guy is called "Jim" and he's not that much bigger than Jim but he is an expert athlete. They are playing basketball and the next thing you know they are in bed with a woman who isn't a woman.  There is a lot of sexual innuendos and the guy who's called "Mr. Giggles" makes a lot jokes and the two guys are so horny that they don't give a rat's ass about the woman who is in bed next to them and who is the only thing in this movie that looks human.  In a great scene a guy named "Eddie" is out hunting with his friend Eddie.  Eddie is a small man who is very handsome and in one of his fights Eddie kills a big bear with one punch. Eddie decides to have sex with the bear but the bear decides that Eddie is not so handsome and he goes into a rage and attacks Eddie. Eddie gets into a fight with the man and then the bear jumps Eddie and his friend and Eddie is killed.  So a dead guy who is a good sport gets his revenge.  If you like a good laugh and a nice movie, this is the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an American war movie about the Battle of the Bulge. It's pretty good with a good action scene that is not too long at the beginning. I'm looking forward to it because it's like what I remember about the German side. It looks good and it's more of a tank movie than a tank battle. The movie is also really exciting to watch. If you're a fan of war movies then this should be a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was a good enough movie to make up for the previous ones I had watched with my friends. The first two were good (though the first one was too long) and the third was okay. And the fourth was just a waste of a film.       So I have to say the worst part of this movie was not the boring, but the stupid things the kids did. When the old woman tells them about her son, the old lady's child is being carried off by a huge bird like bird. She wants to kill it, and the kid yells "Don't kill me!" When she gets to him, he is in his underwear. And she says he's going to be a big bird for the next 10 years and that will make his penis look like a penis. They walk out the door and when they get to their car, the guy in the passenger seat is wearing a tiny red thong. So then the old ladies drive off and when the kid says "Look, there's a giant bird," he just sits on his butt and tells his mom to shut up and that's the way he is. I thought the old women were supposed to be the good guys. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent animated film with some very moving moments.   "The End"   This movie has it all: heart-warming, funny, heart-wrenching, intense, emotional and, of course, some nice animation.  The story is about a little bird named "The Bird" that has no memories of who he is or how he came to be, and finds a small cottage with three sisters, a mother and a little boy. The boy's name is "Fred". The Bird is not a real bird, he is actually a small dinosaur who lives inside the cottage. Fred is about 10 feet long and his name is a play on the words of the old English rhyme "He was a blackbird and he was a crow." It's a story about a young boy who has a mysterious past, the meaning of which is not as simple as it seems. He has a small "moustache" but he isn't a bird.  It's about a real, tiny bird that has an unusual history and a strange life that is filled with strange events that lead to his escape from his home.  A short, cute and heart-touching film that will keep you on the edge of your seat as you follow the story of Fred and the bird who is waiting for his next journey. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie that has no plot, I liked it a lot and I don't know why.   It's basically a story about a guy trying to catch a girl who is trying to sneak off by flying a plane.  It was like a movie about a person trying to get to the top of a cliff and get to a girl they like.  This movie wasn't that good but for a first movie I thought it was cool.  It's a girl pilot who flies by herself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very funny film that is a homage to the classic Hollywood "I know it when I see it" type of movies.   This film is all about the movie that never is, a comedy about a movie that always was.  The story is interesting and funny in the beginning of the film, however the movie takes a turn for the worse towards the end of the movie.  It is not all the movie has done, and not much of a comedy either.  At one point the actors are asked to go to lunch with a group of people they would never be able to talk to again, this leads to the film being a little more "silly" and childish than you might think, but it is still a very entertaining watch.  A nice blend of comedy and drama.  I am giving this movie four stars and it is well worth the price of admission. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Casting is good.   In an interview with David Ayer, he talks about how the actors played the part of the criminals:  " The other actors do a great job of making you root for the bad guys, and you really hate them and wish they'd get their just deserts.  And there are some great cameos by Tom Sizemore and John Leguizamo.  "   I really like the idea of the cops being bad guys.  I like the notion that they get caught in an accident and they're locked up with some other bad guys and it's the cops' job to make it so they don't get out.  An action scene, an actor who is very good, and a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   The story starts out really funny.  When we see the protagonist, Ben, he is running a business with a friend, who is always giving him a hard time.  As we are watching him, we get to know him a little better and the humor is good.  One of the things that really made the movie funny, was that Ben constantly had to stop and say hi to the girls, who always made fun of him.  So Ben had to learn to take a joke, because the girls are the butt of the joke a lot.  We all know girls are funny but what this movie had was an honest comedy and a love story, at times.  The relationship between Ben and his girlfriend, Mandy is a beautiful love story.  Mandy has a great body, and the other girl, Lisa, is a very attractive girl.  They are all happy together and Mandy gets to be the girlfriend.  It was a very happy movie, that was easy to watch.  I was happy to see that they did not show Ben as a loser, because this movie was a happy movie. The acting is very good. All the actors have a good sense of humor. The movie ends at a funny way.  There is some good sex in the movie. It was pretty well done and I enjoyed it.  This is a good film, and a good start to a good season.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a real life story of two girls (Shanice and her little sister Jael), who live in a small town in the middle of the desert with their grandparents. The story is not what one would think if they heard about a girl being taken from her family in Iraq and sent back to her home in the US, without a father or a mother and living with her grandparents. However, the story is based on real events that actually happened to the Shanice and Jael family. Jael was just 5 years old at the time of the events. The film shows the Shanies at home and when they go to school and what it is like being a kid. The movie also shows the real life events of the characters that happened when the war in Iraq started. I really enjoyed this movie and I would love to see the movie a second time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think there is much to say about this film. I have watched it several times and enjoyed it each time.   This film was released in 1971 when there were very few female lead characters in the films produced. It is really nice that the female lead is portrayed by Judy Garland.  The plot of the film is rather simple.    In the 1940's a woman, named Dorothy Gale, and her husband move to a small town in Colorado. They are living in a house with three children. A mysterious man from the future comes to town with an offer to the Gale family:  One week from today they have a new baby boy. This is great for Dorothy and her family. They all get together and are all excited. They start looking for the boy and go searching for him.  Once they find him he is not what they expected. He is the son of a very rich man and is not happy with his situation.  He wants to get back to the future, the time before the war when he lived in the past.  They must leave the present time and the Gale's try to get the boy back.  I just like the ending when Dorothy gets a message from the woman in the future. She says Dorothy has a chance to live out her life and she must be willing to make her way back. After the time in the old time she can be the woman she wanted to be.  It was my first time watching a movie I was not too impressed with, but it was an interesting film.  This was a great movie to watch for the time it was made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes place in an alternate universe where a nuclear war has ravaged the Earth, including the fictional town of Blackpool. Two young actors play young lovers who have to hide their love from their relatives in an effort to preserve their families, and the movie does a good job of this. Unfortunately, Blackpool is a small, tight knit town, and all of the people who lived there are deceased. This means that any attempt at romance or any attempt to maintain an existing relationship will be futile. A good story could have been written here, but the plot simply drags on to no end, with little explanation of why things are the way they are.   I wish that a better plot and better characters could have made this a good flick.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure why I haven't seen this movie yet, and I probably will not until it comes out on DVD. But I'm glad I saw it.   This is a fun, raucous movie with a good soundtrack and a few really funny lines.  When they were in the process of making this movie, they wrote a script and then they wrote the actors to play parts that they thought were funny.  I found the cast to be pretty funny, and it really was fun to watch this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen "The Big Red One" about a dozen times.   A little over 2 hours long, and very well shot and edited, as well as being a good thriller.  One of the most intense action films I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little sad at the end (aside from the end). The film has a great premise, but the performances are pretty average. I feel like the actor portraying the little girl wasn't very good at portraying this child.   It's a shame that this is a film that I have not seen, but I have heard a lot of people raving about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't think I'd be doing another review on the movie until this one came out...but it's well worth the watch! I have no idea how long this film will last, it doesn't seem like it's going to go on forever. You can tell this is a love story, there are lots of different emotions flowing through the audience as they watch the couples come together for the first time. I thought it was an excellent romantic story and it's nice that the main character is a little like a dream. It's interesting to see the various types of men she meets in the world and you can tell she has a good sense of humour about herself. I really liked the way she handled the situation and her interactions with everyone in the story. It doesn't really matter if they are men or women because she still falls for them. The last act was probably my favourite part of the film. You have all these characters that are in this film with their own agendas and agendas, but it's really not an overly dramatic film at all. I think it's just a great love story with lots of love and emotion, and I think you'd get the same feeling if you saw the movie at the right time of day. It feels very romantic and it gives you a great feeling of satisfaction when the couples finally meet. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves love stories or has a crush on someone.

It had a pretty good story line and I don't know why but I felt more attached to the main character then I would normally expect from a movie, she really did seem very believable. The characters are very realistic, no stupid one-liners, they had a real life struggle and a lot of pain. The movie wasn't all about the action, there were still some things that were interesting to see, like the man who lost his home after a flood, the farmer, and the guy who was trapped in his house, as he tried to save his family. The soundtrack was really good as well. I found myself listening to it all the time, but not because the movie was so good. It's a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who has a strong opinion about a movie being made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know how good I'd find this one until I finally sat down and watched it. It's actually not that bad.   The pacing was pretty good and it's fun to watch, though I think the fact that there are no good guys is a bit ridiculous (I think this is the only way a guy could ever be a good guy).   A few of the songs were a bit weird, but this was a fun film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first 30 minutes of this movie are great, with a great main villain and a beautiful film by David Lynch. The movie was created with great care and attention to detail. I love David Lynch as a director, I can't think of anything he does that hasn't been amazing.   This movie does not follow the book perfectly, but it's close enough.  This is probably the only film I ever saw that felt right in my head.  I can appreciate it more when I actually read the book, because I love his characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "As an example of what happens when the police fail to take action against serial killers, The Silence of the Lambs features the same sleazy plot that has been made into a film several times, though without a good deal more wit or the requisite 'charm'."   http://www.movieguide.com/reviews/silence_of_the_lambs/movie.html   http://www2.pittsburgh.edu/bio/sherwin_d/dickson.html The silent movies: their origins and significance I'm not sure what to make of this entry into the "silent" movie canon.   In the late 1950s, James Stewart, a screenwriter working for the studio Twentieth Century Fox, made a few attempts at making a film about the life of Henry Lee Lucas, a murderous killer of two young women in Philadelphia.  The film, written by George Roy Hill, was titled The Killer, and was an attempt to portray the real-life story of Lucas and to portray him as an interesting figure who made a bad impression on his younger sister (played by Barbara Stanwyck).  Lucas' wife, Lillian, was not only the mother of Lucas' two daughters, and a woman of great emotional strength and moral force, but she was also a talented artist and a talented pianist who worked at a piano store, where Lucas sometimes worked as a janitor.  Lucas was also an accomplished painter and a successful entrepreneur, who lived on the corner of South 18th and South 17th streets in Philadelphia from 1942 to 1953, but was mostly living on the top floor of a house at the end of South 17 street, which was his home during that time, although he would stay in his mother's house for a few days here and there.  This was the time of the great Depression and the beginning of the Cold War.  Lucas was the sort of person who went about his business in an unassuming manner, but at the same time he had a lot of personality and a real interest in the arts.  He was not a wealthy man, but he could afford to have a small but pleasant apartment with a living room, a bedroom with a piano, and room for a small cabinet and a sink.  At some point, Lucas's former wife Lillian began a relationship with a man named Tom Selleck.  It was not uncommon for

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pretty excited to see the trailer. When I saw this I was like wow this movie was so funny and i was so happy with it. I loved it. The plot is that a guy who is married and is trying to keep his marriage going and tries to make it a better marriage by making his wife better and more confident and all of the things he tries in that he has to keep her from feeling like she is in a bad place. When her friends come to his place they think it is weird that she is going to the mall and he thinks it is a good idea to ask his friend to come in the room with him. And she does and he is trying in all kinds of ways to seduce her. And his friends say that he is wrong and he should get rid of her. So when he comes up with a plan to get rid her of her friend. But when his wife comes home and is in no mood. His friend is in the same mood and comes over and starts trying to kiss her and make her feel like she has to be more like her. He makes her feel good about herself and she wants to know what the guy is doing and her husband is like oh there is a big duffel bag and he said it was full of something for the wife to change and she needs it. But I don't know what it is he says and I thought the guy was going to say it was like a big pile of money or something like that but when I got to the duffell bag and I got the little bit that was like money inside it and I couldn't get it out of the bag. And I asked my husband what the heck was that and I think the guy said something like get out of my way. And then I told my husband to get out and put it back in the duffle bag and my husband was like you know that can't be. But it was a duffelt bag.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie several times in its original version with a new English dub. I find that the new dub is a good improvement. Some actors sound better than they really are (Jade Ealy in particular has no business sounding like a prostitute or a bad mother), but there is a lot of good dialog in the new English dubbed version.   This movie is good because it's about a guy who has never been a bad guy. He's not a rapist or a sadist or a monster. He just has never seen anything like what he is about to do.  What he does is something truly bizarre, and something not to be understood by the innocent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title is self-explanatory: an alien is captured by a group of scientists, but they manage to learn a lot about the alien. They realize it is intelligent, so they try to get it to reproduce, but it doesn't. In the end, they have to make an artificial brain from a brain of another, and then they decide to keep it alive and give it a brain. It becomes self-aware and manages to escape.   It's a fairly good movie in the sense that it has the right idea in mind, but a lot of things go wrong.     A few issues: The main character is supposed to be an android, but the android's voice doesn't sound human.  There is a bit of violence (shoving a baby against a wall and trying to kill it with a nail clipper), but it's not too bad.  Some of the actors are great, but some seem a bit too old.  The ending is not very satisfying and leaves the audience very confused about the movie.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot and recommend it to all sci-fi fans!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Thing"   Written and directed by James Van Der Beek and starring Chris Cooper (in his first role in a blockbuster movie), Peter Weller (in a big blockbuster movie and on a high), and Sigourney Weaver (on a high, she is), "The Beast" is a masterpiece of a science fiction film and has never been bettered.   At a time when a woman was able to survive the most terrible conditions on the most inhospitable of planets, "The World," the film follows her as she attempts to make the best of her situation. It seems that she is going to make it, for all the time the creatures around her have.  The Beast is, in a word, a masterpiece.  It is a film of grand scale and complexity, with a cast that is truly superb.  But the star is Sigourney's performance, which, coupled with the excellent script by Van Der- Beek, sets the tone for a film that is quite wonderful.  There is not a dull moment in this film.  I would say that Van DerBeek and his co-writer, Richard Matheson, have given us a film about a man and a woman, which has a wonderful balance of suspense, drama, action, adventure, romance, and science fiction, with the elements of horror thrown in for good measure.  Like "The X-Files," "The Things We Carried" deals with a world which is in a state of transition, from the present to the future.  And like "The Lone Ranger," "Terms of Endearment" is about a character who is a true classic, someone whose character has developed over the course of the film.   Peter Wellman as The Thing, a personification of evil, is a superb character.  What has always fascinated me about Wellman's performances, particularly in the two films of his that I have seen (most recently "The Man Who Fell to Earth") are his expressions.  In both "The Evil Dead" and "Memento," he was able, when he wanted to, to express just a hint of sadness in his eyes, or to show genuine, but not exaggerated, grief.  He has done the same thing here.  This film is about the character of The Thing (a character I know is not really real), and it is the actor's role to bring out this essence of the character and bring
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movie I've seen in a long time. The plot is very simple but it really is very interesting. I have not seen many good and original movies like this one. I really love the actors, but there is no special plot. It is just an ordinary story about a girl who is on the wrong path, and is forced to meet a good guy. But this good guy is not an ordinary guy, he is a man like no other. The characters are great, and the story is not too complicated. The only problem I had with it was that it did not keep up with the storyline so it became very dull. However, all that could be forgiven because this is really a good and imaginative movie.

It's not very complicated to get to the ending but, once there it's good stuff.  However, it does have its problems.  Firstly, they used a lot of flashbacks.  The flashbacks don't really help. The movie was actually really good without it.  I felt like the movie was missing some material.  If you like a movie, that is good and does a lot, and it also has a lot to say, then watch this movie.

It has plenty of jokes in it, it's all very childish, and they laugh and play all day. All the characters in this movie are a little different from one another. Most of them are more like cartoon characters, and there is no true villain in the film. The characters are all good, though, and even the bad ones are good.

There was one scene that really got me excited, that was when the mom told the kids that they were going out on a cruise,   and that was a great part.  It showed how they grew up and how they felt about leaving home.  My favorite scenes were the one where the boys were talking to the mother and she was giving them a "dab"  and then they asked what they should do to go out on the cruise, they could go to the top of the tallest building,  then the mom pointed to the beach and they both said that they would go out there if they did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original book, by John D. MacDonald, was a classic of "dark fantasy," written in the early 1950s, and it is just as relevant as ever. And if you like this kind of fantasy, you should be well aware of the "new" dark fantasy in the vein of Lord of the Rings. The book has been updated to add new elements: now there are demons in an alternate universe, they are evil and do evil things, and there are more than a few humans living there, as well. I like this sort of material: not as much action and romance as some contemporary fantasy, but certainly an interesting blend of fantasy and history, which I enjoy. The main character, the sorcerer D'Arcee, comes from a distant past in the history of a small island, a past which she has never visited, but which is described by the old wizard of her family, who is a sort of guide to her. The wizards and sorcerers and druids of the world live a sort which is not too distant from the medieval European tradition of magic, and they have a sort-of hierarchy, with each spell being cast by a certain level of wizard, and with a certain number of druids and wizards, and a certain type of magic. The sorcerers of the island, who live in a sort like a fairy kingdom, are the leaders of this society, and their goal is to preserve the old ways of their magic. This society has a sort feudal system: if a magician or sorcerer dies, he or she will be buried on a special spot of the land, and if a sorceress is killed, she will also be buried there. In this society the sorcerers have a great degree of power: they can make any wish, and the people will obey them. But there is a great deal of corruption in this society: the sorceresses are greedy and power-hungry, and many of the men and women are slaves to them, and all the children are forced to live in this kind "school" (in this sense, the society is much like the medieval aristocracy, but even more so), where they learn magic and learn how to use it. There are wizards, who specialize in casting spells, and sorceresses who perform magic, but there are also druids, who are very powerful, and are in fact quite a threat to the entire world, since they are so powerful, that a powerful war could destroy this world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the opening credit song played, a woman's voice over a TV screen warned that a "special guest is on her way," and that "I can't wait to show you what she's made of." As we watched, two women went into a small room and made love: the woman in the yellow dress was the woman we've seen on the TV screen, the blonde-haired woman was a man, and a woman with a black leather jacket and big blue eyes was the black leather-jacketed woman. When the woman with the black jacket and blue eyes left, we saw a black-clad woman, but she turned out to be a young man who was still a virgin. This was the beginning of a movie that is as sexy and sexy as a movie can be, as if it were written by a woman. It is sexy in the best sense of the word: it has a good sense of humor and has a great sense of sex. It has a sexy sense of mystery and eroticism. In a sense, this is one of those movies you have to see to believe. The movie is a combination of porno (like the kind in porn movies) and sex (like a lot of pornos of the time). But it's so much more than that. If you haven't seen it, you have the best of both worlds.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My brother and I both went to this movie, and we loved it. My brother came from the same small town in Kentucky that the movie is set in. He is probably one of the first to be drafted into the army in his country. He meets a girl named Carrie when he and some other boys run into a band of thieves and he and the girl are sent to the town to stop them. The band is composed of a girl who likes to drink and a little brother that is a little too much like his father. The other boys are all a little jealous and try to take advantage of the girl. But Carrie is kind to everyone, especially her father. She is a great mother, but she has her own problems to take care of. But she does and will make the best out of every situation she finds herself in. I really liked this movie. There was a good mixture of romance, and action. The story never got boring, and the ending was very good. The movie got a "R" rating from me, because I did find one thing that could have been changed. It is not so bad, but I think it could have used a little more nudity. I know that some people find nudity offensive, but when it is done right, it makes you feel good. But I just didn't think that a little skin could do the film any good.   "R" rated The movie "R' rated is a dark comedy about the love triangle between a little old lady, her sister and her best friend. It follows the girls and the gang as they are in high school trying to avoid getting expelled. They play a game called "Rock Bottom", a drinking game where they drink as much as they can while falling down. Carrie is the oldest and is the only female to have been "rock bottom". Her father is an alcoholic and her mother seems to be unable to raise a child. The first man she meets is a high school nerd who she falls in love with. There is a lot of drinking and flirting as the gang tries to keep from getting expelled, until Carrie has enough. Carrie decides to leave the gang and get a job in a department store, but soon her brother and father come to town, telling her that she will get fired if she stays. They all live together until they are sent on a quest to recover the stolen money and their friend in the band.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is very similar to The Devil and the Angels.   First of all, The Devil & the Angels is a remake of the 1959 film, The Evil Eye, which was made during the witch hunt of the Salem witch trials.  What's interesting about The Evil Heart is that it was made in 1969.    I am guessing that there were some changes in the screenplay for this remake and the same actors were used in both versions, because it looks identical.  My favorite thing about this film is that its not a remake, its a remake with a new twist on a story that dates back to the early 1800's.  The movie is a thriller.  It opens with a woman being chased by a vampire, and I thought that was a pretty effective opening.  However, the twist comes at the end of the movie, and the audience is left in total disbelief as to what is really going on.  There is a reason that this film was remade in 1969, because the script was so old.  Like in The Devil And The Angels, the heroine is an artist, and her lover is a poet.  Here, the protagonist is the same, but the story is a very different one.  Although the hero is an interesting figure, he is not the hero of the story, the love interest is.  When he is caught, the female lead takes his innocence, which we know she has.  I do not want to over stress the fact that it is a love story, but I think that's a major theme in this story.  After the protagonist and love interest kiss, they realize they can't love each other and they decide to go on an epic journey of love and passion that takes them all over the world.  So, in conclusion, this is a classic love story with lots of action and heart, but not a very good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so happy I got to see this! My favorite of the trilogy, and a wonderful comedy. A fantastic story.

And the woman was a man, so they had to do a dance on the rooftop, and the man got up to the top of the building, and I was there. I mean I was like five years old. I was in high school and I remember it very vividly. I can still see those trees in the background, and there's the woman on the ground. Then the man stands up, and she's like, 'Hey, I'm an alien, and this is a dream.' And the man says, 'This is real. And you know what that means, right?' And the girl looks at him with all these big blue eyes and she says, and he says, yeah, I know it means we're in love.' "  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people were disappointed by the second film in the Hunger Games series (the second, in fact). The first film had been very successful for the director (Districts was an instant classic and would win two Oscars). However, there were some pretty big issues in the movie.   I liked the first Hunger Games (but I think that the first movie was a little more out there in terms of its content than the second one was).   One of the biggest complaints I had was the lack of Katniss Everdeen in the film.  As a little girl, Katn a great girl and she does really good at the games.  She is kind of a tomboy but her sister has a more of a'manly' look about her and she can't keep her sister from taking part in the games in order to get in better with Peeta. She is constantly pining for him and he knows about it.  Katnisse makes the list of the hottest girls in the world of the games and even though she was a virgin when the games begin, she does a great job of hiding it and doesn't want to get her panties wet or risk her virginity.  While it wasn't completely convincing, I liked Katnens attitude and attitude toward the games because she doesn't let anyone take advantage of her.  It was kind of like a Disney movie.     The sequel, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, seems to be more of the same.  In the first film, it looked like a fantasy world but I don't think they actually created a very realistic world at all.  When the film started, I was expecting something like a sequel to The Lion King.  The first movie had a strong connection to its predecessor as both were about young boys who have dreams and dreams come true. This sequel has similar themes as The Lion king except that, like the original film, all the boys are orphans who are basically forced to fight in a very serious way for the glory of the 'Queen.'   For the people who thought that they were going to see a realistic story, they were disappointed.  I thought the first films were much better than this.  For a young girl who has a lot of pressure on her, Kat will always find a way to have fun. I really liked that she is in a relationship with Peetas brother.  I think her character was great.  Even though

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited to see this movie.     I had seen the trailer before the movie, and even though I had my doubts, I was interested in seeing a sequel to The Great Mouse Detective.  My concerns were alleviated as the movie didn't disappoint.  When I saw the poster for this movie, I thought that it looked like a kid's movie. I couldn't imagine a movie that would have the "mouse" in the title.  It wasn't until I saw a trailer that I was disappointed. I don't think that a little boy or girl would enjoy this movie very much.  The plot is too predictable, and it's hard to understand much of what's going on.  I feel that the director, Tim Burton, should have used a good story, and I think he's not a great director.  This movie just doesn't do much for me.  There were two characters that I really cared about.  They were both voiced by the same actor, but I think that they should have tried to be more than just a couple of characters.  But it doesn't matter because the other characters were all forgettable.  One thing that I thought was really annoying was the fact that the film was going to be in color, but it just wasn't.  As for the special effects, they were really good.  While the movie is supposed to be a sequel, it was really kind of rushed.  Some of the special effect work seemed a little too amateurish, as well as the effects.  Also, the songs were kind of forgettable, although I'm not sure if it was just me. I think the characters were a little to much.     Summary:  I liked the movie!  There wasn't much to this movie that made me cry.

And I was right about it getting on my  I don't care what anyone else thinks about this movie. I don a sense that it's been tried before. I see so many different types of movies in the theaters these days, but not too many that I think really work. This one does. And that's what makes it work.   So you are a small, sad-looking, homeless boy who is in a park with some people and they are talking about how much fun they had. So one of the boys decides to take a ride with him; and off they go. Now that you know how I feel about it, you can understand why I'm thinking, "I'm really going to have fun!" That's one of those little stories that I love to read.   the story is told in three parts, each part dealing with a different character who has to cope with the situation they are in. I liked how the story was told through different characters, rather than in a straight forward manner. I'd read a book like this before and I would have liked to see what the author had done with each of the characters; so this was interesting to me. In a way I like it, because it has some different things in it; but it does seem like this was written to appeal to the small children. It was a fun story that I enjoyed. I didn't find the ending all that satisfying, but I guess this is a child's movie; it isn't about how it's going to be for a grown-up. I suppose it would be very entertaining to see how the characters do in a few more years; if they haven't gotten into drugs by then.    And it is just as you say it will be!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In some ways, I'm a big fan of "The Room". It is one of the most clever, satirical, cleverly written, brilliantly directed, funny, and incredibly well acted comedy films I've ever seen. It is hilarious, absurd, and full of brilliant one-liners. It has a wonderfully complex, disturbing theme and it is never quite as simple as its premise would suggest. But I wouldn't say it's necessarily a good film for all ages.   "The Disaster Artist" might not be a great film for adults. It's not a great comedy for kids, either.  But for those who are not overly sensitive, perhaps those who like a little bit of darkness and absurdity, "The Dinner Party" is a very rewarding experience.

If you are looking for a movie about a man, a girl and a world to create in this post apocalyptic world, I can't recommend it enough!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... It is a real eye opener.. - I am a believer in the power of prayer.   And prayer is not the only way to get your problems solved - and the people at Biltmore are doing a wonderful job of helping their guests.  And I just can't stop laughing.  But as they say, it is a short trip to heaven - and a short time at that.  I'd say it's worth a try - and I sure am enjoying myself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is about a young boy who is trapped in a box with a monster. The plot is simple: boy is locked in a cardboard box with monster (there are many, many cardboard boxes with monsters), boy has no idea what to do, boy meets a girl who has a cat and a boy who has an umbrella. The girl is the key to the puzzle. The monster is the only thing that keeps boy alive. The story takes place in a town where people want to go to heaven but their fathers want to take them to hell, where there's a lake and all the dead and the monster can't kill the boy. There's a lot of tension in the movie, but I think it's well-done. I don't like horror movies, so this will probably not be a good one, but it's a movie that does the right things well. It's a nice movie to look at, and it's interesting to watch. The music is also cool. The ending of the movie makes a lot more sense than it should.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. This movie is about a group of men who go to a party with their friend, a guy named Jeff (I didn't like Jeff), and a girl named Michelle. When Jeff and Michelle leave the party, they meet a couple that has taken a bus to their destination (their friend has bought tickets for them). Jeff and the girl take a ride in the bus with the guy and the couple, while Michelle gets in a cab. At the end of the movie, Michelle dies, and a couple of other people are killed, as well. This is a dark, depressing movie. There are plenty of things that don't make sense, as the bus driver and the guy with Michelle seem to have a thing for each other. There is also a couple (I believe it was Scott and Mary Jo) who are not who they seem to be, and it turns out that Scott and Michelle have a secret about Jeff and they are in love. The movie also has a lot of sexual innuendos, and the movie gets very intense at times. It makes me feel very uncomfortable as I think about this movie, and this would be a good place to stop. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't think I've ever seen a film in which every scene is filled with a mixture of emotion and comedy that would really be impossible to follow without some help from a dictionary. This film may well have made the audience forget everything they ever knew about comedy and love.   The comedy here is so subtle and well done that it actually feels like you've been told a story while sitting next to a stranger at a local diner.  What is there to say about the film?   "The King in Yellow" may well prove to be an instant classic, which would have a major impact on the way we think about the art of film.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character's dad is a "jock" as the kids say. His mom's parents were also "jocks," in the sense that she's a good athlete and he's a great swimmer. But his mom's mom is much more athletic and a bit more intelligent than her daughter and the fact that she went to the college of her choice and not his meant she could get a lot more athletic scholarships (in fact a big reason why his dad left was because she got a scholarship at an Ivy League school and she didn't get to attend that school). But that's not the main part of this movie. The main part is that the dad had an affair with her sister's girlfriend and they have two kids together. But it's not too complicated a situation, and if you're a family drama it might not be that complicated. But for me it wasn't very interesting to watch and I didn't care very much about the two kids. There are a lot of good characters and good scenes, but it just didn't mean a lot to me and I'd recommend you to skip this one if you haven't seen the other two films.

It was not a very exciting movie and I would have liked to see a little more action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the first movie I've seen from Rian Johnson, who was once the writer/director for Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back and Star Trek, among other film roles.   I like his movies a lot.  He is well put together, well acted, and clearly has a lot of talent.  However, this film is not as good as Star Trek: Into Darkness.  The movie starts out slow and then picks up really fast.  One might say that the film takes itself a little too seriously.  Unfortunately, this is something I am all too familiar with.  To me, this movie is not just bad, it is very, very, VERY, very bad.  For starters, the film feels almost like a parody of the Star Trek series.  Yes, it has the humor, the wit, and the sense of adventure, but it is really just like an "educational science fiction" film about aliens.  In fact, the title of the film is "The Making of 'The Other Side of Heaven'"  And this is the main character's name?  Yes.  A person named "Zachary Quinto."  And that is his main motivation?  Well, he doesn't know that his wife, Susan Quinto (Nicole Kidman), is in fact a alien.  They are not exactly sure of the reason why she is not human, and they have a couple of theories.  Zachary believes that his mother was abducted by an alien ship and his father was involved in some sort of a cover-up to keep his wife's identity a secret.  This leads him to have a lot more anger than he should have, and this becomes evident very quickly.  Meanwhile, Susan is a real human being.  She has a human family, and she is a loving and kind woman who just wants to be accepted by her husband.  All of these things make her a great hero for Zachary.  Susan is the real star of the movie, though.  While Zachary is trying to come to terms with his new found life with his wife and a new alien friend, Susan comes across this "other side of heaven" that is home to people who are genetically engineered for various things.  And it seems that everyone that is born into this other side of heavens is going to die.  It makes sense that these people are destined to die, because otherwise, there wouldn't
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is the true story of the final battle of the Great Depression in the American West. It is a movie about how greed gets in the way of progress, but most importantly it is about a friendship that is forged in the cold, bitter days of the Depression.   The story is set in California. After the depression broke, the Great West was left with just a few hundred small farms and towns. The area was populated by nomadic Indians who lived off the land. It was at this time that a small group of American veterans decided to make a living on the open range by fighting the Indian nomads. The veterans were a bit tough. They were big and strong, and when they went into battle they had the muscle and equipment to last until dawn. They worked together as a group to kill the Indians.  One of the veterans was a rough-looking man. He was also a good shot and a brave leader. His name was George Miller. He had a rough face and wore rough clothes. He often smoked a pipe with the soldiers.  The rest of the group were from Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma. They had a strong sense of honor and a burning desire to win.  When the Americans went into the Indian country they met some of the worst the Indians had to offer. They faced some of history's most ferocious warriors. A great amount of bloodshed was on the cards. The Americans were forced to fight with small bands of the warriors. They eventually took them out and forced the Indians to turn on each other. It went on for days. The American soldiers were the last to surrender. One of them was George Smith. He never got to finish off the last enemy warrior and the other Americans just left him there to die.  After a while the Indians found that they were the ones who had really won this war. They grew strong, their people grew rich, and the American soldiers who had fought their way to a victory became the hunted and hated savages of the West. The Indians and the Americans were now two different peoples. They would never again be allies.  For this reason the American army called for an end to the Great War. The war ended on December 10, 1932. The end of the war was accompanied by the end of American involvement in the Western frontier.  Because of this there are no Western movies today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at a midnight showing. I went to see it with my sister who I love to go see movies with. As we got into the movie, I thought it was really funny. I mean I really did. The funny parts, the characters were all so good. It was just so funny. Then we got to the part where they were about to blow up the school. The explosions were all done well. Then there was this crazy guy who is a fireman. He was really crazy, but he was funny. The characters, and even the things they did were funny. It really brought out the best in them. There was so much action, and I really loved how well it was done. I even laughed during one of the funnier parts. I would definitely go to this movie again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing you'll notice is the cinematography; the picture is very pleasing to the eye, and the music is wonderful as well.   Then, we get to the part where they get to "the mountain", which is a bit of a disappointment, because of how much you're told you'll be going up and down it.  The movie is a little confusing, but the actors are all great.  But the climax is just awesome; so good!   "The Mountain" is an experience, and should be seen by anyone, and anyone who enjoys good science fiction movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is a really good thriller. It's not a film that's meant to shock the audience in any way (at all). I think it's a really simple movie. It tells the story of a woman who is attacked by a woman and a guy and then tries to escape. But that's really all it does. I'm glad I gave it a shot. It was a really unique, creepy and entertaining film that I would recommend.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I just got a little tipsy when I heard that 'The Hateful Eight' is coming to a theater near me. When I first heard about it I didn't want to go because I couldn't decide whether it was the most enjoyable and exciting film of the year or the worst. Then I saw the trailer and I was blown away. It's bloody, gory, bloody, bloody."   I didn�t think I was going to like The Hateful Five, a movie that seems to be about the last five years of my life. I'm sure that's one of the reasons I liked the movie so much: the way it was shot and edited, the tension of it. The characters were interesting, and I couldn�t stop laughing. The story is a story of revenge, and the characters are a bunch of hicks who find themselves caught up in a deadly game of chance. I thought the actors were good, especially the actors who played the bad guys. It seemed that the script and the acting were really done by people who really cared.   The story of The H in Five (not a title, but a tag) is a revenge movie: in five towns on the Great Plains of America, the townspeople have been having their throats cut by men who have been drinking the town�s blood. When the town leader kills a man, a couple of the townsfolk kill him too. The townsfolk are a tribe of hick cowboys, cowards who fear nothing in the world except a white man and his horses. As the men kill more and more of the hick guys, they are being threatened by the hicks� women: all the townswomen, they have been taken over by the devil. This all leads to a final showdown: the hicking townsfolk have been promised that if they kill their wives, the devil�s wife will return to them. The hicks have to find some way to kill their husbands, so they decide to drink their wives� blood. The film does not have much plot. Just a bunch, a lot of people who are on a road to revenge, but never the plot gets in the way of the humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In an interview about the making of the film, the director said that a good film is about a man who is caught in a bad mood.   The film is all about the bad mood and what is bad mood about?   A man (Mr. O) is going around the streets of the city on the daily looking for someone to steal from.  A car and some other bad stuff get involved in the crime and he ends up in a big fight between the car and the bad guys.  The ending is not really very good, but it is a good way to end the movie.  Some interesting scenes are there but they are not that good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The one thing you can say about the movie is that you shouldn't be surprised how much of a talented actor is given by the director to play the part of the protagonist. A little overblown at times and a little too long at some points, but he makes the role his own and is perfectly suited for it. The movie is funny at times, but also heart-breaking at times. It is a story about an orphaned boy who is forced to live with a grandmother and a aunt while growing up. In order to survive the tough life of poverty, the orphan learns that he has to be smart, crafty, and resilient. And that he will have to outwit his way to happiness, or to survive. This is a good, hard-working movie that will keep you smiling and wanting to go out and see a movie like it. It has some good laughs and it is certainly worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I were recently having a wonderful time in Mexico City. One afternoon, we happened upon a very interesting place: an old house, and a house that seemed to be built by an artist of some renown. It has been here for a very long time. I was immediately attracted by the beautiful stone carving of a woman who was seated on a pedestal. It was one of those moments in a great city when you just look up and realize that there are so many things to look at and admire in a city as great as that. We then took our seats in the back of the house. I don't remember how long we sat there and what we did, but my husband had an excellent time. We had a terrific evening. The next morning we decided to stay at the hotel where the old house was located, and while enjoying our evening in the room, we heard a commotion outside. It sounded like an emergency room. I went outside and saw a policeman standing by a car, with his arm around the driver's side door, the door to the car open, the car slowly turning into the front yard of a house which was now in flames. He was carrying a large piece of redwood lumber. I saw no one in the house, but I immediately recognized the man in the firefighting outfit as Dr. Robert C. Anderson, who had been my dentist in St. Louis. We sat around the fire for a few moments, and when I asked him what he wanted, he told me that his wife was dead. He said that he had been going out every evening at about half past seven until about ten when the fire started in the old place. I thought it was odd that Dr. Anderson had gone out every night at about that hour, and I was puzzled over it, thinking of the fire department's usual hours and the old building's peculiar appearance and character. I said to him, "Well, Dr. Bob, what was your practice like?" He replied, "My practice was exactly like a normal one, except that on a certain day every day of the week I did dental work from nine to ten." I asked, "Why, what day is that? " He told me, "On Mondays, Tuesday, and Wednesdays. I had gone to bed about two o'clock in the morning. About ten o' clock that night I was awakened from a sound sleep. I got up and went outside. I heard the

It has the most realistic and realistic acting of any movie I have seen.  The movie did not have any big explosions.  My main complaint is that I thought it took a really long time to get into the movie. I think the movie should have been better told in the beginning of the movie when it was being written and not when it came out.  All in all, it was a great movie and a must watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Man from Earth" is a terrific sci-fi/horror film about a man with a brain tumour who tries to find his way back home to the Earth with help from a strange alien scientist. The alien, "Gladstone", (Richard Attenborough) seems to be a nice, harmless fellow, yet somehow, he gets the better of the man.  It's a brilliant mixture of comedy, adventure, mystery, horror and sci- fi. It's definitely a horror film and I'm surprised nobody's made a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film follows a group of children who discover that their mother has a secret.   She had lived with an older woman for some time before she married a young married man. He was older and more experienced with women and he was going to teach her some things about life. However, before he started teaching her these things, he had an affair with a woman who is his age.  The children were taught a lot about sex and how to use sex to help them in some situations.  These young married men were also taught about different forms of sex.  In the first part of the film, the children had some fun while playing games.  There was also some time when they all decided to eat in the family kitchen.  They went through a series of sexual activities until the day that mother discovered that she had an infidelity.  A big fight broke out between the family, with all of them being in favor of one of them divorcing his wife.  However, one of the children has a good heart, and he has decided that he will marry her.  When they get married, they start to have sex, and then have sex again when they are having sex together.  After each sex act, the wife tells her husband what happened.  She then tells him to come home and take a good look at his wife because she is cheating.  At the end of the day, both the husbands are divorced from their wives.  All of them then go to different places.  I don't think that this film would have worked any better if the actors were much younger.  Each actor was a little bit different from the next one and they all sounded a little different from each other.  This movie wasn't very good, but it was interesting and fun to watch.  Recommended for those who have a good sense of humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that this is one of those movies that has a lot of good, but no great, ideas.   The plot is fairly simple.  A young girl is sent by her father to a school that teaches her how to play the piano and how to make the prettiest, sweetest music she can.  This is the same teacher who sent her daughter to that place where she became a slave to the piano.  Her daughter soon is forced to go back to her father and learn all about slavery and sexual bondage.  I really liked this movie.  There is a lot to like about it.  It's not too fast paced, but it doesn't need to be, it has enough good ideas for a good film to be interesting.  The sex scenes are pretty well done and the acting is pretty good.  After seeing this I was left with some pretty big wet dreams.  Not a fan of the music that is used in the movie, but other than that I really enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't have a lot of patience for movies that start off slow and end abruptly.   For the first 20 minutes I thought "This is going to be a slow movie." Then the movie got started.  The main character is a doctor who, at a certain age, becomes fascinated with death.  For a medical movie, the plot was solid.  It was like a movie about a doctor and a family member who spend time together.  I found it very interesting that a medical doctor, as well as a family that loved and respected him, were affected by his illness.  There were a lot about the characters that I don´t like.  One of the main characters, the father, is an alcoholic and doesn´t know how to deal with his daughter, the mother. He never learns how to love or even care for her, and always blames her for his alcoholism.  In a movie that is really about a character's personal growth, I feel a lot more sympathy for the character than for his family.  That is why I don' t like the movie as a whole.  If you like a slow-paced movie and really don´ t care about who is right or wrong,  this is a good one.  This film got a good rating from me because it is a slow moving story about a personal story about loss and grief and about the way a person can learn to be happy in spite of everything.  A great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all,   I think this is a really great movie that was made with a great crew and in a few short months it was accepted at the "Omaha International Film Festival" as the best "cinema" film of the year.   This is a real "film noir" movie that is the perfect balance of romance and drama.  The story is really fast paced and keeps you guessing as to how the relationship between the two leads will be.  One thing that I noticed is that   the main character is actually more of a "villain" in the movie, but   you won't be able to take him too seriously as he is still a hero to many in the film.  Also the music is great and the film is so beautiful, I recommend to anyone who is into "cine"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am still trying to find the exact movie  .. I was hooked from the first scene, which I saw when I was in the US, and I wanted to see the rest.   "   The story follows a group of students from a high school in Boston that were planning to run away to Canada.  The teacher, who was going to meet a girl there, found them.  "Innocence is a strong word, don't worry about it", says a policeman, who is the one who first finds them.  "They're not just teenagers, they're little monsters," says the girl. "They can talk," says her friend.  'They can think", says another.  But the real monster comes in the form of a demon with a burning soul.  A demon is a soul that is angry, sad and evil.  The only way it can express itself is by burning people up to a point where they can't be revived.  In this way, it doesn't kill you and the fire only serves as a signal that the soul has escaped from its body.  There is some talk about the evils of society, about the dangers of youth.  And finally they are all captured by a local priest.  After some time, they get back on their feet.  To a child it can seem impossible to escape the demon, but the teacher comes up with a plan, and together they run away.  One night, after they all run away, they all find out that there is a town with no roads, no trees, no cars, no houses, just a single light.  They all decide to get a map of the town and try to reach the light. "We can't see the light, we'll never get there," says a boy.  When the girl tries to find out what the light is, she is trapped in the town.  As the story proceeds, a lot of people die and get reborn.  This is not a very happy ending, and it doesn' look like the rest of the movie will be much better.  Still, I enjoyed the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was extremely impressed with the movie, it was an interesting film that was quite different from most of the things I had seen in a movie theater. The movie is about a man named Raylan Givens who finds himself at the center of the biggest crime in his hometown. The film did a good job at establishing what the town of Glenwood is like, I feel like a person who has lived there his whole life and has always been friendly with everyone, but that is about to change when a serial killer is on the loose and the whole town is on edge. The town is a nice little story that really got to me, the cast really got the job done and I could not put it down.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie: A group of guys who work at a pizza place are having a good time. They're all pretty drunk but they're having a great time together. The one guy, a hot blonde, is really good looking, funny, and horny. He can get his girl all worked up without even leaving the pizza parlor. The other guys are really good to him too. All they need is a good blow job and a good ride. The whole time they're all in the van together. A few guys talk about sex, and how it can be fun. The guys all seem to like their girl, but they are getting bored, and they want to get out of the van. Their girl doesn't seem interested in this and neither are the guys. The girl is getting bored too. It's getting close to the night and the guys think it's a good idea to go down the hill to the house next door. They'll stay up a bit, and then they'll walk down the road. They are really horny, so they all head down the walk to the next house. They've already made a couple of bets, and the bets are that the girl will get knocked up. Then they'll get rid of her, or something will happen to her. They think she's probably pregnant. One guy is about to call her out on it, but his friend tells him that she's really beautiful, and that his girlfriend is getting him excited. It is one of the best movie scenes I have seen in years.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie really is a great movie about how to survive a zombie apocalypse. A good movie for those who are bored or don't like the kind of movies they see on the screen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure I'm not the only one that is a little tired of the recent trend of "the same old, same old", but this one was a refreshing change. Sure, it may be somewhat predictable, and yes, there were a few repetitions, but the twists never failed to keep you on the edge of your seat.   The director (Ritchie) is the same one behind The Rock, and I do mean same, but this time he was able to do things a little bit differently.  This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while, and an essential watch for any horror movie fan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As for what it is: This movie is about a group of friends that are living with their father, an old man who has gone blind. They have an old TV in the living room and this one shows a show called "A Christmas Story" which is about Christmas Eve. The friend in question, John (Jeff Goldblum) who is the least religious person is able to find a quiet place to sit by himself. This is about as boring as it gets. When he is alone by himself he starts to have his own thoughts and the movie starts to pick up. When they get to the "Christmas Story" the next morning he hears the mother (who I don't remember) screaming. That is when he decides to go on the run with his friend Jim (David Arquette). There is a scene at a train station where they meet some strangers (which is good but is it an original idea to introduce a woman who looks like a bird and a man who doesn't seem to be much of a person). But after that, you will be able to think of nothing but John and Jim and how they get out of this situation.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't have any expectations going in, and I was pleasantly surprised. My brother really enjoyed it, and he doesn't like action movies much. He didn't care about any plot or dialogue, and that is what makes this movie so fun to watch. The fact that this movie is only 7 minutes long was enough for me to enjoy the whole movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am an old school fan of the old-time radio show The Blue Collar Show, and the new version that is on in the evening is the best Blue Coller show that I have ever heard. It is not just the songs that are really good, but the performances of the players are wonderful. This is one of the better musicals I have heard from the old timers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a very big fan of movies. I even have my very own Blu-ray Disc collection of many of these movies. Recently, I came across the movie "My Favorite Murder" on a DVD I bought in the past. It was a pretty standard slasher movie and not so memorable, but it was my favorite one! It was directed by Peter Cushing and was also directed by a very good guy, Jack Clayton! If you like the genre, I recommend this film to you. And it is still available on a digital copy on Netflix. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most interesting character in the movie is a man who is a drug addict. The main point of the movie was to show that drug addiction is a disease and a bad one. The movie itself is about drug addiction and how it destroys the lives of those affected.   The main character is an actor who does the job of a drug-addict.  He has a lot of sex with all the women he meets and then sleeps with their husbands.  I like it.  One of the scenes of the film was so funny I don't know where I'm going with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good thriller, and an excellent detective tale.   A good story that has been told well.  (review of free book)  In a New York City hospital, where a young man, suffering from schizophrenia, is being treated by the psychiatrist and his orderly, Mrs. Ovens and her assistant, the psychiatrist's wife.   The patient is so insane that he can no longer distinguish between the two persons. The orderly, Ms. O'Donnell, who has a close friendship with the psychiatrist, begins to notice some of the oddities and peculiarities that the patient is beginning to exhibit.   Ms.O'Donnell tries to comfort the patient, but to no avail.   Eventually, the patient begins to scream, and the nurse has to break down a door.      "It was a horrible sight. In fact, it was as if someone had pulled a knife on a child, as if he had been put to bed with a bucket of water thrown over him and then thrown into the shower. The water poured in like a flood in a heavy rain and the scream was a shrill hiss. But the scream could not be heard through the wall because of the walls of the shower."    The Nurse:  I remember the nurse was a lovely person. Her hair was all red with sweat, her eyes were red as blood, she was a great physical specimen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as I am concerned this is the best movie I have seen in a long time. I love the story line, the characters, and the dialogue. It is well made, entertaining and a great action movie to have with a nice amount of action and a nice ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is based on the famous "A" story. It has been made in the form of an animation, and is a good way of seeing it. The movie shows how a good detective like Sartin (played by the late James Coburn) solves crimes, and with the help of his friends. This movie is entertaining, it is well directed and composed, and it has some good stories, such as the one about a man who buys a beautiful but dangerous and dangerous to be taken on the road "Witch", the police who are hunting the man who bought the car and his friends who are trying to find it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I were just thinking about it this evening. It was pretty damn good! It is good, but not great. I don't think it is any of the best of all the B movies from B horror flicks. I think it has some good ideas, but the writing is a little cliche. It seems a little like the kind of movie that will probably be on the shelves of the library, when it is finally a year old or so.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband said this movie was the most original film of the year. It was so good that he couldn't even figure out why we were watching it again. That was a lot of fun. The characters are all very good. Some characters seem a little too real in this movie. However, the film is very good so I was still very entertained.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking for something new and cool and when I stumbled upon this movie, I was in. It's a sci-fi thriller about a scientist who finds himself being targeted by an old friend who was part of an ancient conspiracy and is after the truth about an intergalactic war, or perhaps it is just the perfect metaphor for the human condition.   He finds out that his friend was part an ancient human race who was trying to prevent them from getting home, but they were killed off by a rogue alien species that is attacking their planet, so they were trapped in the stars for millions of years, which meant that even though we've learned so much about our solar system, the whole history of humanity is just one vast story in a universe of stars and planets.  And then the aliens come to visit them and take them back to the stars so that they can create a new species. This is the story that is the most interesting, as the main character learns the truth.  When you start a movie like this, the film is a little slow. I found it too slow. The film doesn't try to reinvent the wheel and does try to tell a good story, but it doesn't manage to find the emotional core, but then again, in a genre of horror, that's not too surprising.  It also feels a little too dated.  There's not much originality or creativity in the writing, the characters are one dimensional and the actors are really wooden, but the special effects are really good, even if they are not that good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So many reviews here are about how bad and offensive it is, but I must say that the only thing I didn't like about this film is the use of the word 'nigger' (which is used with a lot of disdain and anger), but that's not what it's about, it's a very interesting story with a twist, and I will say it's one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never knew about The Big Green Screen until I was offered the chance to attend a screening at the new BGM in Portland, Oregon. When I arrived at the theater and found a nice selection of film noir and westerns, I was shocked by how dark they were. The color is washed out, and there's so much white space on the screen. The sound is just as bad. It was like listening to a recording. The only bright spot was the performances and the director's style. I thought it was great that a woman was behind the camera, and that he shot her with a long lens. It's a nice touch.   The Big Lense in Portland:  This film is a little like an old-timey Hollywood comedy, but with a modern, futuristic twist. A man, William J. Bennett, who lives in a big house, is an old fashioned man who doesn't like change, so he sets about renovating it. William can't find anyone to decorate it with modern gadgets and appliances. So he does it himself, with what he calls his "Big Lense." After being bored with the old house, he hires a woman, Dorothy, who does his painting for a couple of bucks a night. He then decides to move in and buy a house. However, all the other houses in town are a million dollars. This one is a million bucks as well, but it has one major problem: It's huge. When he goes up to buy it, a young woman, Rose, runs up and asks him for a dance. He says that she needs money, so she goes up and pulls out a small pistol that's in her purse. He tries to tell her not to do it, but she fires it at him. He falls down and she flees, but he gets up, pulls a gun from a safe, and follows. She tries to get away, and she runs into a wall, but this time she runs it into the wall, so that she falls down a hill and into the lake. He follows her and sees that the lake is filled with people who were caught in the lake, and he gets her out and they run down the hill. They are then pursued by a pack of dogs. They make it to the end of the hill and then run to the top and the dogs follow them. On top of the hills, William tells Dorothy that they are going to have a big party to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You are going to laugh out loud at this movie.   The movie takes place in the year 2039, and it is the year when the technology that allowed the human mind to fully enter the world of computers, telepathy and time travel are being developed.  One of the characters (Michael) is sent back in time to the year 1930 in a time capsule.  He then travels through time to meet his daughter, but is surprised when his future self tells him that his daughter was already born.  The whole movie takes itself very seriously, especially since it is a time travel movie. It is very much a sci-fi movie, not a comedy.  This movie is an excellent movie to watch at 3 AM.  My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie starts like a bad film does, where everything is going fine for the most part. Except for the first ten minutes when the bad guys are torturing a woman, which makes the film very creepy and it's hard to watch. I was expecting more from this movie, and I'm glad it's over. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .. . This is the story about a guy named Bumpy Johnson (played by Don Johnson) who works at a truck stop in a small town. When his boss starts to leave town for the winter, Bumpy goes to the local bar and falls in love with a pretty bartender named Cindy (played with amazing charm by Joan Allen). They decide to get married so she can come live in their house when he has a promotion. However, a few months later, Bumpy has a change of heart and decides to stay in the big city to find his lost love. In the meantime, he is dealing with a couple of disgruntled truckers who are looking for a way to get back to the big cities. Bumpy is still trying to find Cindy.   What a movie this is. I found it very romantic, romantic at times, and really made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised to see how good a movie I could make with a limited budget, no special effects and a group of actors who have a lot of experience in comedies and action/sci-fi shows. I feel that the director did not make this as a typical Western but as a fun action movie, so it should be a funny movie, but not a dull one. If you want to see a good comedy movie, get it.

This film takes you through a world of darkness where only one person can save you from the dark and the terrible creatures of this world. I didn't have to think much about how it was put together. The music was catchy enough, but it also worked to show the emotion of the characters. I had fun, but I wouldn't hesitate to take my kids and enjoy a good horror film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really well done. It is a movie about the lives of two men, Bob (John Candy) and Joe (John Malkovich) as they become involved in a series of small-town murders and murders of women. The stories are all real-life, and the characters are all well-rounded. This movie doesn't really have many memorable moments, but there are a number of them that really work. The acting is really top-notch, and I didn't like some of the lines, but the movie does have a lot of funny scenes and a lot to talk about. I think that this movie was well-done. It doesn't have many plot twists, but it does have plenty of laughs. This is a good "murder mystery" movie that is a lot better than the remake, and it is even better than most other movies like this that I have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say about the movie? It has a lot of action sequences, lots of action. The characters are all very funny and have a lot in common, which is a good thing. The action is done well and there is not much of it, but what is there is awesome and entertaining and I think it is something you should see if you have not seen the other 3 movies. There is a new villain in the movie but not a lot happens. I liked that this movie has a good twist at the end, it is a bit of a comedy and I can't wait to see the rest of this trilogy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, the film was called "A Quiet Place". It was a good film, but it wasn't bad.   This film was filmed in 1963. It was about a man and a woman.  This man lived in a quiet place with his wife. He didn't have a lot of friends. He did some work. And he liked his wife very much.  He had a job as a teacher and taught children. He liked his job and he had a good relationship with his daughter. But one day he felt a strange feeling about his wife and he came to know that his wife was cheating on him.  So he decided to get away from her.  But, what was that he came for?  A quiet place, a quiet life.  There was no drama in the film. It wasn't even good drama. It is a nice film and it is pretty good but it isn't a masterpiece.  The best part of the film is that there is a young man and girl who comes to this quiet place to live in peace. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a good one, and it is well produced, with a plot that is well thought-out, with interesting characters and good special effects. If you are a fan of science fiction, this movie is worth seeing. The special effects are also good, as well as the script. If there was anything that did not make this movie good, it was the acting. However, this is a special effects movie, not a good acting movie. I liked the director.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The worst of the best.   I was disappointed when I saw it, and now I've seen the sequels too and it has been worse than the first film.  Not really my scene though.  Very bad acting, bad comedy and bad acting again by the lead.  There were scenes that I thought would be hilarious (they are not) but they're not really funny.  I thought it was bad but it really isn't.  This is one of the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a must see for a great movie about two heroes who are out to solve a mystery of an old shipwreck. It is a classic tale about a daring crew to be sent to a secluded island to find a woman's body. It starts with a very intriguing and atmospheric music, where the island of mystery seems to be very real to the movie. The story is really good, and the characters are very interesting.   The plot is actually based on two books by C.S. Forester, the author is still alive and he is the one responsible for these novels.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film "A Touch of Sin" tells the story of a family in the late 1800s in a rural town. The father is a wealthy cotton farmer who has a son, a good-looking, athletic young man who is the center of the family. The son is given to a house mother named Edith who is a distant and cold mother. Edith and her husband are very strict to their daughter. This is in stark contrast to the father who is not a father, but a caring old man who loves his daughter. The children play together a lot and their father watches over them all the time. The film is told mostly in flashback and the film is set in a small town, so it is set during the mid to late 1800's.   After the children grow up and leave home, they are happy. They start a business. Soon the family is prosperous. Their success is due to the great work of the son and the children's skill in their craft.  The son and a family friend, who is also a cotton farmer, are both in love with a beautiful woman named Edie. The wife of the cotton farmer's father is the widow of a former slave named John. After a lifetime of suffering and abuse, John has finally made peace with his former slave. He has decided to marry Edie and the two are happy for awhile.  John does a good job as a house husband and Edie is a good daughter. It isn't long, though, before the women in the house start complaining. John does not want his daughter having a relationship with a white man. In the course of time, the house is overrun with angry women and they start to beat John and Edith up.  What is worse is that the father is unable to do anything to stop them and eventually decides to do something about it himself.  This is the father's son who decides to take things into his own hands. The woman he loves and loves him very much starts to hate him.  When the father leaves his home, the men of the town become angry and start to abuse him. When the men finally take him and his son to the county jail, the people of the village have a big celebration. The townspeople have been looking for a white husband for a long time.  After some time, John finally makes peace with John's former slave, John's wife, Edith, and their daughter, Edie, and they move out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is not a bad movie, its just a very, very bad movie with a lot of terrible acting and terrible, terrible story.   The most horrible and ridiculous thing about this movie is that it uses the whole audience of the movie to make the movie a better and a better experience by having it happen.  The whole movie is about the main character getting a girl to like him and in return the main guy likes the girl and becomes friends with her and later they get married.  It is a movie about two people who meet in the movie theater but only the guy's life changes because of the relationship he starts with the girl.  It does not make a whole lot of sense from start to finish.  So the guy has problems, he is a bit of a loser who is constantly rejected by girls, he gets married, but his wife gets drunk one night and has sex with her boyfriend and the girl ends up in the hospital.  This guy is supposed to be the main hero, but he has no friends, no girlfriend and nothing going on in his life except his job.  But what about the girl?  It turns out that her parents have died and her family is being a bit mean to her.  And so what happens?  The girl becomes a sex slave for the guy.  They live a pretty boring life.  These people do not want a relationship with a "stupid" guy, so they try to keep the guy as far away from them as possible, so that the girl has no one.  When the guy is at his wits end, he comes to the house of the girl, who has gone through some problems and has turned to drink.  Then we get a scene with the guy and the guy (who we thought was the main girl) are playing a game of rock paper scissors.  She wins and she runs to the door and the door shuts.  I'm not sure why this scene is in a movie called, "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."  They have to have a scene like this, because otherwise it would just be a boring movie.  Why does she run to the other side of the door?  We never know.  A scene later shows the two of them talking.  Ricky Bobby is on a date and he has invited the girl to the date too.  Well, in this movie, he has nothing to do and his life is

A strange planet, but a good one to visit.   The movie's got good acting, good story and good visuals. The story's pretty strange to begin with, but it gets better and better as the movie goes on...   I can recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about weird stuff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw the first trailer for "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" a few weeks ago, I knew I had to see this. My friend and I watched the entire movie with laughter and we were both amazed at how funny this film is and how funny it is at the same time. It is very funny and I enjoyed every minute of it. The acting is very strong in the movie and everyone's antics are hilarious. This was a fun movie to watch and it made my day when we finished it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this film 4 times. I am a big fan of John Waters. I love everything about this film. I hope this one does well.  The plot is interesting and funny. John Waters does a lot of things that seem to be "off". He is a writer but he is not funny. I liked this movie.  "I Am a Bad Girl." is the movie I watch when I have problems with girls. It is a story about a bad girl and her relationship with a good girl. This movie was not very funny but it was fun. I like this movie because it was funny and it wasn't too long. It had a very good plot and a good plot is the best thing a movie can have. I do have to say it was hard to get through it all. I got to about the third and fourth and the plot was getting a bit out of control. I would like to say that the plot would be better in a different director, but I could not bring myself to stop watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (I'm not sure if it's a good film or not, but I've seen a lot of films over the years and this is definitely one of my favorites. For starters, it's actually a nice story to be sure, but it also has the sort of style that I'd expect from a Hollywood movie. But, the main thing I love about this movie is that it's just so funny. There are some really good performances, but most of the comedy comes from one guy. That's not to say that everyone else doesn't do well, it just is really one guy with one bad attitude. I think I liked this movie because of the combination of bad characters and good comedy.

I will not watch the movie again until the end of the season but if I had to re-watch this movie now I would watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first of a two part drama set in the French Foreign Legion and it really does an excellent job of putting the whole Legion in a bad light while also showing the French Army in a positive light. It is a rather long movie but it does a good job at capturing the French spirit of sacrifice and perseverance. This is very good stuff and the French actors and actresses all are wonderful to watch. The movie really captures the spirit of the French in a way that makes me very proud to be French.   Recommended!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film begins with a girl named Nausicaa-chan (Kikuchi Aiko), an 11 year old, little girl who is an apprentice to the master of the Shinto shrine where she was born. In an attempt to gain the power of Shinto, she is asked to help the boy in the caretaker of the shrine in restoring the magic of the earth. As a result, she accidentally brings back a magical girl, Saki (Akagi Tetsuko). Saki takes Nausika under her wing and teaches her about her new abilities. Unfortunately, the magic that Nausie-chan gains has a devastating affect on both her body and spirit, causing her to lose her memory. She can not understand what is happening, and when Saki reveals that she is the reincarnation of the princess of the ancient kingdom of Shikoku (which had recently been destroyed in a battle between a god and a demon), Nausicas, and her father, are forced to flee the kingdom. Soon they find themselves living in the country of Tōkyō. This is where the plot of the film begins.   Saki is a powerful sorceress and Nausi-chan's body is rapidly deteriorating, losing its color and life. This leads to an even more destructive effect, leaving Nausik-chan almost as an outcast. While trying to regain her memory, Nausiko is visited by Shikirō (Yasuhiro Takemoto), the boy who has grown up in a castle as a boy, but as a man in Shikiron, a Shinto religion that mixes Shinto with the Japanese folk culture. He is a samurai, and a devout follower of Shishigami, a deity whose influence is said to be felt by all who come in contact with him. As the film progresses, Shikiritami seems to have an effect on Nausico-chan, and as she learns more and more of his religion, she decides to learn more too.  After seeing a dream that appears to be an image of Saki, Nusica-chan meets a monk, whose name is Kishiboh. In the dreams, Sāki is there, but she cannot remember what he looks like. This brings her to the realization that she can, in fact, remember Saki.  However, Shishige is the monk she must find, and the more she learns about Shishib

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What are the odds?! A group of high school kids in the middle of a desert stumble across a bizarre, eerie creature that has been terrorizing people all over the desert for many years. Their lives are turned upside down when they come face to face with this creature and discover that they are not alone in this world.     I remember watching this movie as a kid and I still remember what a weird and wonderful movie this was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in a big theater and the kids were having a blast. There was also a "movie" on the large screen. I was very impressed with the film as an action movie. The film was about a group of young kids who have to battle a giant. A great cast.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was like being on a roller coaster with some very good laughs and a few not so good ones. The movie had a great twist at the end that really made it stand out. It's not really a great movie but it's good. I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a "must see" if you are a fan of horror movies or want a good scare film. The film starts with a character called Lyle (Ray McKinnon) and his girlfriend Sarah (Pamela Heintz) having a good time in a cabin on the beach. Their cabin is empty and Lyle notices a strange noise coming from the window in the bathroom. He finds a girl, Linda (Jill Martin) and she tells him that a girl was murdered in the woods and that someone is coming to kill them. The cabin is a nightmare and Lile, Sarah, Linda and a police officer (Jackie Coogan) find themselves on the run after someone kills the last person to live there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the type of movie I can't stand to watch.   It is a low-budgeted, non-genre film.  The writer of the script, a man named John Z. Smith, tried to be like an Indiana Jones movie.  He had some of the same ideas about treasure and treasure hunting, and even the way he shot the pictures (with a Steadicam).   The acting was decent, not great, but still better than it needed to be.  However, the characters were completely lame.  There was no real sense of humor, only in the voice over in the ending.  Even the hero, Mr. Jones, was a dolt.  It just was not funny, and the story was rather boring.  I can tell by the opening title "The King of The Mountain" that this was a film that was made to be a hit. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this was a good comedy. It's not a typical movie like The Devil's Advocate, but a real, enjoyable comedy. I had a good time seeing the funny characters. The only thing that disappointed me was that one character, while funny, wasn't played by one of my faves.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like science-fiction then you should watch This is an excellent film that deals with many important issues about our society today. The premise of the film is that mankind has reached the point where it can't go forward in any more, it's too far gone and its going to fall apart. Its going to take an entire planet to stop this, so a global organization called The UN is created. The head of the organization is Dr. Richard R. Whitehead (Peter Weller). Dr. Whitehouse wants to save the earth from the planet-killing catastrophe.   This is a sci-fi movie that has a very unique feel to it. The story is set on the earth and Dr. R.Whitehouse is trying to create a colony on the moon in order to create life to last for an indefinite period. The UN has been trying to get this project off the ground but has run into numerous obstacles from the United States of America, which wants to preserve its dominance and dominance over the planet and the UN. The plot is very intriguing and the sci- fi elements really do add something different to the mix. The film also focuses a lot on characters. It is important to remember that this is a movie about the future and how human race will become extinct. This is why it makes sense that Dr.Whitehead is not the only character in the movie, there are many others. This movie is really a fascinating glimpse into the future. The movie is very well made and the script is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great! It has a great plot, great performances, great sound and it's a great movie to watch and re-watch.    It has a good plot:  In this movie we have the life story of a young boy named Paul and his girlfriend Mary. Both of them live a happy life and have a wonderful relationship. When Mary is diagnosed with cancer and they decide to make it through this difficult time. Paul is a very hard working and good natured man and he takes it upon himself to help Mary through this crisis.  In the movie Paul decides that his relationship with Mary is more important and that the two of them should share the burden of being a couple and to live through this tragedy together.  Paul has some strong opinions and is a bit hard headed which can sometimes cause problems in their relationship.  One of the reasons for Paul's hard headedness is his love for Mary and a little girl named Elizabeth who he often helps around the house and who he helps out with shopping.  Mary is the one who does most of the shopping and it is Mary who helps Paul cook and clean.  Unfortunately Mary is not as good at helping as Paul thinks she is.  The problem is that Mary is actually a bit lazy and does not help out as much as she thinks she does. Paul tries his best to make her help out but Mary always wants to go out to shopping, play with her friends, read or do something else.  There are times when Paul does want Mary to help but Mary gets lazy, so she has to do something herself.  This is where the movie gets really good and funny!   The movie is really funny because it is so real.  It has such a happy ending because after Mary gets her cancer and Paul helps her to fight it, she is cured.  They are happy and Paul and Mary are happily together for many years to come.  Sound is great:  The soundtrack of this movie is amazing.  You have all the music that you would expect in a movie like this and there is a lot of variety and interesting songs in this movie.  Each scene is narrated by a different person and the music changes with them.  Every scene is a great one!  The sound is great, it has a real live sound that gives a real feel to it.  A real good sound!  This has a fantastic soundtrack and I highly recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For many years I have been a fan of the "Barry Lyndon" franchise, and after reading the novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and watching all three "Berserk" films I have had the itch to see a new one. After watching the trailer I am hooked and looking forward to seeing this "Beserker". "On His Majesty's" Secret Service,"   A few months ago I read a review of "Bitter Lake" by Robert Ludlum. I was enthralled with his writing style and story-telling, and although it was hard to read I had to take a chance. I have to say I was really excited to read his book. I liked it more than I thought I would, but was not sure it would be an instant favorite. After reading it I am still enjoying it, but a bit more than the book suggests. As with "Brie" it is very hard to keep the characters at a straight course, and I am not sure who the "right" person is. This is an enjoyable ride, but I have a feeling this will end up being a one-and-done, and will be gone before I finish it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a pretty standard "sci-fi" movie but in its way it has a strong plot. I don't know if I should call it a sci-fi film because its all about the space travel. The story is kind of slow but if you can't like space then this is not for you. As with most sci-fis this is about technology and how the people deal with it.  The thing that struck me about the movie is the music. I had never heard a music score from this movie and it was something I was not expecting to hear. The opening theme is a good example.    Another thing that was nice was the special effects. They are good enough but not mind blowing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love movies about crime. They're always so well acted, and I love seeing the way that the actors take what they learn and learn it well. I loved seeing the two criminals who were hired by the police to catch one of the killers. The first was a big bad man who was out to get his own back, and was as ruthless as he was violent. I liked him because he was a bit of a character, and his attitude toward life was one I could relate to. I was very impressed with his ability to put his own interests before anything else. When he wasn't at work, he would go on about his love of hunting animals and taking pictures of them. That would have been a good plot for an action film. The second was a little less bad, and more of a bit player. He seemed to like the people he was robbing, and had a bit too much fun with his victims. He would often try to play nice with them and get them to do his dirty work for him. I didn't find him very sympathetic, though, and it's not like the story is really his fault. He did what he did for the money, and made no attempt to do anything else for anyone. He only took pictures and killed the poor things because he wanted their skins.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -  It was a great movie.   I don't think I have ever seen a movie like this. The whole thing was good.   The story was like a detective story.

This movie is not to be taken lightly and I highly recommend this movie to all those who are a fan of action or a fan or of the sci fi genre.   My wife and I watched it last night and it had a good amount of laughs and not much more and it was worth the price. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never watched "The Day the Earth Stood Still," the book which has the film as its sequel. The film is not really a sequel of the book; instead, it is about a young scientist (Tom Hanks) who travels back in time and meets a young woman who is from Earth (Jennifer Connelly) in the late 1960s. After the woman leaves, the scientist goes to investigate a mystery in her past. The movie was quite good. The acting was excellent. The cinematography was well done. I don't have much of a review for this because there are just so many good things to say about it. It was a good time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would say this movie is a really good movie. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can't say why I like this movie so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts with some great animation, a beautiful soundtrack, and an amazing cast. I love how they brought back the original series actors like Mio Yamada, Shiro Sagisu, and Sōichirō Mizoguchi, and I like how the character development continues and is more fleshed out and interesting. It may sound silly, but I would like to see how the original manga and the movies are written. The story is very simplistic, but also very interesting, especially for a TV series. You'll get to see the characters in a new light and also get a chance to see them interacting with each other in different situations. I am not a big fan of the series though, I have grown to love them more and more each time I watched it, but the movie is good enough to bring me back to them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie in the first place - if there is no "plot" and all the "characters" can be played by one person in two or three minutes - that is just plain "good", so well done, I just don't see the point of being funny about it.   - and, I'm not saying there are not good jokes in this movie.  - -   What I like is how "hilarious" is the character who is, after all, a "sketchy" and "dramatic" actor:  - well, for a long time he is "dying", and he is getting really tired of being a "star", so he gives up and decides to "become a good actor" with a lot of difficulty - then the people that he is trying to become famous with, are the actors from the old Hollywood studios.  I like how he keeps telling them "don't play the part, make your own" - that's hilarious!   I think this movie is "a good one to laugh at".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a while there, it seemed as if the internet would be the end of the world, that the web would be more and more popular all the time, that everyone would love to be in a virtual world in which they could meet new and interesting people. What we have here, is a story about a young man who decides to get his life back together after a tragic accident leaves him crippled, alone and with few chances to make his mark on the world. It was a strange and depressing movie, that did not show anything interesting about the world we live in today, instead it showed us some rather unpleasant aspects about our society, its values, its morals, its attitudes, and its people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this about a year ago on the big screen.   It's a well-made movie, but the one problem I had with it is that it was boring.  The story starts out by showing the character who is responsible for the crime and then the prosecutor who was investigating his case.  And then the story was left for the end when the murderer is going to be tried and the character was not to be found.  It would have been nice to see the character when the prosecutor was searching for him and he's not to get his hand off the wheel.  Then the prosecutor is also to blame when he leaves the evidence at the place of the crime.  There was no suspenseful ending to the movie.  I don't know what to think about this movie.    I think I need to watch the movie again to get a better understanding about what the film is about.  If you liked it, please leave a comment with your rating and review.

The film has a wonderful soundtrack and a beautiful movie to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter and I had a terrific time seeing "The Adventures of Max & Furiosa". It's an animated fantasy story with a great character. The action is fast paced and the special effects are really pretty, but the voice acting was really not to my liking. For a cartoon there was not a lot of character development in the movie, and in fact, it felt a bit like an episode of a TV show. However, the action is great and the characters really do come to life. I'd say a PG-13 would not be out of place here, but I think it is too much to ask. It is a great movie and I wish there were more sequels! I don't think the voice actors for the two main characters are good, but it's a cartoon. It's fun! I think they should put a band together and make a sequel.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So it has been a couple of weeks and I have been able to watch most of the movies that have come out.   Some have been more good than others.  Some like "Dead Man" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" are really, really good.  But the worst thing I saw was "The Mummy" with Sigourney Weaver, that was so awful I was just shocked.  And one day I will write a review for the whole series, since I really like these movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's been said that the best movie is the one with no story," so they say. That's a wonderful, poetic way to think about a wonderful movie that is a work of genius. It's a tale of a girl who must learn to work through the pain of her mother's death to try to save her father's soul. I won't spoil it by explaining what the story is about, but the way it is told is one of the best. You know the feeling of being at the bottom of a lake. You're in a world with no bottom. I've never seen a movie like this. It is an intense experience of a woman finding her way through grief and loss to find meaning, peace and connection. It isn't easy. She is in pain and must work through it. I loved it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . The first of the three part series about the life of a serial killer.   The series, based on the popular BBC television show of the same name, follows the life and criminal activities of Ian Brady (Terrance Dicks) and his accomplice, John Kilbride (Alan Rickman). The series follows the crimes and murders that occur across the London area as Brady's life is constantly turned upside down as he tries to clear his name while being investigated by the police, his former friends, his family and his employer, the British government.  The two parts are 'The Murder Game' (Part I), 'The Suicide Game' and 'The Rackets Game' which in my opinion are all very well made.  I think the first part of the series is the best of the four with the 'Death Game' being fairly dull. I do however feel the second part has the potential to be a great series.  As far as I am concerned, the only thing I can think of missing from the two series is a series finale which would have been the perfect way to end the story.  Summary of Part I: The series starts with Ian Brady being taken into custody after a shooting spree at a bank. This does not seem to be much of an investigation as Brady is a poor shot so the police have no problem with the case and take him home and interrogate him. Brady says he got in a fight and stabbed a man in the head and then went off to the toilet and then called the police for backup. He also says that his girlfriend, Kate (Lizzy Caplan) is in the room with him and tells the police he got the knife from his room and had to kill the man he stabbed to get to her. Brady insists that the man must have been lying and he has the knife at his house for when he wants to hurt someone. The police don't buy his story and think that the incident could just as well have been a robbery. Brady is questioned about the knife and seems to think it is in his bag but when he opens it and looks at it he says it is a machete. He is taken away and is questioned by the investigating police and it is clear that they believe Brady's story. After a while, Brady is released to go home but when it is too late his girlfriend shows up at his front door. Brady doesn't tell her what happened so she comes out of the house to find Brady
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favourite movie about the war. I watched the last part about the last German officer before they go home. The last scene where the soldier is walking on a beach, I was scared to go there, and then I saw a soldier walking on the other side of the beach. It was so funny! And the music was beautiful. The only thing I didn't like was that one of the German soldiers was naked. Maybe they had a really good idea because I liked to watch the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was never a huge fan of films like this one.  I think they were usually just an excuse to bring a bunch of new actors on board and then to give them a movie that made them famous.  It did happen and I'm glad they made the effort because this was good.   Unfortunately, there isn't much of a plot here but this is a good little comedy that is fun to watch.  There are some minor parts that aren't so much funny but just plain stupid.  The acting was not all that good but there was enough of them.  If this were on TV instead of a movie, this would be a hit. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the spring of 1999, the world's tallest cat had just arrived in the back room of a coffee shop in a small town in rural Minnesota. He had been found in a trash can behind a church, and the townspeople were convinced he'd been stolen and used as a human prop in a horror movie. However, when a group of teenagers are sent on a field trip to find the missing cat, the cat's whereabouts are far from clear. The film's only star is a young girl named Samantha, who happens to be the town's veterinarian. With a few other children, she has to help her family with the search and a few unfortunate deaths along the way. When a local man named Peter comes along as a volunteer searcher, the group discovers that something even more sinister is afoot.   This is one of those films that you really need to see twice in order to get the full picture of what you are getting into. The story is good, but nothing extraordinary, and for this type of movie, it works. You don't need to be a horror fanatic to appreciate it; the basic story is really just a bit of camp. You'll never really get a grasp on why there is a cat called Godzilla in the first place, though that might not be a problem for people who haven't seen it, as it doesn't do a great job of explaining its origin either. The plot is not terribly original either, although a good deal of it is based on the works of other directors, most notably the great H.P. Lovecraft. However the story's most important component is Samantha, the young girl with an inquisitive mind and a passion for all things strange and new, and she does a terrific job of bringing all of the characters to life.  Sam's curiosity and her love for science combined to produce the first genuine Godzilla film ever made! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this film very entertaining.   As a film-goer myself, I enjoyed the fact that this film is set in a historical setting.  With the exception of the story and the characters, I felt that most of the film could be placed in a period of the early 20th century.  I also found that the acting was very realistic.  The acting of most of these characters were excellent.  This was a very fun and entertaining movie.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the more enjoyable movies I have ever seen in a cinema.   It has the same feel as some of the films that are from the old war movies, that are a bit rough and to the point, but it is a lot better than that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a big fan of all kinds of fantasy movies, but I really don't want to give my money to a remake of a well-known film.   This movie is a remake that I believe did a really good job of bringing up a great fantasy world with interesting and well-drawn characters.  I think the movie could have been better, but it's fun, I liked it, and if you like fantasy films then it will be worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born in 1969 and watched a lot of Star Trek movies and television shows. They have a certain charm and I really like the Enterprise. This was my first viewing and my favorite one. I am not a Star Trek fan and it took me a minute to connect to this show. I liked it a lot. I enjoyed the way this movie was shot. You could see what was happening at any time on the bridge. It was a lot more exciting than the earlier movies. I would have liked to see more about these guys and the women. The special effects were fantastic. The sound was a bit too loud for my taste, but the music was excellent. This was a fun and good movie to watch. It has a great cast and a good plot.

I'm sure this movie wouldn't have been as good if it wasn't for the acting in this movie. It wasn't like the two other movies and there was more character development in this one too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was great!   My husband is a movie buff. I was looking for a good old fashioned family movie with some action and romance. I liked how the kids were not a lot of them, just normal kids and the mother is a bit more than a "lady of the night". The father is really the star of this movie. He was great. He would be great as a hero or a bad guy. I would like to see a sequel or some other type of spin-off.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason to see this movie is because of the plot.    This is a sci-fi comedy, set in a sci -fi dystopia where everyone has a small spaceship to live in that travels to other planets.  The plot is pretty bad at first, but it gets better as the movie goes on, and the plot does improve over the course of the movie.  A great sci-Fi movie with a good plot, and some funny moments too.  If you can watch this movie in 3 minutes and get a chuckle out of it, then by all means, go watch it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed it. It has a good story, a good plot and a good ending, though the ending is kind of rushed and the resolution is rather "no big deal". It's probably not meant to be a good comedy.   As the ending credits are getting going, a woman is playing a violin at the piano. The piano starts playing. A voice comes over the radio, saying "I am now a part of this country... and it will never be the same again." It starts to get very surreal, and very creepy. At the piano, the woman says "Let's play like we were meant to." At this point, the music just becomes very, very heavy, and the man says "I'm sorry, it's only for a little while." The man comes across as not all that confident (not even sure how a man who thinks he's a good violinist can become a woman) and kind of sad. When he leaves, he doesn't even bother to take the violin with him.

I drove to the theater, got there early and sat down for a good 2 hours watching all the trailers and playing the games that were on the big screen. By the time I finished the film, the entire house of me was tired. We just watched the film. I felt really bad for him.   The movie is very good. I enjoyed the characters and the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this one when I was in high school, and it holds up well today. It's a great romantic comedy, with a bit of a slasher vibe and a lot of fun as the two main characters struggle to get to know each other. The main male lead, Sam (John Cusack), is a good guy who wants to be a detective, but he's never really been able to because he's shy and doesn't like making people feel uncomfortable, which can be hard on people around him. One night a couple of guys get into a fight that leaves one of them dead, and Sam has to work out where they came from before the coroner arrives.   It's all about people, and if people can learn to get along with one another and take care of each other they can have a great time doing it.  This movie is set in the 1930s, and that's when movies like this are made, with all the weird shit they could put in the script.  They get even weirder with a ghost called The Phantom (David J. Smith) who haunts a diner in a house that looks like the one where Dorothy and the Wicked Witch of the East live in the Oz film, except that it's haunted by a guy in a white coat and he's been trying to kill everyone who lives there.  He's also a murderer (it's a very creepy movie) and I don't like him at all, but at least he's pretty much a guy who doesn't seem to care that he's a murderer or even that he likes killing people.  The cast are all really good actors, even if I'm not a big fan of Cusacks (he's probably my favorite actor from the 80s and 90s). I particularly liked David J. as Sam, and while he's not that good of a director, he's clearly a great actor. He was also the co-writer and co-producer on this film and apparently was also a producer on the other movie (it was never released because it's so bad). I'm kind of surprised it didn't get much better than this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this at a drive in and the first act was fun and fast paced, the second was slow paced, but not a bad slow paced movie. I love the way the character's personalities were portrayed. There were a few jokes about the fact that she has a brother but I didn't get too many of them.    One more thing I like about this movie: The music was very good and I didn' t like that the soundtrack was a little repetitive, but I liked it and that's what counts in a good horror movie, you gotta have good music in a horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first saw this film on a college campus, and it was one of those experiences that will stick with you for a long time.   It's a simple tale, but it's one of the more powerful films I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A classic story about the life and death of a small boy and the man who loved him.   I was born a month before this movie was released.  This movie is a classic.  It is a tale about a poor young boy named "Tommy" who was found by a woman named "Mary" (I have to admit she was pretty), and his love for a doll called "Ella".  It takes a while for this boy to learn to respect people and to be the boy that everyone else was looking to for guidance. He was a very sensitive, sensitive, boy.  As a boy he would often be seen weeping in front of his dolls and the woman loved him enough to take him in.  The man who loves him was a man named Mr. T.  Tommy's life took a turn when he lost his mother in a tragic car accident when he was just three years old.  Mary took Tommy in, and Tommy's mother had always been a devoted mother, and her last memory of Tommy is of Tommy holding his mother's hand as she lay dead in the car.  His grief was so overwhelming that he did not even want to talk about it for a while.  After his mother died, Tommy began to do odd jobs around town, but he still had his doll.  He was very intelligent and was able to learn many things from his dolls, even as a young man he was able find a way to teach himself a few things, and his mind quickly took hold of himself.  One day he found a dead girl at the bottom of a well. It was later found out that a young woman had been beaten to death by a group of men.  However the men had tried to use Tommy to lure a woman into their van, but Tommy refused to help them, and instead made sure they all went to jail.  Once that was over he began to work on his own, eventually moving on to become an artist.  Even while growing up Tommy was always a good friend to others.  There are no happy endings in this movie, or in the story of this boy who grew up to become the man that everyone wanted him to be.  When he was about to graduate from high school he died, his mother would never see him again.  I had a chance to see this film when it was on TV a while back, but I'm so glad that I saw it again. This film has a very special
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My only negative about this movie is that it is very short.   It's the end of the day and your dog is missing.  He has been missing for 4 hours and you are left trying to figure out what is going on and where is he.  It seems as if the other people are making a lot of noise, and it's getting louder.  A couple of guys decide to go out to look for their dog, but they also get a little noisy.  The ending scene is pretty much what you get when you think about the movie: you have to walk all over the neighborhood trying to find the dog.  This movie is not for the faint of heart.  There is lots of blood, and I've seen that before.  If you like movies with a dark theme, this is a good one.  Don't forget to bring a flashlight because if your dog has even a single scratch it will not be good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good thriller, or a little horror. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm in the middle of a rewatch of this movie and have to say I'm enjoying it a lot. The ending of the movie is also very much in line with the movie I was hoping to get out of the box: The film ends with a little girl being told that a demon is in her family and that the girl is to stay in bed and stay out of trouble. This is the perfect ending to a story I didn't like that much. If you liked a good horror movie, especially a Halloween one, I'd recommend this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best of the best films that have been made by directors Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.   I was at a cinema when I saw it and I was thinking to myself "Oh yeah I remember that one.  That was a great movie"   Well it was great.  It has a great story line, an awesome soundtrack by John Williams, some fantastic action sequences and beautiful visuals by legendary special effects guys like Doug Trumbull, I know because I watched the trailer for it before I even saw it.  One of my favourite films of all time, it's a true story about a dog who's owner is killed in a car crash and the dog is left to look after himself.  I like to think I'm an animal lover but I can't stand dogs and I really enjoyed it when the dog was left to die in the middle of the desert.  My favourite scene was when the poor little dog was being left to rot in the hot sun and I actually burst into tears.  George Lucas should be proud of his work and I think he's one of the greatest directors around.  I don't even know what to say about this movie.  The first 15 minutes are brilliant.  They go right to the heart of what this film is about and it's about the love and friendship that develops between a man and a dog.  This film is very moving and has the perfect ending.  A wonderful film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I should say this movie is excellent. It is certainly not the best movie in the series (that is the fourth installment), but it is certainly an enjoyable one. There are only so many ways to show a battle scene, and this movie takes the classic formula in a different way that still gives you a solid fight scene. The character work is excellent; the acting is excellent, and the special effects are just brilliant (not quite as good as the second one, but still very good). The fight scenes, while not quite as great as the first film, are still very enjoyable. The story is great, and it has an almost Shakespearean quality to it that makes it all work well, but it also does a lot of things that are slightly different. The pacing is a bit off from the first movie, with the opening sequence being quite abrupt, but once the movie starts, it is excellent (not great by any means, but excellent). The battle scenes are actually not so great in the first one, and by the end of this one, they actually are pretty good.   Final Thoughts   This movie is just great. The best one in the entire series. It may not be the best one from a purely action perspective, but in the middle of the battle scenes, it definitely has the most fun, and that is what counts the most.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to try and avoid any spoilers. I am sure there are, but I don't want to know. I like the style of the film, though it has some flaws. I'm sure a lot of people like it, so I hope that this review helps with a comparison. The film is set in a town which is run by a family. The family have one child who is very good looking and is also a star athlete. There is a family friend of his who is always very upset about his little brother dying a horrible death. He has a brother who is on the other side of the world (I believe the time is in the late 1940's), and the little brother is not like him at all, though he is very kind. The little brother's father is a very rich man and the only son. He is a horrible man. He does whatever he likes. He rapes women and even has the townspeople as sex slaves. This is not unusual in the movie, but it's so bad it's funny. He also has a son who has a little sister, and the girl has a mother and a sister. This has made the little sister a bit resentful of her mother, and it's the little son who tries to get her back. It also makes his father very unhappy, since the little boy has a lot more than the money he needs. The story also has the little girl falling for a man. The husband is a man of the family (as in, a family member is married to a family relative) and is not as good looking as his wife. The wife is very nice, but the husband is rather unpleasant, and does not do well in social situations. The only thing good about him is that he never takes her to the cinema. He's afraid it's going to change her life. It's a movie about a small town, and in the small town there are always bad people (and I'm not even sure there is a good guy in it, but that's a story for another day).   When I first read the book by Erskine Caldwell, I thought this was a good book, but after seeing the movie it turned me off. The plot seems very simple. The good-looking kid falls in love with the evil man's daughter (who is a pretty good- looking woman) and they both move away to live apart, with the daughter marrying a wealthy man and going to a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never heard of the book before I read it, and it was a delight to read about. This is a very funny book. It's not about how hard people work, but about how far they will go to get their own way. As a bonus, the book features a character who doesn't like people who are bad. I guess this is a good thing for people who like people that don't like them. This book really is a classic, and if you like good fun, then this is the book for you!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on the 16th of May 2007, and as a fan of films like "Lucky Number Slevin" (1943) and "The Secret of NIMH" (1970) I knew that this movie would be fun and not too scary. I went in with the understanding that I was going to watch a film on the horror genre, and was not disappointed.   The acting was solid and I found this film really entertaining and interesting.  After watching this movie, I believe that it will be a staple in horror film collection for the rest of my life, and will always hold a place as a top notch horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the first one that I watched of this new series and it is awesome.  This movie, especially in the first half of the movie is awesome!  The movie is funny and really different from the usual one.  I like that they added a little bit of a comedy at the end of the series.  The main character of the story is called  Dr.    Atsushi Matsumoto, and he is the leader of a new group of people that came to a town called Tokyo.  There were some incidents that happened when they were there that is why they came there.  A new group called   The   New   Group.  When the group came to Tokyo, they came to kill some people who happened to be there when they first came to Japan.  That is why we saw a lot of people who died.  Then they came back to Tokyo with their group, but when they come back, they were attacked by some enemies and they lost all the friends that they had and all their money and things they had.  They tried to find some other people to join the group that they came with and they came up with Atsugi Matsumotto.  He is a genius like all the other people that he comes across.    He has a special gun that shoots out something like a laser that makes enemies explode!   I have to admit that there are a few parts where the movie takes a bit of long to get going.   But, it is an awesome movie, that I definitely recommend to anyone that is a fan of sci-fi! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie, with some good acting and good story.    The film is about a man who lives in a farm in the country and has a lot of animals.  One of the things he sees is a strange creature that lives in the field.  So he gets a dog to go after it.  Once it is dead, they go and get a rope to drag it out.  And once it is up they bring it out to a pond and tie it up.  In the process, they kill the dog.  Now a while later a little girl comes out to find what was done to the dog, and what it means.  The man thinks it's a fairy.  At first it makes no sense and the little girl is a bit confused, but then the girl says she knows it must mean the end of the world if she is killed by the dog and so it must be a girl with a dog.     This film has many good things about it, but the acting is a little poor.  I liked the character of the farmer and the farmer's wife who is rather good looking.  There were some scenes where I thought the wife could have done a better job with the character, but we have only two stories.  This movie should be a favorite of mine.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The idea for this film had been around for a long time. It is essentially a version of the Russian comedy of manners, and it is more entertaining that I expected. It's also funny, but it's not quite as good as The Producers, which I love.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter and I saw the movie about the people who were killed by the train wreck in Santa Fe. It was a great movie and really made me feel sad for the people in the train. There was a very real feeling of doom and danger about it. I know there are some people who are saying this movie is nothing but a sad, but there are so many different aspects to this movie. You have this group of children who are trying to rescue a child they have never met before from the train wreckage. There is a very sad and powerful scene where one of the children who is trying to save her friend's child from the same fate says to the children to run back. It is a beautiful scene and it was such a great line to me when the man yelled "Run back!" in the movie! I also loved the little things we learn about the characters. The children were really like little children in a lot of ways. You learn they are all the same age. They have similar interests. And you get to see that some of them are more like grown ups and have the same problems they had as children. Some of the most moving scenes were when these children had to come to grips with their emotions and how to deal with the tragedy they were facing. We learn the children were all very close to each other and how they all have a hard time coming to terms with the death of their friend. The movie is about loss and the struggle to cope with it and the children come together as a group to try to understand and cope with what is going to happen to them. It felt a little like a real life movie about a tragedy and how people come together to try and heal from it. The only thing that was a little sad was that we never saw the father. The kids never saw him and we never got to know him well enough to get any emotional connection. We only get to know his sister but we are never shown that her heart was just as bad as her brother. It doesn't mean her heart wasn't broken and that her brother was not lost and it doesn't take away from the loss and tragedy that the boys in the group were facing in their small town of Santa Fe, New Mexico. They were friends, neighbors, classmates, and family. This movie was very real and that's why it was a wonderful movie to me. I recommend this movie for all those who are going to lose a loved one in a tragedy. You can also get a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A little over six minutes, but still worth the watch.   I thought the film was fantastic.  When I saw a movie with the words "In Space," I thought I was watching a science fiction movie, but as I was sitting there watching it, the characters were really believable.  The story of a spaceship, a robot and a woman on an alien world are very well done, and I liked the ending very much.  I could really relate to the two characters.  My only gripe with the movie is the use of music by John Barry. It does seem to repeat itself a few times.  At the very least, I did enjoy the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a massive fan of George Lucas. He has a gift for telling a good story. And, this movie is a good good story with a little bit of Star Wars flavor.   This movie is about a space bounty hunter named R2D2 who finds his old partner, C3PO. They help the Rebellion find a secret droid, the droid has stolen the plans to the Death Star. The plan is to use a giant black hole to destroy the Death star before the Rebels can destroy it. The Rebellion must make their way to the planet Kothlis and blow up the Death stars. R2 and C3 are the only two who know the plans and it would mean their lives if they were discovered. They start on a mysterious mission and they eventually find the secret base. But before they can reach Kothlia, they get a bad bad bad news. The base is already taken by the Empire and they have to hide. They decide to try and use the Death STAR plans. But there is a problem: they are all being used by Imperial forces and they might be destroyed. So, they must find a way to get the plans back to the Rebellion without losing their lives. This is a great Star Wars story.  I had a lot of fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it is. I'm not sure that it's a good enough movie as far as being a good, but it's better than a lot of other movies.   The movie opens up with a scene of a beautiful girl and the guys coming to her apartment. They don't know what to do with her so they go on and on about it. They all sit around playing cards and drinking beer. A very nice opening of that type of movie.  This girl is very pretty, but very shy and nervous, but she's in love with a guy and she's not going to tell him because she doesn't want her mother to find out. We are then introduced to the guy. He's a pretty good guy but a bit of a bad boy and she still wants to be with him. The guy goes on and she doesn;t tell him anything about her feelings but at least he seems to be nice to her. The guys keep talking about her, but the girl isn't interested in them at all. She just wants to talk to the guys and go to bed.  Then, she goes to sleep.  There is a strange thing that happens to her, which she finds hard to believe.  The next morning the guys are all outside, still talking about how she looks like when she was a girl.  But, they are now all very nice and there is no jealousy in them. She is really happy about it, too.  We are still talking, but there's a strange feeling in the air and she keeps thinking about the guy she once liked so much.  He's not really what she thought, but that doesn't matter to her because she likes him a lot.  She's still thinking about him, and she suddenly gets very, very nervous.  And she goes upstairs to the bedroom.  I find this to be a really nice thing about the movie. It's really refreshing to see a woman get very nervous at the thought of being with a man.  What's more, I find her nervous because she realizes she may be losing her virginity to him.  It's a very sweet scene, which is very much in character for the movie and one of the best of the bunch.  After that, we are introduced to a new character who we are never going to see again. She looks exactly like the girl from the first scene, but her eyes are different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not expect this movie to be any good at all, but after I saw it, I was pleasantly surprised.   The movie opens with a short narration, which is narrated by a girl named Kimi. She tells us that she is going to the beach with her two friends, Kato and Kaoru. The beach is full of beautiful people, and Kimi asks her friends to introduce her to the guy who she likes the most. She asks Kato if he likes cute girls, and he says that she looks so cute. Kato says that her body looks so amazing, and she looks like a real beauty. Kaoru says that there is a girl who likes him, and then she calls Kato's name. Katao says that Kimi is beautiful, but she's also really scary. KATO IS A KIND PERSON! (This is what she says.)   Then Kaoru calls Kimi by name, and the two girls go on a date. Kaoro tells us what they do when they're alone. Kimi talks about how she likes to play and swim. Kaori tells her that the girl she likes is the one who made her fall in love with swimming, and that the whole town is jealous of her. Katarina is jealous because of her friend's jealousy. Kaio is sad because of his friends' jealousy. But then Kimi, Kaoro, and Kataoi all start swimming in a strange water. Kaoruko tells us about how it was the first time she had done this kind of swim. Kim i then begins to laugh, and swims away! Kimi tells Kaoru to follow her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Candyman was a solid film. The plot is simplistic: a candy maker (Michael Caine) gets caught up in a crime wave after the death of his wife. This is a classic horror tale with a nice twist at the end.   The only problem is that it only has two reels, no dubbing (or, at least, it didn't for me), and a cheesy score that does nothing to make the movie any less boring.    It's a nice short horror/mystery film that I wish I could've seen more of.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is great to see a director making a movie where everything comes from a good source. And what's great about this is, I don't think we can say the same about a lot of the films the Directors makes. And that is a really good thing. You see this movie is actually a continuation of a series that started in the 70's (I forget where) and ended in the 90's. It seems that in these years, the Director had become quite self-aware. You start out in a house with a bunch of strangers who live there as tenants for some one. And one of the strangers, a young man, turns out to be a brilliant thief. He steals money from an armored car and, with the help of his friends, escapes and escapes again and another guy is caught and is sentenced. The rest of the movie follows these characters through many adventures and in each adventure they find that there is more to what the "guests" are after than they thought. There is much more that goes on than what is in these reviews show and this movie contains just about all you could ever want or need to know about the subject.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this film for my 10th birthday and it is a very good movie.  I found this movie very entertaining and I love the way they filmed this movie and I found it easy to follow. I love all the characters and I really enjoyed this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when I was a little kid. I liked it a lot! My older brother and I were driving down the road, he was saying that the movie was like a good old western. This movie was about a young man named Taggart, he's about 7, he and his two older brothers are traveling up into Canada to run some gold mines. I remember that this was one of those movies that you saw and felt like you were going to like it!   The movie starts with a scene that I found really cool, it shows Taggarty, his wife, and his kids playing in a little river, it makes me think about where my own kids are!  I also found the soundtrack very good, I always liked old westerns with really nice music.   My only problem is that I don't remember the name of the movie, I think it was called the Cattle King. I think there is a good girl in this movie.  I think I know where I can find some of it...   It has a great soundtrack, it's kind of like "Cattle Call" but more "Dirty Harry".

I mean, what's not to love? You have an astronaut on a mission, and not just any astronaut. This astronaut is a former military pilot who has fallen out of orbit, but it's not as if this space alien is going to shoot down the plane. You see, this dude is a space pirate, who needs help and a little bit of magic to get back home. So he starts doing the kind of things the military pilots do: making magic and saving the day, and if that weren't enough, he's the only one with enough power to save a ship. But he doesn't know how to use the magic so he ends up having a bit of a problem, but don't worry, once he uses his magic to open a rift into a new dimension (a dimension that's full of awesome alien creatures!) he can go back home, and once he does, it's going to be a whole new ball game."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie a lot. It's about a kid who has to run away from home to survive. So, it's pretty self-explanatory. I think it's more realistic than some of the other movies I saw like this one or "Nightmare Before Christmas". There is a lot of action, which is good, the kids are not too scary but they are interesting and you never feel bad for them. This movie does not follow the normal pattern of kids being abused in some sort of hellish place or anything like that, but it doesn't even have to. It just is a normal kid's life that has a twist at the end. I don't even know what to say about the ending... it's quite sad and weird.    If you are looking for a good horror movie or you like kids, I really recommend this movie to you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is funny. The story is not original. It is about a girl who is a teacher but works as a babysitter to support her two kids.   Her daughter is a nerd and her son a trouble maker.  When the kids are having a problem with a neighbor who seems to have no moral compass, a man, and the kid's dad decides to solve the problem.  I was not a fan of this but that is about it.  A few more like this would make this a must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the name says. It's a horror flick with some action. The actors are good and are all acting for the most part, but I was disappointed because I didn't like the character's acting. They were all too nervous to do their jobs. The camera was really good, but there was no lighting or sound at all.   The sound was fine and all the actors were good, just all too worried.  Posted by Anonymous at 7:13 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's not too many movies that will bring to mind this one, which in itself was not too bad. In fact, this movie was more of a comedy than it was a horror movie, which was a little disappointing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film centers around three young people living in a small California town (in the year 1980). As the movie starts out the young men are enjoying the good life with their college age wives. However, that all changes when they discover a very strange phenomena going on around them. What they don't know is that the whole place has been turned into a very peculiar, dark and disturbing world inhabited by a large number of strange monsters. This is where the mystery begins. The plot is simple: the three friends have to venture out in search of a powerful gem, a crystal of some kind. In this world the gem is called the Gem of Amun. The Gem of Osiris is said to have been stolen by the Pharaoh in his quest for a better world. The characters in this film are extremely well-drawn. You don't need to be a science-fiction fan to enjoy this movie. The costumes and makeup (and acting) are excellent, and the film itself is not too heavy-handed. There is a nice amount of action scenes (especially the last one in which all of the monsters are shown at one time). The film is very well-paced and it is easy to follow the various plot threads. All of the characters, especially the three young friends are very well developed. All three of them have a lot to say in the movie and make some really interesting, colorful, and original characters. One thing I do like about this movie is the music. The movie was made in 1982 and I remember the music was really good. The music, especially during the ending song, is very ominous in nature and it really makes the film quite frightening at times.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have no idea why, but for whatever reason, I really didn't like the movie. I mean I thought it was OK, I was enjoying it a lot (as opposed to that terrible remake of the same film I just saw). So I think I'm really going to enjoy this remake.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie from the 1950s.   An old-school Hollywood gangster film with wonderful actors who are very much in the style of the times.  The film is about the lives of the three "street" thugs of a particular Hollywood street.  They go about their daily business and have a few "spontaneous" encounters.  This film is more about the two characters who take the gangster's life over and over again in order to get what they want.  Very entertaining and with a great supporting cast.  I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to those who like a good old-fashioned, Hollywood gangsters film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many people, I was taken with the premise that a "human" was in charge of a "space" ship that was "sitting" around for so long that it got so boring, that it decided to escape.  This movie also had great performances and a good concept.  If you like space/sci-fi movies, this should not be missed!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half is good. It's pretty bad ass. There's some pretty crazy stuff happening, but you're still pretty impressed by the sheer force of Will Smith's will, the chemistry with Jada Pinkett-Smith, and the acting.   If you're a fan of the Will Smith character, this is definitely something to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am new to this site. I watched the movie "The Legend of Bagger Vance" on a Sunday night with my daughter, a family friend and my friend. We all were just having fun. It is a good little movie that has a few good laughs in it. I think that this movie was filmed in a small theater. It has a good cast of actors. The movie is a little boring and repetitive. It does start off with a nice opening sequence of a young man who goes to the desert looking for gold. I am not sure how he was able to get there. I did not notice any people in this movie. It just is. The character of Bagnold has a beautiful voice that I love! I was very happy when I heard it for the first time. The music in the movie was not very pleasant to my ears. There was a nice amount of time between the musical number. The ending sequence was good. I wish that there was more dialogue in the ending sequences. I would have liked to see more of Boggie Vance, Bagger's companion and some other characters. It was a fun movie to watch with a few laughs. I give this movie a 4.75.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the film I grew up on when I was young. It is my absolute favorite film.   It is funny, and sad, and touching.  The whole film is about the little girl who is born with a disability that will severely hinder her life, and all the adults that have no idea that she will be so much happier if they did not keep up with her.  I have never seen this kind of movie that does not make you wonder what is wrong with you.  It's a simple movie that has a very beautiful message about how we all are equal, and there is a reason you do not have to live in a world with people like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great film by Martin Scorsese and a great cast of actors.   Scorsesi is not the kind of filmmaker who just goes in to a movie and makes a movie. He does a good job of telling a good story about a family that just can't seem to make it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a true classic. It's not a pretty movie, it's not the best movie ever, but it's a great movie. This movie doesn't make any of the usual movies of this genre look bad, it looks great. It is a very good movie. The acting is great, and the action is epic. A movie that will be with you for years to come. It took me years to realize how good this movie is. I watched it over and over again and was never bored. This is a must see movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said in the intro, I went in expecting to be shocked or entertained, and this movie didn't disappoint in either of those aspects. The way the story is told really did surprise me, not in the sense of "oh, I could never have guessed this would happen", but rather in the way the characters were portrayed and the way it played out. I would even say the movie could even be compared to a bad teen comedy, only that it's a teen comedy where the teen comedy is done with a more subtle, but still pretty gross, touch. The only one I really didn't like about the movie was the ending, but I also did not hate the movie either, so really it was a mixed bag of good and bad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all I have to say that this movie is great.  It has everything a bad movie should have: bad acting, bad story, bad characters, and bad acting.  I mean, the whole movie is just a huge plot hole that is filled with nothing but bad acting and bad characters.  A bad movie needs bad acting to make it bad.  So the story is actually kind of entertaining.  There are a bunch of kids with bad lives (that's what they do), but their lives are not boring (like most bad movies) and they do have a good time.  When all of them start playing Dungeons and Dragons one of them gets so obsessed that he starts doing really bad things.   He starts to do really bad stuff to his mother and even gets himself burned with acid.  The movie is actually really well written.  As bad as the movie is, I didn't find myself laughing out loud and I didn,t get bored.  Also, the movie did a good job at showing the "real world" side of Dungeons and Dragon.  But this movie isn't exactly like a good bad movie.  Because it's still an evil movie.    I like bad movies that make me laugh.  This movie doesn't make me either laugh or think.  And when all the kids get together in a dungeon, they still don't seem to have much fun (unless they are playing Dungeons) and when they are all in a room (for like 5 minutes), they still get bored (for a good 90 minutes) and start talking about how bad they think the world is.   I hate to be the guy that says this but this movie might actually make me hate fantasy movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little skeptical at first since this is not the typical "solo crime" movie but I was very pleasantly surprised by the script and the cast.   The story is a little slow since you don't really get the big payoff until the third act but the overall pace is good so far.  This is a well written character driven thriller that I can't wait to watch over and over again.  I would highly recommend this if you are a fan of the crime genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie follows a young man (I don't know his name) who is trying to help his father. His father has been diagnosed as bipolar and is a good man. His problems are more personal than political. He has no wife and he needs someone to take care of him in a long, strange trip that takes place on a train. The movie is good. Not really a bad movie but it was a bit slow at times. The writing is ok and the soundtrack is good but a bit disappointing at times with the background music being so loud. The acting is good as well as the editing of the movie. If you like movies that are a little bit slower and a bit darker than a lot of the movies out there. This should be for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Don't bother."   It was a movie about a little girl who lived in a fairy tale house in the woods and had a magical dog to help her. She was an excellent young actress who was the favorite of the town's fairy godmother.   She was also a good friend of the older girl who had an awful disease. It was an old man who ran the house and would punish anyone who had done anything that displeased him or the town.  "I don't know what you did to me, but I know what I did to you!"   The old man didn't know how to work the house or cook.  The dog, he believed, helped him and protected him.  But his daughter could see the evil around him and she tried to destroy it.  I thought it was a nice and sweet story with a bit of a fairy-tale feel.  For the record, a friend of mine, a woman, saw the movie after seeing a little one in it for a school play and wrote a letter to her friends about it. Her first letter said, "I thought the story was sweet. I would like to give it a try for myself.    I don't believe the dog was a good character.  It is so hard to believe that an old person is so cruel, so selfish, and just so mean."  This is how she responded to the story.  This one-night-show was not a good night for me, although I did think that it was pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't like this movie, it was awful.   The movie is a remake of the popular horror movie (a remake) but there were not any blood, and no guts or gore.  I never liked this horror movies, but I think the movie was made for a little kid, like me, that likes horror movies and stuff.  And the movie is supposed to be a story of a kid that wants to go to the Halloween party but there are some scary clowns, the guy that goes with him is mean and bad, and the girl that's with him, is the best part of the movie, she is really cute.  But I really disliked the movie and if you like a movie that's horror and stuff, then you will probably like it.

This is an action packed, no nonsense, good fun.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film about the same time that I saw the classic "Citizen Kane." They're very similar stories that involve a big man who is an asshole. Both are also about an abusive father. Both films were made a long time ago and I just found it funny. I also found it interesting that the wife, in one, talks to her lover in a different accent, like it's a different country.   The sound quality is good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Pierrot le Fou" (1941) is a wonderful animated movie that is about a French cartoonist who makes his first attempt to enter the Paris fashion world with a show that is a bit weird and absurd but it has a good cast of characters that makes it worth the watch.   The animation in this movie is very beautiful and this cartoonist is a very funny guy who has a sense of humor that would make any movie lover very happy.  This movie has a few good laugh lines but this is not a movie that will make you laugh until you cry.  The music is excellent as well and really sets a mood in the movie as the music really matches the mood of the movie in a very satisfying way.

The film has been described as a mix between 'Punch-Drunk Love' and 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', and that's what I see. The characters are charming and loveable, and they seem to do everything they can to make it through to their wedding day.   The film does not stray from the straight and narrow path, but there are a couple of scenes that are quite touching, and some of the performances were quite good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun family film! It has a fun story, and a fun cast with all of their quirks and characteristics, but it isn't the best family film, it isn´t.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a real treat for me. It reminded me a little bit of 'The French Connection' and 'The Outlaw Josey Wales'.   Like the previous two, there was a lot going on, and a lot of people working hard. I didn't really notice the sex. I think it was mainly to draw the audience in, or at least keep them interested. The movie did get a bit confusing at times. I mean, you have these beautiful people running around in heels with big boobs.   I didn´t get it either, but I guess you can`t please everyone. The acting was very good. I liked some of the characters a little more than others. Most notably, I thought it was a bit unfair that the guys didn´ t get to try the new product on. I wish they could have made a few more guys try it. It would have been nice.

The only difference was that they didn't have their junk out and were looking straight at the camera.

This is a very funny movie to watch and very entertaining to hear the old timer talk about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie when I was about 8 or 9 years old and this is a really good movie I must say     The film opens up with a montage of some famous film directors giving their views of life. The first scene shows Hitchcock saying the following about the movies: " Movies are more than mere amusements. They have to have a meaning. But you are free to interpret it any way you like. You get a bit more than a simple story. You can interpret it in a way that you like best. You could say, in this case, that we've been treated to the story of the search for a beautiful young girl in the middle of a desert. She is a little girl, with long dark hair, with a beautiful face, but she is not a virgin. She has been sold into a brothel for three years, but is able to resist for a little while. It is not easy and she needs a big help. Her first step is to find out why the brothel is a bad place. The story is, as usual, very simple but there is a twist: a woman comes to the rescue." Hitchcock then goes on to talk about how he thinks life should be. He says: "Life is too beautiful not to be treated with passion and joy. Life is a beautiful, delicate, complex thing. It should be treated as such. I think the films that have been made are very beautiful. If I don't do a picture, I will do one. I won't waste my time on a cheap story, I'll do a beautiful picture. I don t know what I'll make next but I'm certain I'll have more fun." The film ends with a short montage which shows what life would be like in a different place: " In England, it would be very different from what I see here. It would be a country full of people who are very nice and loving. Everyone would be really nice and happy. People here don t understand that." The next scene opens up in a desert and we see a large stone carving of a woman, with the name Mary and the letters M. S. in the sand. A woman is seen wandering up a sand dune. The woman is very beautiful and the sound of her voice and movement is very attractive. We are shown the woman's movements and how she moves her head to look back at us. As she walks up the dune, she sees a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that is quite good in general. The movie is about a man who lost his way, and his son is his only friend who has grown up in the wilderness. The two friends are about to go back to the world. They meet a girl called Rachael who is a beautiful girl who is looking for her lost brother. One of the friends who are looking for the brother have to go to a place where all the people have died of starvation. When they get there, they get a message from a man in a coffin. This man says "If you find me, I am here to tell you the truth, but you mustn't kill him." This man is actually dead. The men try to find a way to rescue him, but there are no more options. The man tells them the truth about the boy who is living in the woods. He tells the men that there is a lot of magic that the boy can do and that they must all find the boy. The other men believe him because he is a good friend and one of them who is also his son. When the two men go to the boy's house, the boy is very angry with them because they have not brought him food. The boy says he is not afraid to go through with the plan. They do it, and find a tree. The tree is able to create a magical force to protect them. But then it grows big and is able eat the two friends. When it is too big for the two heroes to handle, they leave the tree and the boy and go to where they can hide. The father is able, by taking some money from the boys' money bag, to buy a dog, and take it with him into the forest. The next morning, the dog is gone and the father is going to follow his son in search of his dog. But the boy tells him that he is in a forest, that there are dead trees everywhere and that no one will find him. In a forest with a boy who can make trees grow, a dog who has no real purpose and who can not find his family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you think of a film that follows the exploits of a mercenary group in the middle ages, you probably don't think of something so much as a gritty drama about the consequences of warfare.   In fact, the whole film is more akin to a modern war movie than it is anything else.  But in all fairness, there is a lot more going on than is immediately apparent.  The film begins with the group of mercenaries (called the Black Company in the film) and their leader, Aran (Sébastien Toguera), getting ambushed and killed in the countryside, and being left for dead, until the next morning, when they are found by some farmers.  They are taken to a large castle (actually a castle-in-the-woods, which is an obvious nod to the films The Longest Yard, and is a fairly significant setting of the story).  The two groups are taken together to a military hospital, where both groups of mercenaries are treated. Aran and a few of the other soldiers are allowed to remain in the hospital, but the Black company is to be segregated to a barracks.  It is here that the film shifts into more serious and more realistic territory.  Aran has a strange and strange sort of "magic" that allows him to heal himself, even from wounds he has received from others.  In addition, his band of mercenaries, who have all been killed, come back to life from deadness.  Their commander, Karel, is an old friend of Aran's, and his personality and the relationships he forms with the other characters are intriguing.  Karel's daughter, Zlatan, is played by the beautiful Céline Sciamma, and as she is an only child, the two are very much like a father and son, though Aran is a much more mature character in the picture.  This is also where the film starts to show a different sort of conflict between the different mercenary groups, as the Black group is made up of soldiers of the lowest order, and the rest of the mercenaries are mostly middle-class soldiers, or at least they have come to rely on and benefit from their services.  At one point, the Black Group is led by a young captain, and he is the sort of person who is more concerned about money than anything else, and doesn't mind getting his hands dirty.  While this is a good sort of military leader,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the movies.   So I thought I would see the film and was very disappointed.  The film was all about a man that wanted to marry a girl that he met on a job. He met a woman that he had met on the job.  It turns out she is pregnant but he did not want to get a divorce.  He felt that the woman was to take care of everything so that the baby could be a good one.  I saw the film twice and I was disappointed with the third time.  This is a very interesting idea but the idea is too big to handle.  My biggest problem is that I feel that the man in this movie did not have much to offer.  Why do the men in this world think that they can do everything?  He went out and had the most amazing love story.  At the beginning he was mad at the woman for not having the baby and for not taking care of him.  Then he was happy for the child and for the woman.  So if a man loves a woman why does he not just leave her and go have the baby.  That is the real story. There is a lot to do with the woman that the father does not like and to put the child to bed so that there could not be any more drama.  His problems begin in the beginning when the woman finds out about him being in love with her.  She does not want him to take her.   I can only imagine her feelings for him and how he could not understand her feelings.  We have two men in love but in this case it is not a love story but a relationship.  These are the facts.  When I started watching the film I was amazed at how much the men thought about this woman and the child.  They thought so much about this girl and the children.  You could feel that they loved her. I felt so bad for them.  For the first half of the film we see this girl.  In the beginning her life is as simple as can be. She works.  But in the second half of this film she begins to think about other things.  Her husband, his friends, and her children.   After she starts thinking she falls in love.  All of her emotions come out.  There was a woman in this film that I loved.  To me the character of this woman was the best one.   Her love

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you open your front door at the end of a rainy day, you see a large, black, gray car pull up next to your house. As you turn to look out your window, you notice a huge storm forming on the horizon. The car pulls up in front of your house and then accelerates to such speed that the front end skids around the corner of the street, smashing into a tree. The driver hops out, wearing a white shirt and carrying a big, black umbrella. As he walks up the sidewalk toward the house, he stops in front, grabs the big umbrella and then begins to toss it. It sails through the window of the house and falls onto the roof. A few seconds later, a small child with blonde curly hair, wearing blue jeans, a white button up shirt, a black rain jacket and a purple rain hat walks across the street and then walks into your front yard. The little girl runs over to the rain umbrella, climbs up in the umbrella and holds it out toward the little boy. "Mama, I have to go to the doctor." "Are you sick or sick?" she says, holding out the umbrella. "Yes, Mama, I am sick," says the boy, and begins to run out of the home. As the girl runs across the driveway, a man in a white raincoat, holding a large umbrella, walks into the house with a child in his arms. The man pulls out a small, silver pen and begins looking at the little girl. "Is she your daughter? Is she sick?" "No, Mama." "Well, you better take her to the hospital right now," he says. He walks out of his house and into his car. A moment later, the car accelerates onto the road. The vehicle then slams into a big brick wall at a very high rate of speed and explodes. People scream and run out. The woman in the rain jacket is lying flat on her back, the umbrellas are scattered across the pavement and her body is wrapped in a wet white sheet. A child runs over and picks up a small umbrella and a pen. Then a little boy runs over with his hat on backwards, carrying a small yellow umbrella. He stands there holding the umbrella up over his head, looking at his mother's corpse in the blackness. When the child turns to go back into his house, the man in the white rain coat jumps out of a second-story window and grabs
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that I am looking forward to see:  Like I said, a lot of what I enjoy is in the details.  There are a few parts that I think that could have been better if not for the "weird" people that we see.  However, overall, I like it!   Watch it at work, for your morning walk, or on a night out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got my hands on the Blu-Ray release of The Last Samurai and it has great visuals, a wonderful score, and a great performance from the two lead actors.   The story has a similar tone to the recent samurai movie I saw, The Magnificent Seven (which I think is better than the first movie I watched), where it is about the samurai fighting back against an enemy force and then in a series of battles the samurai gain their freedom and decide to live as free men and live the good life.  As the movie opens, the samurai are on a fishing expedition and this is where I started to really like the film.  I love the idea that the samurai would spend their time fishing.  In this opening scene, we see the samurai fishing in a beautiful landscape, where we can see that the water is clean.  The scene was shot in a style that reminded me a bit of the samurai movies from the 60s.  There is a great sense of depth and movement in the film and the music is excellent.  At the same time, we are given a great introduction to the characters, especially with the father and the son.  This is especially true for the father, who is played by the great Sean Connery, and the main antagonist, General Ushijima, played by Toshiro Mifune.  Once again, this film has great action scenes, but also a story that is quite touching.  It is a film that could be good for the whole family and there is enough in it for a good time.  If you enjoyed any of the movies I reviewed from this summer, then I'd recommend The Last, Samurai and I'll Tell You My Secret as well.  What did you think of the film?  Was it good?  Did you enjoy it as much as I did? Leave a comment below!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't believe this movie.   It's not a great movie. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen.  It was an excuse for a bad movie to come out.  This movie is so stupid it makes me wish I'd never gotten a computer in the first place.  First of all, there's a young couple in a car driving down the freeway on their way to a party.  They get into a fight and the girl goes flying across the highway.  She hits a tree and a bird is killed.  As she is getting up, she sees a car pull up.  The couple drives off and then they see a car pulling up. A man walks out of the car and looks at the girl.  "I see a little girl" he says.  And this man is about my age.  He gets in the car with the girl and they drive off.  Eventually, he pulls into a restaurant and the couple ask him to get a burger.  But they have no money.  What they don't realize is that there's no burger at the restaurant.  Anyway, they go inside and the guy orders a hamburger.  While they are waiting for the food, the girl tells him he looks really nice.  Once the food comes, the guy says, "Oh, I look good!"  And the girl replies, "Yeah, right!  I'm fat!"  They all go back out the restaurant and wait for the rest of the family to come back.  Then the girl comes in and says,  "You look really nice, man.  Do you have a wife?"  The man says,? No. ? What? ? I have a beautiful wife.  When the boy asks about a wife, the man says he's got a wife. The girl gets mad. "Don't lie!  That's bullshit!"  The boy tells her it's all a big joke and that he doesn't have a girl. The guy comes back.   " I've got a beautiful girl"  So the guy sits down next to the girl at the table and starts talking to her.  Finally the girl is convinced.  After he asks her out to the movie, she says yes.  I got so bored of the movie it was hard to continue.  One of the funniest scenes in the movie involves a man's wife who doesn't know he has a

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first part of the film takes place in a small town.    This small town is dominated by the two families that reside in it.  The main characters, Micky and Johnny, are young men and are struggling to make a living as they grow up.    Both Micky's parents, the patriarch and the mother are in a relationship of sorts and have been for years.  The father is a very religious man and doesn't see his sons as equals.  His wife and daughter are very close to him and have never really gotten along.  Micky is a big, burly, bully who looks like a stereotypical American.  He works in construction and can't seem to get a break from the harsh work conditions.  Johnny is the younger brother and is a more well adjusted boy who is always well dressed and in good sports.  They live together in a modest home but have been separated for many years.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's title is actually a clever pun, and a clever one at that! The plot, which I won't bother trying to summarize, is that a man discovers that his wife and a friend were murdered by a gang of hoodlums. The man is reluctant to believe that the killers would do such a thing, but eventually he has to face this horrible revelation. The plot's twists and turns are so ingenious that you feel like you're watching a comedy movie instead of a serious one, even though there is a good deal of tragedy. Even the soundtrack is funny.   One of the more subtle but wonderful scenes occurs during the first time the woman is seen wearing a tight red dress, which has a pretty large opening that reveals her ample cleavage. She has a very seductive air about her and it's really nice to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this film my heart started racing. I saw it in a theatre in Los Angeles on the 13th of October 2013. I watched this in a late night time slot on a Saturday. It was a very entertaining and fast moving film, and I thought the film was a real eye opener.   One of the major highlights of the film for me was the portrayal of the characters, from the lead character, to the characters he had at his disposal. The way they are portrayed was very original and original and I felt the need to see the film again after the screening to really appreciate the film and to get to know the characters better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can't really deny the strength that this movie is shown to possess: the sheer number of deaths, the depth of the characters, the overall beauty of the story, the great performances, the beautiful effects. It's all quite stunning, isn't it?   I think that most people who read the book will not enjoy this one. It is more like a 'how to use an M-16' movie than a real war movie. It shows off all the military hardware and vehicles but it never really demonstrates how to use them effectively in real life. I suppose it could have been very useful if the story had been told in the way the book was told, in the format of an episode of a TV show. The movie starts with a battle, a sort of parade of the military equipment (the tanks and guns are in two separate battleships) and it does not really show how to put them to use.   At first the soldiers are pretty much ineffectual. You only get to see them when the tank is hit or when some of the enemy are shot down. They never seem to understand how to move through the mud or how to set up fire. As I said earlier, they are ineffectuality is very apparent. But it isn't all bad: the special effects are superb and the acting is pretty good.  The movie is actually quite funny in spots.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent movie, which makes me want to do a little better with my life. The first half of the movie is very well done, with the good actors doing good and interesting jobs. But then comes the final act, with all the different plot twists that add up to make the movie a little unbelievable.   One of the best action scenes in an action movie.  " I like the idea of " The Godfather " - but the whole film makes me ill. I mean, I liked it and I was satisfied with the ending, but when I got to the "I'm gonna die!" scene - that was just unbelievable. I was laughing at this guy...and this was in a movie that I thought was very well made.  It is true that the main character in this movie is not a very sympathetic or likable person - and I can see why the directors decided not to kill him off so early on in the movie - but it does not take away from the good stuff that the film does have to offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, let me give this movie a good review. It's not too long, so there is no need to re-watch, but if you don't like comedies and the like then I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good stories that are well told.   This movie is about a family that is living in a small town. They're a bit odd. One sister is a freak, one sister is sick (they call her a 'lady'), one sister has an annoying brother who lives with her and has no friends and is on the dole every month. A big surprise comes to them one day. One of the women decides to move to a distant town, because the family is old and she wants to be close to them. Her name is Maria and her older sister, Claudia, who has just lost her job is about to move with her. Claudia is worried about her and her sister and takes the job of a receptionist to earn more money. Her friend Maria, who lives in the town, tells her a story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched The Girl on the Train in which a woman, who lost her husband and son in a plane crash, decides to drive from New York to San Francisco with her new best friend. However, on the way she gets separated from her friend and she soon runs into some troubles: her husband was a member of a gang, the gang is planning to assassinate her, the daughter of her new friend is pregnant and is being treated by a doctor whom is not well-informed about the case.   One of the main characters, a man named John, the friend's father, tries to talk the gang into letting her off, but all his efforts are in vain: John gets a bad back and is in constant pain.  At the beginning of the movie a young woman, the wife of a wealthy family, decides she wants to become an actress.  The film tells its story in a relatively simple manner: a character, a woman named Lizzie, has a bad case of insomnia, and falls asleep to a film clip. This makes her dream a long dream. This dream eventually takes the form of a woman called Alice, who, in a beautiful, dream-like manner, makes some dramatic comments about her life, and that leads to her falling asleep again to a third film clip in which Alice's character, the actress Lucy, makes a declaration that she intends to make her husband, a millionaire, her "husband."  The Girl   In a few scenes we see a series of dreams Lizzy has which all lead to her being seduced by Lucy, and the ending is that she marries the wealthy John and is given a large dowry.  A character who looks like an actress who plays a good role, Lucy is only an illusion: she is only a person who seems to be a very successful actress, but in reality has only a small part to play and has a very small fortune.  She is at first very attracted to Lizz to whom she has very little, but after she has fallen into a state of intoxication, she has a dream in which she falls in love with her, and she wants Lucy to stay with her because she loves Lizz so much.  However, Lucy refuses to go and John, who is a member (if not the leader) of the gang, murders Lizz. John, a gang member who has been seduced (or possibly raped) by Alice, has now become a criminal and is a

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was the second installment in a series that was originally released in the 70's. I have seen the original on VHS and thought it was a cool movie about a detective solving crimes with the help of his old cop friend. My wife and I both enjoyed this movie. I liked the way the story unfolded with a slow pace. The way he solved the case, the voice acting and the suspense was great. The two cops were funny and the way they were interacting with each other made the movie enjoyable to watch. I was hoping for more action from the movie but it did not disappoint. It is fun watching a young detective solving a case with his old pal and also enjoying the banter between the two. I am very excited to see the next installment.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching The Exorcist on cable about a year ago.   This movie left a very bad taste in my mouth.  It looked and sounded like a bad movie from the 70's.  I didn't like how the demon possessed a little girl, how he used his penis to rape the little girl and his mom.  They could of shot the demon off by using a shotgun or a machine gun.  Instead they made it look like a bunch of guys with swords fighting.  How they killed off the little girls mother with the sword was a little silly.  The way they killed the father was just dumb.  If there is any justice in this world there will be a sequel.  My only real problem is it didn't have the budget to make it great.  But that's a small price to pay.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoyed the movie you will like the book.   The story takes place on a planet where one of the two main characters, Jack (Dylan Baker) lives.  Jack is a boy who loves life and being with his sister and his mom.  One day Jack is going to a science class.  They are talking about the things that will happen in the future and Jack notices that they are talking too much about the events that have happened in the past.  He asks his sister, Ella (Saoirse Ronan) what is the future like?  Ella replies that the future is like a blank slate so when it gets written down on paper there is nothing there.  It is like the future was made up when the scientists used computers to create a computer to simulate the past events so they can be read and viewed.  So when they say something will happen and then nothing happens there is no future.  There was a time in the near future and the whole world was destroyed.  Ellaa says that this was the time they stopped writing down the events because they didn't want to remember it.  Now they write down their memories and the memories get put on an computer and put into a computer so we can watch them come to life on a computer screen.  We also hear from Ellaa about the world that was created from the computer.  In the future the computers can do things and there was a race between the computers that were created to create the computer that simulated the past and the computers who were created as a result.  But then one day they went crazy because the one who created the world didn't like that they had recreated the past that they created so he sent a team of super beings to destroy the world so he could do something better and create a new computer world that would recreate all of the events in a computer.    So Ellaa explains that there were two sides of the race and the computer was going to wipe out the people that were on one side and then wipe out everyone on the other side so the computer would get everything.  However the computers created two super beings and they had the computer to make sure that everyone was on the same side.  The two super men were trying to create worlds and the humans were trying not to destroy themselves.  After a long time the super men ran out of energy and the super beings needed to die so they came back to life.  And Ell

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My father always wanted me to grow up to be an architect but I always wanted to be a doctor, and as a kid I did, in fact, make some buildings. One of my favorite buildings in the world is the One World Trade Center (I live in that building). It was always very beautiful and my dad always talked about it when we were out walking. I would have been 12 years old if not for the terrorists.     My dad, a great man, died in 2010.  When the terrorists hit the World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001, I knew I needed to find out how to build a building that would withstand a major crash.  To build something that could survive an enormous plane crash, I looked at the history of how the WTC was designed, and how it had been built.  And this is a true story, although my parents were not directly involved, and my story is a little different than theirs.  I spent a good bit of time researching how to create a structure to withstand a plane crash in the same way as the WTC had been designed, but I was only able to get a vague idea of what the building looked like before they started putting in the fire walls.  The next step was to find a model of the building to see how the building had been constructed.  It took months for my father to die and I had no one in my corner.  Even though I didn't see a model before, I felt that I could still do a good job making the building the way I wanted.  In the process of trying to make the tower the way that I wanted it, I did build a section of the wall that I felt should be there. I also built a couple of floors for the lower floors, but my dad was dead before we could put these in.  At one point during the research I did some research on the structure that the WTC did.  With all the effort I put into making the towers the way they were built, I was starting to wonder if I could get it up.  Unfortunately, after I put in all the columns, I discovered that the whole thing fell down.  Thankfully, nobody died in that thing.  So, in the end, I built the building that I always saw in my father's memory.  After my father passed away, I took over building the World trade Center for a few months until my dad could be laid to rest.  If
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this film I couldn't believe how good it was, I was blown away by the special effects, the story, the acting, the atmosphere, the direction, and everything about the movie, I really enjoyed it.   But like I said, I got sick and tired of it after a while.  There was nothing to really say about it other than I loved it for the first 20 minutes and the next 20 minutes it just went downhill.  For example the movie was all about the romance between an alien and an Earth woman (Brenna) and this is pretty much the only thing about the film that I actually liked, the alien and the woman were the perfect couple and they had a nice time in bed together, but then the aliens decide they want to take over the Earth and you have this big action sequence where they take over a city. It's like a sci-fi action film without all the action.  As for the acting I thought they all did a good job, although it was a little bit too much going on in one scene it was not too distracting. The aliens in this movie were pretty cool and I did like the alien who came from a planet where women wear men's clothes.  I liked the alien's clothes and his voice was very alien sounding but the special effect makeup wasn't too good and it was hard to see the alien because the screen was all black and the special FX looked kinda bad.  The alien who was a woman was pretty cool. The alien was very feminine, I liked her.  It was fun watching the aliens try to conquer the Earth, but by the time they did they were just too powerful and they decided they wanted to get out of the Earth.  But I liked everything about this movie, it had great special effects and the sex was good.  This movie is about as bad as the aliens in the last Alien movie, and while I am not really interested in watching movies that have the same bad alien in every movie, this one was a disappointment to me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie so good that it's hard to believe that this is only in theaters today.   In the '70s, the "Warner Brothers" were so successful they were able to get into nearly every genre imaginable with films like "Jaws" and "Aliens."   After the success of those two films, they started making comedies (in between these two, they produced "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" and they were a smash-hit with it).   Their second, "Scooby Doo and Scrappy-Doo", was a smash hit as well and they had a few more hits after that.  In between those, they made some decent action films and a few decent comedies.  By the mid '70's, these were the golden years for the "Wizard of Oz" franchise and a "Batman" film looked like it could be a great success.  Unfortunately, the '80's were the worst period in their film career and by the time "Batman Returns" hit theaters in 1989, they were all but finished.  This is a fun, enjoyable movie and they nailed it.  The voice work is top notch, as are the costumes.  It's not too long, not too short, and it's just fun.  A fantastic movie.  Recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "This is an adventure story with the best of the best in it. It may be too far out to be a "movie" in a conventional sense, but that's not the point of this tale. The director does his best to make an entertaining and enjoyable movie while taking chances where his creativity and sense of humor, in addition to a good story line, make this worthwhile.    The plot may be a bit convoluted, but the story is actually not all that bad. There are elements of comedy and adventure as well as some good scares. It will not win any awards, but it is a good, interesting movie. It's a bit too long for an action movie and is a bit slow in pace, but if you are willing to give it a chance, it's a pretty good movie and worth a viewing.  "

It does a good job of showing us all the different aspects of what is so important to a successful martial artist; self discipline, determination, strength, speed, endurance, and of course; the most important of all, a great attitude.   The movie also portrays a true story that involves some real "bad guys" as well as some real characters that were just so relatable that I never got bored.  I am a bit sad that the movie only had a one shot release; I think there was a possibility that a sequel could have been created. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a wonderful movie. What a delightful film! I always enjoy watching movies that feature music, but this is very different from most music-oriented films. The movie takes a more romantic look at life and the characters. In the film, the film follows the life of a couple of women as they grow and become happier. It doesn't seem like a typical romantic comedy, because I never thought of it that way, but it's quite beautiful and charming. I'm looking forward to watching this again when I finish my next reading!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, I was going to go see this movie at a theater in the West Hollywood area with friends, but I decided against it. I was actually really turned off by the idea of going to this movie. The story was awful, and the script, although being written in the form of an actual film script, was poorly-written in the way that "The Princess Bride" was poorly written, and there were also a few scenes in which the writing seemed to be rushed. I think this is because of the fact that a lot of the film is made up of flashbacks. That's the only thing this movie had going for it, and that really wasn't much. The film was also just really cheap-looking. Not the most appealing-looking movie I've ever seen, but it was a quick movie and I didn't feel like I wasted my time going to see it. This is a good film for the time it was made, and I think it would have been a better film with different actors and with a different director, but unfortunately, it is not up to par with what the movie should have been.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had seen a number of horror movies in the years that followed Halloween. One of my favorite films of that year was The Hills Have Eyes. The movie was made for just over $2 million. As a horror movie, it was pretty good and a worthy effort by director Richard Donner. There was a bit of a camp factor to the movie, so it is not for everyone. In the film, there were several characters. The first was a man who would go around and kill children in order to survive. When he got to a school, he had the opportunity to kill the teacher. It seemed like a typical slasher movie, but that wasn't the case. The film did not have much to do with the slasher films of the day. Instead it was more a film about a school teacher who was not all that it seemed. I like the fact that the school teacher was not the most human being. He just happened to live a very unusual life. The teacher is also a child killer. One day, he has to kill a few children and his girlfriend. Of course, this does not go according to plan. What was a fun film for those of us who loved the horror genre came out to be a dull film that is just plain boring.    This movie had a lot of problems. One thing that bothered me is the lack of horror on the screen. The school was not scary at all. There were lots of people playing cards and drinking coffee. It is as if they could not be bothered to give a single scream. One other thing I noticed was that it was a fairly uneventful movie. It had no suspense, nothing scary, nothing. This is a little odd to me, because it was one of the first horror films I have seen that was good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is pretty clear that the director was trying to be a bit of a rebel in the beginning, but his work was pretty cool after that.   The character of the main character is so complex and interesting, and there is a lot of humour in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very enjoyable movie.   I found it to be a story that would be very entertaining and a good lesson in man's relationship with animals.  They are portrayed with all of the traits that you would think they would have, and they are presented with intelligence, but also with a good sense of humor.  I was a bit disappointed with the ending.  But, as a story about a cat's life, I found this to be very interesting, and I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like good movies. It's a tough business. In this case the bad movie is really good. I love the way it sets the tone, and the way the movie flows, it's a little long but you feel it all throughout the film. I thought it was well worth the time I spent on it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a great comedy! Not only is it a movie about an old man that was born blind, but it also has a gay family that are pretty much identical to the old man. This movie does not have a bad joke. It's like a real movie, and not just a comedy.    A must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The opening was the only part of the movie that took me by surprise.   I'm not a big fan of horror movies (which is why I haven't seen this one yet) but I'll admit this movie is pretty entertaining.  This is not a good one and that's the only reason it got a 4.5.  It's really the only thing about this movie that's good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my view, this is a good film about a hero. I've seen a few good movies lately.   What a good story!   There is a certain movie I like to watch when I'm alone.  The sound is good, the film looks good, and the story is good!  The heroes in this movie are all very different.  All good movies need to have a little hero to look up to. This is one I'll remember!

It is not the kind of movie I would enjoy all of the time, but when I was there it made a deep impression on me. I don't think I have seen a more impressive acting of the movie.   The movie doesn't have a lot of action, but it is entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was able to watch the entire movie (except for a brief portion before the ending credits) in one sitting. In some ways this movie is similar to Jaws, but without all the cheesy laughs. The movie features a great cast of characters that are not only hilarious, but are a blast to watch as well. The pacing of the movie was perfect, with little plot-holes, but never feel rushed.   If you are a horror lover, this is the movie for you!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all good American films (and all good Hollywood movies), The Magnificent Seven is about a gang of cowboys on a train to the Wild West. This train is loaded with dangerous Indians, who attack the train. But then a huge, white, big, good-looking, rich, handsome, American man comes to help the men, and the men help him. And he's a great big good-lookin' American.   He helps the men shoot at Indians and he helps them to get off the train, so they can come home. And then the Indians, after a big fight, attack him and kill him.  And that's all there is to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only negative thing I can say is that this movie is a bit hard to watch. The story is about a woman who falls in love with a mysterious man, who then disappears. She goes looking for him and finds a mysterious woman (the one who is not mysterious) that wants her to get rid of her husband because the husband is a jerk. She tries to do so. Then the movie goes to a new level and a mysterious creature gets in between the two women. When the mysterious creature turns on the women, they realize they have become lovers and the creature is back. This is a very, very good movie and it's definitely worth the rental.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You should definitely see this movie.   It's a story about a young man who is in a coma and his family and friends are searching for a way to get him out.  The only problem is the director didn't follow the story's direction, it doesn't go where he wants it to go.  This movie is a wonderful movie to watch.  We got a very good story about the son in a hospital and his friends.  We get a look into their lives and their relationship.  It may be a bit too long to watch but I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

The acting in this movie is great, and there is a ton of chemistry in it, I really enjoy it.  It also has some great comedy, a great character development, and really enjoyable plot that doesn't waste time getting into it, and yet it is still interesting and well-paced.  For me this is the movie that made me feel like a kid again, playing with toys on the playground, and just seeing how crazy the characters would get, and the situations that were thrown at them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to go to movies with friends so this movie was a great opportunity to show us a couple of nice movies and make us smile.   The movie is pretty much based on a novel of the same name by Robert M. Van Camp and is a movie that is not only entertaining but also very well written with a lot of great characters.  I don't really care for a good romcom but I am a big fan of Robert M Van Camps work.  The film has a very dark, very serious tone and some interesting story lines so I was actually quite pleased with this movie.  After a movie is finished, I think we have a bit of a time for a bit, if you're hungry I guess you can have a snack or a glass of wine and take a nap.      Marlene was an innocent high school student and her life is about to change forever when a group of high school girls decide to prank her and it is then that she realizes the depths to her social life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      This film is probably not the greatest but I think it's good fun.   The plot is basically a bad one:  The movie opens in a prison, and the bad guy, the head of a crime family, is about to be executed.  He's hanging from a noose in a cage in the main prison.  The police come, and while waiting for the executioner to show, he asks the prisoners to go outside.  They do.  Now they're going to meet him.  It's all kind of funny:  They have all this talk about how they'll have a "good time" and the prisoners don't, but they still go ahead with their plan.  At this point in the movie, you don't care.  There are some great little gags in it:  One prisoner is about a foot shorter than his big brother, the other has a real bad skin problem, and a prisoner, who we see from a distance and is a little taller, is a total idiot.  (He keeps saying "Look at my big brother!" or some such.  That's hilarious, especially in a movie that's about a prison.)   Another thing that's really funny is the prisoner who's got a "B.O.B." (bad back).  The guards have to break it up.  But even if they break it, the guy is still going to get his head chopped off, and he does.  One last thing that might be funny is that when the prisoner goes down to get the head chopped of his brother, he's got to go down first, and so he goes back up, but he has to get out, and all the guards are standing around watching him...   A good, not great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts off pretty well with some good banter between the two.   As soon as we see the villain it's pretty clear that this will be a very dark and dramatic film.  The movie then moves to the middle of the film when we see a young boy, who is apparently possessed by a ghost.  We then get some pretty intense and interesting shots of ghost images being seen on the screen.  And then it's the good ole "happy" ending which is one of the highlights of the movie.  A good blend of humor and dark atmosphere and a good performance by the young actor.  I really enjoyed this movie and it would have been a nice Halloween movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good   This movie is a remake of an old American TV show about a guy named Dave who lives with his uncle.   There's no dialog and a whole lot of "the other guy" action and weird humor.  And the weird stuff is very funny.  It's not like you've ever seen a big, hairy man who lives in a tree (except for the guy who's an iguana).  The jokes are a little "off."   What's missing   None of the actors in this are any good.  They're all just trying to get laughs at your expense.  The bad   It has a "wanted poster" for the actor of the title.  In the background, you can see a small white person.  So you think maybe it's Dave who's trying to take a woman for the day and is really a creepy old man? But no.  We get a really odd scene where the old man says things like "I'll have another" to which the woman says, "What?  What are you going to do for lunch?"   I think if you want an old movie with a strange premise that isn't funny, watch "The Thing".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think my first exposure to the movie "I Love You Phillip Morris" was during the film festival in London where the director, Stephen Frears, gave a special screening for "Ginger", the star of the film.   As soon as I saw the film, I was hooked!   This movie is truly one of the most memorable comedies I have ever seen.  Although the film is based on a true story, it is more of a story about a couple, Phil and Lucy, who run a bar/pub.  For some strange reason, they end up with a son, Philip Morris.  Phillip is a very naive child, who knows very little about the world around him and is full of questions.  Philip and his father, however, do not seem to share in this naivety and Phil is always complaining about the way he and Lucy are raising their son. Lucy in turn blames Philip for the fact that she is never satisfied with her life. The main reason for this is because Philip is constantly being bullied by his school mates and Lucy doesn't seem to be very popular either.  The relationship between Philip and Lucy has a lot of problems.  Initially, they seem to like each other very much and both are very happy, but Philip seems to always want to do the wrong thing.  Eventually, he gets into so much trouble at school that they are forced to separate.  Finally, Phil is bullied so much that he kills himself.  I enjoyed the movie very much.  It's a comedy about a little boy and his big brother who are not exactly friends. They are, however both very much in love with each other. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This is the kind of movie that makes you think; this one gets you in its stride right from the start. You feel like a kid in a candy store with a bunch of kids running around with a giant, colorful, colorful cast of characters to throw at the wall, and you'll laugh at them all. And if you don't laugh, well, you're a pretty bad person.   "This movie has a great amount of humor in it and the animation is great. I especially like how the characters are designed for each other; it makes them feel like family rather than just the usual crowd of characters you see in these movies.  "The song 'A Man and His Dog' by John Denver is a pretty good one too.  I was pretty impressed with this movie too!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of this movie, in the best sense is amazing. I have a few words for the author, that is why it is so good. The author is very good at writing a good story.   But, what is so great about the story is, that the characters are very interesting. The best part of the movie is when the characters first meet and have a talk. I could not explain this movie.  This movie has a very great sense of humor. I would not recommend this movie to a young people or to the people with a weak heart. It is not a good film to see, I recommend it to those who love horror movies and a good fantasy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to see this movie, I had to re-watch the series and watch it again to realize what was different about it. The plot was still a little strange, but at least it made more sense this time around and even ended up a little more epic than in the original series. Overall, it didn't blow me away, but I could understand why it got popular. I would love to see the entire series in this movie format, and the only thing that I didn't like about it is that it's still a lot of walking.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm in love with it.   "The Hunger" is a brilliant story about a mother who is raising two kids in poverty by cooking what little she can and praying that the world will change before their mother passes on.  I just can't put the same level of passion for a story that I do for other people's movies, especially when it's written by someone as talented as Andrew Jarecki (the same guy who made The Jinx) and directed by an accomplished filmmaker like Peter Berg (who won a Peabody for his direction on True Detective).   There's an important message at the heart of this movie.  This woman is no saint.  Her husband is a drunk and a lazy scumbag.  When he's not busy sleeping with her daughters, he's busy killing people and committing bank robberies.  She is doing all that with her head held high and with a smile on her face.  The two daughters are her pride and joy, but she can't raise them all on her own.  So, she asks her son to do everything for her and help out with the children when the other men in the household can't.  And when he can't, he tells them how to cook and clean and clean the house.  We love this woman because we want to show her up.  It's easy to hate a person that can't be happy and can't cook.  It's easy, too, to think that these women are just lazy, and in need of a good man to make them happy.  But we don't know the whole story.  That's why it's so beautiful to see her get back to basics and go back to the basics.  In this movie, we learn that you can survive on the little scraps of food and the kindness of strangers.  You can make the best of a bad situation and work hard.  Even if your kids are sick, sick with the flu, sick at school or sick with a disease that's out there, you can find a way to make a life for yourself.  This is what my life looked like when I was a kid: If you're in need (or want to be) of a life story and you'd like to hear it from a woman, read this   This movie is more than just a story about poverty.  My mom is a survivor of the Holocaust and she lived on a small island off

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film doesn't have a specific theme or genre so it is basically an action movie about people who do a lot of bad and bad things. The movie had a good story line about a very strange person who works in a building with an evil guy, it had a lot to say about people in the building and how they all have some sort of connection with each other that is strange, but I don't remember too much about it. All in all it was a fun action movie that had some laughs to it and I would recommend it to any action movie fan out there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot: When a man wakes up with a wife and child he has no idea what's going on. What he does know is that the police are after him for murder, and that this wife and kid, no older than three, are very sweet. I think the main problem the plot had was that it never had any resolution. The main conflict comes down to a woman who seems to like the husband, but can't stand the child, and a man who can't live without his wife. As with most comedies there is plenty of sex, and an almost-sex scene with a woman, but nothing that really matters. Also as with most comedy the comedy has no emotional content. It's a little weird, a little crude, and not always a good sign, but it's mostly good. It will probably appeal to people who like the kind of thing we get in the movies about small-town families, especially if they're a little tired of the modern family movies and/or they just want a laugh.   I recommend it to anyone looking for a good, inexpensive comedy and a nice family drama. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there is a good bad movie in this world, it's definitely The Rocketeer! The film is actually the sequel to the 1982 cult classic,  Rocketeers, in which Sylvester Stallone returns in a much larger role and, for the first time, as a bad guy.  In the sequel, Stallone has a good time with the cast of young and beautiful young women at the beach, but soon realizes that he has to start being more careful with his actions.   Unfortunately, the film has some bad acting and cheesy jokes, and the screenplay is not very good, with its bad pacing and the fact that we have some very annoying characters.  This film has a few moments of humour, and even a few good lines, which are good, but it doesn't make up for the poor performances and the bad script.  I recommend this film, and I would not recommend the sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a big fan of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and this movie does a great job of capturing all of the emotions. There is some good comedy but nothing as funny as the original. As the movie moves along, we are treated to some more beautiful shots that show that this movie was made to be seen by a wide audience and not just the small group of people that have seen it.   It is one of the best things I have ever seen, a movie that is true to the original and a very funny time to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is absolutely brilliant, from start to finish! As you could see from the poster, the movie stars a young man (who plays a bad guy) who wants to do something he cannot do; he has a dream where he is a hero and he can be a good guy to everyone he meets and to everyone else he has lost all hope and is ready to go to hell. So when he is confronted by a police officer he says "I can be whatever you want me to be, I will be a bad dude all day long!" and he gets an honest, hard lesson about the consequences of his actions. I can not say anything more good about this movie! I cannot imagine how bad a police movie should be but I think this movie is the best yet!

It's pretty good and very original. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure where I'm supposed to start with this review, so let me just say that this is one of those movies that is like watching a train wreck. I can't say that I was terribly surprised by this movie, but there are things about it that I can criticize. First of all, the acting was a little off. The actors had no idea how to play the role of the two cops who are investigating the kidnapping and murder of a couple. The story itself wasn't much to write home about, though. They basically just followed the leads and ended up at a car wash. I thought that was a pretty lame ending to a bad movie.   I'm surprised that anyone even liked this movie. It's basically a trainwreck.  So I've been telling everyone that this was a bad film, and I had a hard time believing it when it came out.  I've read some of the other negative reviews about it, but I think that a lot of them were written from a place of jealousy or a lack of understanding of the movie. As far as it being bad, I don't know, I just don't see why someone would waste their time seeing this movie if they don't have something good to get out of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got a great deal on this movie. The cast and crew did an amazing job with this movie, and I am grateful. The script is good, the movie's pretty good as well. The ending is a little weird, but still kinda sweet.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is an original comedy movie, and there are many jokes in it. And there are funny scenes in it too. But it is about two brothers who hate each other, so much so that their mother makes a life-size dummy and sends the two of them into a fantasy world. The two brothers are the only things that live in this world and fight against their enemies by putting them in a cage and then throwing them into the lake of fire. It is a wonderful comedy, and if you like funny, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched The Last Man on Earth recently on DVD.  I have a feeling that it is about as good a film as you can get.   My favorite part about the movie is the ending.  The last man on earth was an evil monster.  It was a long shot at the time but when it was done it was well done and I have never felt so happy as I did at that moment.  When the last man is on earth the people who were in the bunker were given an opportunity to run from this evil creature.  One of the people ran to the mountains.  All of the survivors are now living in the mountain.  There is only one person in the world who is the last living man.  He is known as the last real man.     A couple of days after the movie was over the last person who ever lived was born.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:        This is a wonderful film! It is set in the early 1900s in the small community of Salem Massachusetts. It is a small time town of just over 100 people that have all seen an odd and terrifying experience. There are no ghosts or monsters in this movie. It only depicts a man who has been in a life time of suffering. His name is Edward Keatley who is a farmer and has been forced to leave his farm and move to another one in the woods. He does not want to move and believes that his soul is still trapped in the land of the dead. One night he is in a small church when a young man, named Robert Keaton, appears. Keatye does not have a soul. He is just a man in the world. Robert tells him that there are no spirits or monsters around and they will both go to the same place together. Robert then turns to Edward Keaton and asks for his soul. The two take off in a horse and buggy and begin a journey to a land that has never been known to man. They do not know what is there. After a while the horse breaks down and they are forced to walk back to the church on foot. There Robert does not die and Edward does not return to his old farm.   He does however have an accident which leaves him a quadriplegic.  There is a beautiful old lady, Mary, who is also a quadriliogic. She comes up and introduces herself to Edward and tells him of the old story of the boy and the horse. She also says that she will keep the boy alive so that he may die a peaceful death.  The boy has never known anything but pain and suffering and has a very strange look in his eye. He tells Edward that he has to be brave and go along with Robert.  Robert then starts to cry and says that he can't leave the boy. Edward is very upset at this.  They both travel back to their old farm to look for Keatleys soul. They find it in a tomb. Edward then goes down and starts to pray. His prayer does not work. There is no afterlife. Keato is too broken to understand what is going on.  He is about to be taken to the tomb when a great explosion goes off. The townspeople, who are all of Salem's older people, are blown up and killed. Keats soul survives and is trapped by a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As for the movie itself, I would say it is very good. The movie is very interesting and the scenes are pretty well choreographed. The acting is pretty good. I also liked the music. The story is good too. The main character is very likable, especially the character who is very honest and straightforward. The romance is cute and sweet. I would recommend this movie to all fans of science fiction and a good romance.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - A great movie! - The music in the film is so beautiful!   The film is about a group of scientists and people living together on an alien planet. They live in a large city with a high-rise building. The movie has no real plot, yet it is a good comedy and a great love story. The film has an interesting storyline as well.   I recommend this movie to those who are in love with a certain movie and are willing to watch something bad and not want to know the story, just because it is "the movie".   A great movie: The music and sound are great in this movie.  The acting is good but not great.  I highly recommend this film for people who are seeking a good laugh and who want to watch a love story that is really funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A bit of a twist in a very ordinary story of a man, a woman and their dog in a sleepy, seaside town who have to travel through the night. This is a fairly interesting idea and with a little more action this could have been really great.   An unusual and good film with a well-made ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this on a Saturday evening at my local theater with two other friends who came out of the screening feeling really bad for the characters, the director and the actress. There were so many bad jokes in this movie I had trouble concentrating on the plot. I could almost hear the people laughing in the theater. I would never be able to enjoy this movie again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good flick for the entire family. It was well done, a lot of fun, a nice little movie to watch over the holidays or on a summer vacation.   If there is a good one out there that's not a horror movie they sure should make more of them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see "Gone With The Wind" (the original 1939 version with its great songs) at a theater near me. I bought the tickets at a time when a film like that could not be found anymore, so there was a lot of anticipation, I thought, the movie was a classic, and it was a success. I am not one for melodrama or melodramas, so I did not know what to expect. The first half is like a typical sentimental movie. A man falls in love and falls asleep, the girls and the men dance around him, and he doesn't really see anything wrong with it. Then, the man wakes up and goes back home. He finds that his house is empty. He goes to the front door and there is a new face, one of the maids, and the girl with the dog. The maid sees him, too, and is a little annoyed with him. The man has the feeling that she doesn't want him anymore. The old man comes home and tells his son about the girl, and then the old man and the young man play a game that seems to be a very popular one in a country where people are supposed to be in bed by six in the evening, so the boy decides to go out and play. The two old men go out in a boat and sail out to sea, and a woman who is a sea-woman, sees the boat, thinks it is a big fishing boat, and runs to warn the young men, but they run into a big storm and lose her. The woman gets to the young people and tells them that she is going to rescue them. The young men are very happy at the thought that she would rescue them from the storm and that they wouldn't be lost on the sea. The movie ends with the two old man at the same time on either side of the boat in the boat.   When I saw the movie, I did have a good feeling about it, and I was glad that it had been so successful in the 1930's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well this movie is an American movie set in the 1950's. It's about a young man (Richard Harris) who goes into the South to get his girlfriend and father back from the war. I really like this movie and it has a bit of humor which isn't often found in the old films. I've heard it was made by the famous director Francis Ford Coppola, and it was a big box office success. I can remember it being about the time the South became a bit more conservative and the white people started to disappear. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not for everyone. It is about a young girl that is being raised by her single mother in an all white rural town in Pennsylvania. She doesn't like to leave her bed and when she does, she finds an old broken down doll. The girl loves it and they spend their time playing together, often to the accompaniment of a piano. Eventually the doll gets bigger and bigger until she eventually decides to go on a long journey that takes her to Mexico and to a Mexican town. The movie was pretty good. It didn't take long for the girl to get her confidence back. I enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was very well-crafted, a fantastic adaptation of the novel by the same name and one of the best adaptations I've seen in a while.   I loved the whole thing from the moment I walked in.  For those who don't read the book, it is about a former college football star who has a lot of demons and issues and who is in a state of mental decline. He is also very good-looking and has great charm but is struggling to make a living playing football, which is the only thing he seems to enjoy. He lives in a small town, the place he thinks is where his past, his family and his roots are and also where he can find a sense of security and peace.  He is approached by a guy (whose name I never caught) who has seen and known him in his younger days and he wants him to come out of the shell he is in and become an inspiration to kids.  And it all comes together for him.  I think the best part of this movie is that it has the best use of the song "When You're Gone" by the Irish band Derry and the Beat.  It really has a sense and feeling of the sadness, isolation and isolation of an old man who is about to retire and is searching for his life again.  I just realized what a great story this movie has and how it really captures what it feels like to be a lonely old man looking for a sense or peace and happiness. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There was nothing else like it.   The film is made up of two parts, one with a girl whose parents have committed suicide and the other one with the son who is on a quest for his dad.  This film will make you see what is really happening in our society, this will make your eyes water and your heart beat faster.  With a little help from her friend,  Rita and her friend are going on a little holiday with her father and her family and have to face what life is really like in that kind of family.  But then, they start getting attacked by zombies,  it is not a nice sight, but is it a funny one?  No, I must say, you are not going to see a comedy like this, this is a grimdark horror film that will have you running for your life.  One thing you must not do is watch this in the cinema,   After watching this film, I felt like I needed a shower.  It is a masterpiece,  I am not kidding you, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have been around this blog for a while, you are aware that the films I make have nothing in common other than their title.   I'm talking about The Lost Weekend (2004)   which was a thriller in which a young couple are taking a vacation to a beautiful island when a series of disasters occur that threaten the lives of everyone around them.  For anyone who has never seen a James Bond film, this movie is a perfect example of a film that I believe is one of the greatest movies ever made.  A beautiful blend of thriller and romance with lots of action, The Lost Weekend   is one I think everyone should see.  This film was the first time I really appreciated 007 in a big budget, action blockbuster.  It was great in every way and was a very emotional movie.  You get to see Bond in a very real sense, just as if he were a real person.  The only flaw I saw in this movie was the end where it seemed like the whole world was going to come crashing down and then just kind of ended.  Still a great film!   Now for the review:  The film opens with a helicopter being blown up over a beach, a man wakes up on a beach in the middle of nowhere and a mysterious woman appears and starts telling him how they are going to escape from the island.  At this point, Bond has already played the part of a super hero in a couple of films, this was his first big action film and as you would expect, he had a lot of fun!  On the island, Bond finds himself in a bar with a bunch of people, they are talking about the island and how to get to it, when they notice a helicopter flying overhead.  Bond gets a little excited and shoots a bullet in the helicopter to take it down, however it turns out to be a decoy and he winds up in the chopper.  He finds a way to get down into the choppa and gets off with the help of a girl who has been there since the day before.  Now, I was not the biggest fan of this girl because she was a bit of a bitch and it seemed she was just there to be Bond's hostage.  While she was around, Bond and the helicopter start to have some adventures together and the island is invaded by a bunch more helicopters.  After a while of chasing them down, Bond is captured by some guys and

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a well-produced movie. It's not much different from other movies about the Vietnam War; it's a great, well-made movie. There are two parts to the story that I liked and that was great to see how they depicted the Vietnam war in a really cool way and made it look so realistic and just a bunch of soldiers in a jungle fighting a jungle. The acting in this movie is excellent. The movie itself was not a great movie but it's definitely a fun movie. If you like a good, long Vietnam movie you'll love this movie.

I wish there was more of these types of movies, like the movie "The Book of Life" or "The Secret Garden." The movie itself is an important one to remember.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film starts with a man getting beaten up by three women. This is a fairly common occurrence in this type of movie (even if it's pretty well acted) and the movie doesn't go into a lot of detail about why all this happens, but it does lead to a fight with a knife. What follows are scenes of the men trying to find out who all these women are and why they've been attacking him (all of the women wear white) and some more of the violence.   Some scenes show the violence being used for political reasons, which might not have a point.  They do have to be there if this is a war movie.  Some of the attacks have been on women because of their "sexual attractiveness" (and they've tried to kill them). They're the women with the breasts and not the women the movie is about (the story seems to be focused on the women who are beaten up).    There's a lot about these women, and a lot in the story.    The women have very little dialogue and there's no explanation for their actions.  It's about men who feel they've got no place and are going to kill or die to make the world a better place, and as such they go out of their way to get people to blame each other and make people think there's a war going on.  The main female character seems to go on and on about her breasts and her life (she has a very odd look about her), which isn't really interesting at all.  But the women do have something to say about men and men's role in life and the war (it's a good point).  It would be more interesting to hear more about it in the first half.  There was a point where there was a flashback and the narrator was telling this story and it seemed to be all about one of the characters but it seemed pointless to go back and replay it.  This movie would be interesting to see the characters in other movies, which don't have as many similarities. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am giving this a 5 because I liked it, I liked the story and I liked how the movie was written. I really enjoyed the movie and I think that the ending was a bit cheap, however I don't mind that it was a bad ending, it was still funny to me. I watched it at midnight and I was very tired by the end of it, and I am glad I watched a movie that I enjoyed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie made by an American studio.  It's about a man who has a very small penis and needs to find a way to please a woman who is a goddess.  She does love it very much.  They made it so simple and a little cheesy, but I think it was meant to be.  The actress in it is so gorgeous and funny.  I really enjoyed it.  A wonderful movie about a guy that needs to figure out how to have a woman love him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has an interesting plot line, and is a good watch at a good time.   The movie is about a young blacksmith who is about to move to a remote region in the country. The movie starts with him getting out of his truck, and having a long discussion with his neighbor about the best way to get some wood to make a fire. He has a conversation about the good ol' days of the old country, and his neighbors.  They get to talking about how they all got to the place that they are now in a truck.  They talk about the old way of doing things, and how there is a difference between a good guy and a bad guy, or a good town and a dangerous town.  The town is quiet at night time, and has a pretty good movie theater.  His neighbors try to talk about some things, like how the town doesn't get much money.  He shows the neighbors a good way to start a fire with one big log and some sparks, but it burns to the ground, and their conversation gets a little bit creepy.  One of the older men asks his neighbor what their neighbors are saying.  This leads to another conversation, and the neighbor brings up how he has heard about the bad things that are going on in the town. The older man asks if the old man is worried about them.  While talking to the older neighbor, the other one gets a call from the police, asking to come outside. The guy says they have to go because the police are trying to kill them.   He takes his gun, and takes his neighbors with him, and leaves. He goes outside and finds the police in his front yard.  Once again the neighbor gets a gun, which he keeps hidden in his house.  On the way to the store they see a car full of guys with guns, and they are trying shoot some of the guys.  That is when the movie starts to get a little creepy. They go to the town store, and as they are going up the hill, they have a little argument with a guy at the bar.  I feel like if the guys in the movie had the right to own guns they could have done something to the guys at the bars.  After a short argument, they leave and get back into the car.  What is not clear is whether they are heading for the house they want to live in, or going to the house that

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good:  Like it:  I'm pretty sure I can find a better movie about a vampire, but the story was so good that I'm glad I watched it.  A vampire hunter team, including a guy that looks like a biker, a girl that looks just like a cat, a guy who looks like he's been bitten by a vampire and a man who looks just a little too much like the Vampire Hunter, fight a Vampire Lord to save their town.  The movie had a great mix of vampire mythology, comedy and action.  There were scenes that I didn't expect and some scenes that made me feel a little sick, but in a good way.  I found myself cheering when one of the vampires started fighting another vampire, so that's a good start.   I wish I knew more about this movie before I started watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Tropic Thunder" is an entertaining movie. This movie is based on the short-lived TV series by the same name created by Dick Van Dyke, the same writer as Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds".   I liked the movie.   It takes a comedic approach with humor and heart.  A little too much humor for me, though, but I like it all the same.  The story is fun and has a twist at the end that was unexpected and worked well in the movie; I did chuckle out loud at some points and the last third of the movie is a good use of flashbacks and humor that I really liked.  For all that I liked it, I'm not a big fan of the main character.  This is where the comedy begins to wear off, but then "Trap Thunder" gets back on track.  It's great to have Dick Van dyke and Alfred Hitchcock in one movie. As for the cast, they were all great.  I really wish Dick Vandyke had come back for the sequels, but he didn't.  "The Tuna" and "The Snoot" also feature the same director, Dick Van Derke.  "Tropics Thunder"   For a review of a movie that I enjoyed, see The Last Movie: Tuna Told by Mr. T: http://www.moviesquad.com/reviews/the-last-movie-tuna-told-by-mr-t.html
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I have to say that this was one of my favorite movies. I watched it once and it just did it for me.    When I saw the trailer I knew it was going to be a good flick. It had a great concept that was very good. The plot of this flick was about a couple who were trying to get away from a world of people who hate them and want them dead. The story told was very well done. I liked how it was portrayed with their situation. The acting was good as well. It's not a good story but that's what makes it a good watch. It was a good way to watch this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always had a love/hate relationship with The Omen.   When it first came out, I loved the idea of a guy who became a vampire.  I was a huge fan of the Omen, so I wasn't too disappointed when it came out.  The cast was great, especially the leads.  I remember when the first movie came out (that's in the US) and it was like watching a comedy (not that one) at a time when horror wasn't all that popular.  As a kid, I remember being very confused by all the characters.  But they all get their moment in the sun.  Even the villain had a great scene in the third movie.  And if you haven't seen the third Omen movie, then you're in for a real treat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of this movie is not very interesting. This movie is an attempt to get a film made. It does not have any real story, or plot. This is an animated film that tries to make a point. There is one sequence at the end where the director is talking to the kids and telling them a story. It is very similar to " The Wizard of Oz." I think that this movie would be very bad if it had any original plot. The animation is good and the kids are very funny.   It is a good little movie for the family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know I was going to watch this with my parents because we got the tickets at a movie theater together.   I was a bit confused by how the plot seemed so simple at first.  It seemed like a really normal school where a guy (a girl at one point) goes to do her best to help other students.  But a boy with a mysterious power decides to use it for evil.  This guy had the power to change people and to make others do whatever he wanted them to do.  He would use it to torture and kill his friends and enemies.  I didn't understand why he could do this at first, but the more he used it, the more I realized the nature of his power.  By the end of the movie, I started to like him a lot.  At first he was the least likable character I had ever seen, but by the end I liked him a great deal more.  For example, he made the boy who was in the wheelchair play with a toy truck.  Then the boy tried to run away but the truck made him fall and he almost got crushed.  And I'm sure that the boy was very embarrassed about the whole thing.  The story was good, the acting was good and the music was pretty good too.  Just like the movie itself, the plot ended on a cliffhanger. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say? It's a very entertaining movie. It was well written and well acted. It had some good laughs and it was really well done.   The only thing that bothered me a little bit was the fact that there were a lot of talking animals.  And finally, a comment:  -The title is rather strange. The whole movie feels like a comic book.  -I think the ending was better than the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, here we have an old school film made by a studio with a name that does not mean anything: The Orphans.   What this film has is a very interesting story and an interesting set of characters. The story is about a group of orphans who live in the forest outside of the city of Lutat.  This film was created in the 1980s and is set in the past and takes place in the 1950s.  The film takes place at the time of World War II.  It is a simple yet intriguing story about a young boy who lives in the forests outside of Luto and is forced to grow up and make his own way in the world.  In a nutshell, I really liked this film.  I hope they make a sequel but I don't think that's going to happen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of action packed thrillers, the action will come fast and the characters will be well drawn. The action will be intense and will show the bad guys (and some good guys) how to defend themselves. I would say the characters were well drawn and there was nothing that could be done to change that. I really enjoyed this movie and would watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I was watching this film a few days ago and I had to say I had a great time watching it. As I was going through my review I thought about the film a lot but I didn't have a lot to say about it since there's a lot about the movie I didn�t really care for. But this film didn't really make me feel bad so I didn`t really want to talk too much about it. But I will say that this movie was a great action film from an action film maker who really had a lot of love and passion for the movie and the people involved in it. I also liked this film because there was some great performances by everyone in it except for a few characters I didn?t like. The story is what you would expect and what I would expect from a David Lynch film in that it's not very interesting. The movie had a couple of moments that were very intriguing like the one where the guy tries to get the girlfriend to marry him in the movie. The scenes with the people on the boat and the boat with the guys playing cards were really cool. The plot to me was very predictable and boring to watch. I loved the action scenes but they had a bit too much and it made me feel like the movie was going to be another David Lynch movie but not really. I don't think the movie would really appeal to many people since it's a bit of a disappointment to me and I hope this movie doesn't make many people angry. I had no complaints about the cast of this movie since everyone played their roles well but this movie had some characters that weren?t very believable. So I hope people enjoy the film but I feel there are some bad guys in this movie that don't really work well with the story but who is supposed to be evil don?t bother me much because the people don? t really like the bad guys and don?' t really get along with the good guys either. So if people like the people they don't like the characters I can?t blame them. But if you don?''t like the film then don't watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved it   In all honestly this movie does not hold a candle to the original and is really not even that good imo but I loved how everything was done in the 90's and how the old school comedy was done with a lot of fun but a lot more seriousness too. It was really funny when the old guy died and the new guy is the only one to still be able to drive a truck (I can tell that because he was talking to me about how to drive the truck).   The only thing I would say is that they went a little overboard in the beginning by adding a lot too much of a comedy in the form of jokes and the characters and not as much in the storyline of the movie which is good but I was not a fan of it.   Also for the first 10 minutes of the film I was laughing so hard and was like why the hell was it happening.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie based off the trailer and the premise of a guy being stranded on an island and a little girl, I think it was a girl because I can't find a boy on a girl island   I don't know why there is a boy stranded on a island, maybe because it has nothing to do with his character or because he's just a man with a big heart (which is kind of a theme) I really like the idea of him stranded on the island and having a nice long conversation with his new friend who is a girl   After the film was over I asked my mom what we had seen, and she said we had watched a movie called "It Happened One Night" which was a movie about a young woman who meets a man and falls in love, it was the kind of movie you could see the little girl being swept off her feet by the man and it is a really sad movie, but also an incredibly funny one   It was so sad that when I saw a little boy who is in love with a girl I had to ask my mom if he was like her or some crazy person, but she said yes he was really nice   That being said I did love this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was never too into horror movies, though I have loved a number of them over the years.   A little bit about myself and my interests:  I'm a writer and a professional reader.  I love fantasy literature (I read the whole of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series in one sitting when I was 14), as well as the more general "historical" genres.  A couple of my more recent fiction works have been in the fantasy genre. I've been working in the publishing industry for over three decades now.  My love of horror movies is a result of having been raised in the South of England.  The most popular TV programme of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great sequel to the first movie: it is very entertaining, very funny and a lot of action, although the violence is not gratuitous, it is a lot more realistic and less graphic. It takes place in a futuristic Los Angeles and is set in a city with no name. The heroine (played by the great Catherine Keener) is on the run from a gang known as "the Four-Eyes". The leader of the gang is played by the brilliant Laurence Harvey, who also appeared in the first film. He is an interesting character who has a bad temper. He thinks that "nobody will notice that I'm gone". He wants to use a computer chip to steal and control a huge amount of money. But the thing is that there is a very high-tech city under his control, with no names. He needs a name that everyone would associate with money. The gang leader says: "We've already had a few name suggestions in this part of the city". Laurence is able to guess what name the gang leader is thinking of. The leader then asks Laurence to kill him. The "Four-Eights" are about to discover that Laurence has a very unique way of killing people. This is not simply the same sort of thing we have seen on the screen in films like "The Exterminating Angel" and "The Running Man", although it is more extreme. There is no obvious way of doing it, and it is done on the spot. It is done by an ingenious "stiletto" that has two spikes that hit the back of the throat: a "stilletto" is a stabbing weapon that does not rely on the use of a knife. As the victim lies dying, Laurence hacks at his throat with the blade and the "stILLEtto" takes off the victim's head. There are several things about this movie that are quite original. Laurence takes the role of a very good detective from a newspaper: he doesn't get involved in criminal investigations but instead finds ways to make his job a bit more interesting. It all ends up with a robbery that is not too tough. Laurels shows a great deal of intelligence and ability in solving crime.

My only complaint is that the dialogue isn't very clear and I wouldn't say that this is an action movie, but there are some cool effects that happen. I think the story is pretty good, so it could even be considered good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really surprised I haven't given this film more than a 3. I love this movie and it's fun, but it's not a perfect movie and I don't think it could be a perfect film because it's more of a fun movie than a classic movie. It's a fun time when you're just hanging out with friends on a beach. It has fun music but it has a lot of silliness in it. It is a very low budget movie that's not really worth seeing, but then again, the only reason I'm giving it a three is because it has something special in it for every guy out there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - April 11, 2008Great Movie  Reviewer: Boney - favorite favorite favorite - April 3, 2008  Subject: This Movie is not Bad at all!! The movie is about a man and his dog that travels to another planet. He had a really bad day and gets on a spaceship where he finds an old dog named Charlie and a cute girl named Alice. Charlie does not like the humans and has a really nasty personality. They take off and when they arrive at another planet, they run into a little girl named Lulu. The little girl's name is "Lulu" and Lulu loves dogs. They all become friends. The film starts out with a great song and then it gets to the planet where the humans are. They live in a huge city and the whole city is covered in trash. The people there are very stupid and they keep getting mugged. When the man and the dog go back to the human world to get more food, the man has a bad accident. The dog dies. The man has to take a job cleaning up the trash and all of the people in the city are mean to him. Charlie, Lulu and the other humans take him in and they all live happily ever after. - April 2, 2008This Movie is Not Bad at All!!  Listen: What the movie was supposed to be about was the dog and the man trying to help the little girl and her dogs by cleaning up trash. It was supposed have been a real "dog and man" film. But it is a silly film that is too funny to take seriously. I do not recommend it to anyone. - March 17, 2008Not a great movie  Rating: [ 4 of 5 stars]
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a well-made movie.   At first when I watched this, I thought that it would be similar to my previous films.  But after watching it, I noticed that this movie isn't the same as my previous movie.  This is a totally different movie. I am so glad that this film was made and released in 1994.  Because there is not another film that I can recommend to the public like this. It is completely different from all other movies I have seen so far. I have watched it over and over again. It takes the viewers back in time to a simpler time where people loved to laugh and play.  I think this movie is a great idea to make a movie for children.  When I was a kid, my parents bought me a copy of this movie. It had many of the same scenes that we all know about in this movie, but it was a different movie with different music.  It was a fun movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie in a small screening room in the library of a college campus. The movie was presented in a typical high school setting: the high school class of the main character is trying to make a movie about a little white mouse who is trying very hard to impress all the girls. The only thing the movie has going for it is the cute mouse, and the movie takes place during the summer, so the movie is quite a bit in the summertime.   A simple story but really fun, I don't recall seeing anything quite like this on the big screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the movie starts, the opening song and dance are a little too on the nose. I am sure they were inspired by some movie, but I would have preferred a more subtle touch. It is also a bit too heavy-handed at times to say the least. That is until the movie gets going. The story is quite good, and the film is funny in the best possible way. Some scenes are a bit on the cheesy side to say that, but the movie has some good humor. I like the way that they get back to the old days. I was surprised how close they were to those old days and how they still looked so good.   The music is a good touch, and it is good to see the same old movie being put out there. I have been a fan of this director since he put out the first "Pigface" movie in 1986. This is a fine film, and I am glad that he is still making this kind of movies. I hope they keep making them, and he keeps making movies like these. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen a movie like this in awhile. It's a must see for everyone. This movie has a little over 3 hours total. It has some of the best acting ever in a comedy/drama. The movie is actually about a boy with a secret that he wants his dad to be able to share. When it all starts out with a bang, it soon begins to become a lot less enjoyable. It becomes repetitive and boring and it even gets silly at times. The only reason I watched this movie was because of the awesome ending. It was quite nice and I actually liked some of some of it better than the original. The ending was a real surprise to me. There were some good and some bad moments. But that was it. It wasn't as good as it was in the beginning and that wasn't much of a surprise.    Posted by Alex at 9:56 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when I was a young teenager (18 years old), and at the time I had no idea what it was about. I thought it was a science fiction movie in the style of a few other movies in the genre. I was wrong. In this movie we have a scientist, and his assistant, who is also a scientist. The scientist, named Dr. B.E. (Eddie Murphy), is an extremely intelligent person. One night Dr.B.E., who has been given a job by the Government as a geneticist, discovers that the children of a rich family, in whom he is interested, are developing a highly unusual and extremely dangerous virus called the "Ebola" virus, and he has a small, hidden lab in his home that is dedicated to the research of this virus. This is what led him into the "Humanoid Project." The Humanoid Project is a project where Dr.Ebol is sent to a remote and unpopulated island, where he will conduct a genetic study of the human population and the virus, the only living organisms on the island. There he finds, in the village of villagers, children with the "Lizard-like" disease. The virus will kill any human who gets close to it, and they will die. If one person touches the virus it kills the person too, and will die, and even if you touch it yourself you will die of a lethal virus infection. There is a small group of people, who are immune to the virus and who live on a small island called "The Island." They are separated from the main human population of the island, but have no idea that this is the case. Dr.D.B (Jack Nicholson) who was sent to the island to conduct the study, is an intelligent, caring and caring young man, who has great respect for Dr. Ebol, and for the people of The Island. One day the young Dr. D.B., who was not expecting his brother's "death", is attacked by a "zombie" (a human without a mind) who has an obsession with the island and Dr. E. Ebola. As a result of this confrontation Dr.C.B, who had not been sent to The Island to be with his sick mother, comes to the Island to find his brother. What follows is a battle of good and evil. At the end of the movie Dr.R. (Paul

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked this movie. I think it has a very good ending. It's really a shame there was only one time this was ever made in English.   The movie starts with a scene of some very cute, young girls playing in a park.  It's not long before they are kidnapped by some people who take them to a farm, and from there to the house of a little old lady who owns a farm for fun. She runs off, the girls are freed, and she makes them go into the woods to get some berries.  When they get there, she tells them a tale of a girl who was cursed.  The only way she can get out of the curse is for the girl to die by the hand of her lover.  This girl goes in with her two friends who are all very curious and are excited to see if the girl is really cursed or not.  There are three scenes that are really fun to watch. First the girl, who seems to have no desire for anything, just wanders the woods aimlessly looking for berries. Second the boys who are playing with their dolls find the girl and try to help her. And finally the two of the boys are on a picnic in the park and they make a couple of really lame jokes.  At one point the girl seems to be in a kind of trance. Then all of a sudden a dog comes trotting towards them. The girl is terrified and screams, and the boys run away. Then in a scene we never see in the movie they are both killed by the dogs.  After the end of the movie it's interesting to look at how a movie like this is done in real life. The girls are never shown to be crying. No one in this movie has ever met a girl like this.  And you know what is funny about the dogs? They don't like kids. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. The movie is about a bunch of old people in a place called "Old Lark Lane", who do all they can to get their next fix of alcohol.   There's a man named Mr. K, who gets drunk pretty often.  One day he gets in a fight with a "dagger-thrower" and gets drunk too much.  He comes up to a man called "Holly" and asks if he wants a job as a "house keeper".  Holly doesn't care.  The whole story is about their old age and Holly's drinking.  It's quite funny.  As for the characters:  Mr. P is very old and a drunk, his wife was also very old. The other characters: Hoots (Derek Hale), a retired man who has a drinking problem.  Mr Lark (John Cleese) was a bad man who tried to steal the woman, "Lady Mary", and the money from him.  Finally a "good man" called "Lolly" appears.  In general, it's just a wonderful movie with a good plot and lots of laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a great adventure from start to finish. A great movie and a great way to start out the year of 2006.   I didn't like the movie: I did not love the movie. I had a bad time with this movie. Not even a good, not even a really good movie. This is one of those movies where you get a good idea, the camera moves smoothly and the action is good. What I didn't enjoy was the story. The story is the story of a guy (John Travolta) who is on a journey to find the best wine in the world. But the movie was so slow and boring that there was no real excitement and a lot of boring stuff happened. The whole movie feels like a "what if?" sort of movie where you see what could have been if you didn't waste your time on this movie so much.  What I enjoyed:  I have to admit, I like Travolle. I liked the movie and I thought it was a good story and movie.

It doesn't have an original concept, but it's a very entertaining movie with a good plot that has a good end-end theme and even a good ending theme, it's worth watching it all the way through. If you are a fan of a good sci-fi movie like The Sentinel (aka The Matrix) or The Matrix Reloaded or anyone else that's good, you will enjoy this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always been a huge fan of The Wire. As a kid I'd watch the episodes in syndication, when I was only around 12 years old. I thought it was a brilliant show that was able to portray the city in a manner that really showed the brutality of the situation in Baltimore. I was in middle school when it first started and I remember being so excited when one of the detectives was shot by a drunk guy during a drug raid.   This was followed up by a police chief getting shot during a raid by a rival police officer, it got so real.  I remember so much of this show and I'm so sad that I don't think it will ever be again. I'm sorry that there aren't more episodes out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        In an age when even the biggest comic book movies don't get to do much, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight makes a bold and refreshing contribution to the superhero genre with a very different and unique approach.   The Dark Night is a dark and grimy adventure that takes a dark turn halfway through.  In the beginning, the film is a surprisingly entertaining and exciting fantasy adventure and quite funny.  By the time the main villain, The Abomination, appears, he looks pretty bad but it turns out he is very, very bad and that is before Batman gets involved.  As the film goes on, the action rises to a new level and it looks to be a good, entertaining ride.  I think that this is a great addition to Batman's long and very storied history and it doesn't take away from the previous movies.  A very good time was had by all.  The movie was rated PG-13 for some graphic violence, adult situations and some crude language.

I thought the first time through the movie was a little weird and I wasn't sure if the girl from the first part was real or a movie character. I'm happy that she was real because I wanted to see this girl play some real characters. But I am so happy that it was a real story of a woman who is being treated badly and doesn't want to change. I can't say how good the movie is but I liked it and hope to see it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a person who enjoys a good action movie, you should check out The Expendables 3!   It's got great action and explosions, great special effects and great action scenes.   The plot is a little clichéd, but it does its job in bringing the characters to life and making you feel for the people trying to survive, no matter what.  The characters were done extremely well, and you get to see them interact with each other.  In the end, you feel bad for the characters when they lose.  A well done movie that you will enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In what is surely a rare occurrence for me, this review has actually come out as a positive one!  I've always had a soft spot for the character of G.J., even before the recent appearance of his father at his home, and with the help of his new brother-in-law Tom (Paul C. Reilly), he seems to be in excellent shape.  G. J. is not perfect, however, and he is not without his faults; however, G.I. Joe is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie and I have to say that I was actually quite surprised at how accurate the G. I. Joe toys were to the comics.  I loved the scenes in which the robots and G. Joe's crew took on the "G.J.'s" enemies; it was just an awesome set of scenes to watch.  The sound design was also extremely accurate and I really enjoyed the music in the movie.  There was a little too much "trying to be real" in the film, but I was able to accept it; I just don't really get it sometimes.  Overall, I was really happy to see this movie, and a good way to cap off a great year of cartoons.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen a movie that I had the time to actually think about while watching.   This movie's plot and characters are so incredibly ridiculous that it was difficult to take any of it seriously.  The plot of the movie consists of two teenage girls who have been forced by their parents to get married to two men. One is a rich man who is the husband of the bride. They are very happy.  Another man has a bad temper and is very loud. The woman is very quiet and gentle.  It was fun for me to see them have a fight, but not funny.  I like to laugh sometimes.

Their tour is delayed by the driver who was driving on the wrong side of the road for about two miles, and by the time he realized he was wrong the bus had crashed, killing his passengers and the driver. It is interesting to see what the passengers would think of traveling for hours on a highway without a driver, when most of the time they would be traveling with their own driver.   The best scenes in the movie are where the driver talks about his car, talking about it being the fastest car in the world, and talking about what he would do with the money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad I finally watched this film!   When I first heard the title, I immediately thought of "Roland" (the classic 1980's film, if you're a fan of the 70's and 80's).   The trailer made me wonder if it was going to be another "R" movie.   This isn't.  And while it could be compared to the classic, the story is a bit more "mature" than that movie. It does not follow the formula at all!  It's really hard to describe this movie. The only thing I can say is, it's a film about a father (Robert Duvall) who is going to make a trip to visit his daughter in London and has to change his mind about the trip.  The story is very well done.  A lot of things happened in this movie, from an old man to a man who wants to leave the US to start a new life.  Also, it made me question if Duvalt was really his own father or not.  While I do not think it is Duvald's best film, I can't say that it isn't worth seeing at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good horror movie, but the story is somewhat weak. The setting is somewhat different, and I think that's because the movie was made to promote a book. I think it's a very good idea that the movie is meant to inspire people to read the book, but I think the movie doesn't do it well. The film is based on the story of a man, William Ragin (played by a very funny Mark Webber), who decides to visit a cabin in the woods with his girlfriend, a young woman named Mary Jane. They are both very inexperienced, and as they learn, they are very attracted to one another. Their attraction is so intense that they are going to have a baby. When they go to a cabin, William discovers that there is an evil presence, and he doesn't like it very much.   William and Mary Jane end up doing things that they aren't ready to do, and William starts to die. Mary Jane tries to stop him, but eventually gives in to his wishes.  The ending is strange, as is the beginning. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw "Sisters" as a Christmas present for my family. I liked it. I'm not sure I could have enjoyed it if it hadn't been an instant favorite for me. My wife and I split the film, we watched it both in bed, and in the living room. We didn't do it again, but it was good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a great example of the "horror comedy" genre. I really like horror movies and I liked the horror comedy. This movie has a lot of laughs in it but it also has a really good plot. This one is a little more about the characters and not as much about the plot. It does have a really strong story though, so if you like those type of movies I recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I think of the name John Carpenter, I imagine a sort of gothic, science fiction movie with a creepy soundtrack. When I see the title and trailer for The Thing, I don't think I'm imagining things.   It's very much like what John Carpenter did with Halloween, but a good horror movie, a good science fiction film, and an action movie all wrapped up in one, with a very good story.  The movie is really good.  Carpenter has a good way of using a small cast of characters to set the story up for a good scare.  A scientist called Gordon (Richard Dysart) goes to the Antarctic in an attempt to find an animal he's never seen before. But it turns out he's not alone, and the people on the island he's trying to get to don't seem friendly or easy to deal with.  There are several action scenes in this film, a bit of horror and a good laugh.  I enjoyed the ending a lot.  It was so dark in the end that I couldn't bring myself to go and see the movie again.  That's one reason I enjoyed it so much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie follows a college graduate (Kira Buckland), who travels through the country looking for a job. When she meets up with a mysterious older man (Tim Robbins), she begins to feel something for him.  He is a great lover of women and is very handsome.  As she develops feelings for him she finds out that he was previously married and that he has another wife.   This is a romance film with a great romance and a love triangle between two women.  It is the kind of film you wish you could be a part of.  I do think this is a wonderful film and highly recommend it.  I was so surprised to find a film like this! This is very romantic and sweet. The plot is fantastic with a love story, as well as the drama that ensues between the main characters.  This film is full of romance and good characters. You can't say a bad thing about this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie that is essentially about a man who hates the fact that his life has to end and gets to relive it every time he visits his parents, there's surprisingly little to complain about. The acting is all done by two actors, and neither is particularly good. The most convincing is a little girl played by a very young Natalie Portman who seems to be in the movie for the first time. She has the same awkward way of talking that Tom Cruise has, except with a bit more of a sassiness about it. The problem with it is that it's so natural and naturalistic that it comes across as a bit forced. Also, I never get the feeling that the movie is going anywhere other than through the motions.   The pacing is a bit on the slow side, with some of the best scenes being the ones at the end where there's not much going on. I would prefer something like the old western films that featured some interesting dialogue and plot rather than this very conventional, if well acted, film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love these old black and white movies, but most of them are a disappointment, because they don't do much for me.   The movie begins like a typical ghost story, but ends up being something that I haven't seen done, or done very well.  In a very odd way, it is more haunting than scary.  A man, who is supposed to be a ghost, is actually a guy who looks like a ghost. It is possible that the woman who looks to be his daughter is actually his wife, but he has been married for many years and his wife never appears to him. He is married to a woman named Alice (the title is a play on words) but the movie is just as much about their son.  They all live in a very small town and have a hard time keeping up with all of the problems in the world. This is a tale about a man who decides to make a deal with the devil.  I suppose one could call it a cross between a Western, an early James Bond film, and a mystery.  The idea that a devil and an angel (I guess they are the same being, I don't know) are playing tricks on humans is a very interesting concept, especially when you see that they actually live in this town and they keep to themselves (only showing up in the movie once).   Some of the ghost stories I have seen are pretty lame and I am not really sure where to begin with this one.  It is a short film and I guess if you are a fan of ghosts, I recommend it for that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very nice and exciting movie.   The plot is very simple but the ending is very interesting.  I really enjoyed the story and I think this movie is better than most westerns I saw, especially the ones about outlaws and outlaws.  This movie is a real treasure, the production is superb and the actors are fine, the only thing I don't like is the bad guy, I think he is too good looking.  For a Western the characters are interesting, the action is good and the plot is interesting. This is a good western to watch with a good beer and a good steak.  A great movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. I'm not going to lie I thought this movie was going to be a boring and pointless story with nothing to do but have everyone get together and talk about something stupid. I had high expectations for this movie and was not disappointed.   After watching the opening trailer I knew what I was going see. The story is about a young man who is going through a terrible time and has a crush on a girl (this is how he starts to date the girl) but she is the first girl he has ever dated. He has been out of the military and he has been homeless and he was trying to find a job. He meets a woman (played by a fantastic Marlee Matlin) who is homeless and lives in the sewers. When she is in trouble she does not hesitate to call for help. I love a good character and this woman had no problems playing the part of the heroine. She even tried to seduce the man at first but then he had a change of heart and took her back to his place. It is a dark film but there is humor in it which makes the whole film more enjoyable.  It takes awhile to get going, but once it does it is a really fun movie.

The way the heroes' ships were built and their equipment is superb.  "    If you like action movies then this is an absolute must see.  I'm glad I got to see it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most memorable scenes from a good film:  A great example of how a good story needs to be told:  The movie starts with the character of a man named Randal St. Germain, an ex-cop who goes by the name of Randal, and who is currently living a good life. While riding a bus down the city streets in New York, he is approached by a gangster named Michael, who asks him for some help. St. G. comes up with the idea of robbing the jewelry store where Michael lives. When Michael is taken, St.G. does it.  When he gets back home, his neighbor, a woman named Laura, who has been watching him for the past three days (because he is so honest and hardworking), is looking forward to having a nice time with him, but it turns out she is only doing this because she thinks he is looking for a way out of her life. The next day, he meets a girl named Jessica, who turns out to be very interested in him (she has a boyfriend, who is also looking for St.g., and thinks that he is too honest to get along with him). St. g. goes to the jewelry stores he has done in the past and meets a guy named David, who sells him a few pieces of jewelry (it's not until after the robbery that he meets his third victim, an old couple who were walking to a park).  The following day, St g. meets a man by the street named Tommy, who was once the leader of a gang called The "Punk Rockers" who were responsible for robbing and killing many people. He has been in jail for about a year now and he tells St. Gl that he knows a man in Queens who can put a stop to The "punks" before they cause any more trouble. When they meet a man called Eddie, who helps St.gl, Tommy and St.gel go to the neighborhood where they can meet David.  After they arrive at the address, Tommy gets out of the car, pulls a gun on David (the same man who was the leader in The "punk rockers"), but is shot and killed by David. Eddie runs away, but St.Gl calls in the help of a new character named Peter to help.  While they wait for Peter to come, a man runs into the gang's hideout and tells David that his gang is being chased
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a film from 1978 that I liked quite a bit. I haven't seen the original but the trailer was really good and made it seem like it had a lot of potential to be a great film. In fact I have a good feeling that it was a good film because the story is actually pretty cool. I think I liked the film pretty much because it was made by Peter Hyams and I don't think you should judge a book by it's cover.    I've seen a lot more movies by Peter Wills in my time and his most notable works are "The Man Who Killed Lucille", "The Girl who Knew Too Much" and "The Wicker Man" but this one, while being his most famous, is one of his best. It is a movie where we see what the movie is about. In this movie we see a man who lives a lonely life with a bad wife, a dog and a cat who he has to take care of for money. He doesn't think much about his past, what has happened in his life, the people he has killed or killed himself. He is not the "perfect" man, he has the same problems that a lot other people have and that is a part of who we are. We don't know about his family so we don't really care about them. His past isn't very exciting but it is what it is and it's something we have to deal with, there is no need to dwell on the past. He just wants to get on with his life. We see a movie about a lonely guy in a house.      He has a dog who is an innocent, very innocent. She doesn't try to bite anyone when he tries to get her away from him and don't worry, we won't see her try. He has a cat.  In this movie he is lonely and he can't have anyone to talk to or to be close to because he doesn't know anyone else in the world. He thinks that if he kills someone he will have a wife and a family, but the truth is that he doesn`t know if he will. We only see what he has done in the past and he is very sure he will kill again in the future but he just isn`t sure. He does have a bad relationship with his wife but they have a kid together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      This movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. The music for this movie is great, but the story is not that good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       You can always tell a good sci-fi flick from a bad sci- fi flick.   The script for this one is just as good as the first one.  The action sequences are good but still not as amazing as the previous movie.  It has more of the usual sci-Fi set ups that you would expect, a ship crash landing on the planet that is inhabited by a strange people and strange creatures.  So what's wrong with this movie? Well first of all the writing isn't great and sometimes the dialogues feel cheesy. I always felt that the whole story could have been told better and I do understand that.  That said this movie is a great sci- film that I highly recommend anyone to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all I'd like to say this film is very good. It was quite funny and a good flick. It is an example of how movies are made now. It also is funny and has a good storyline. The cast was great and it was good to see a female lead and an older male lead. I think most of the films of today would be made by that cast. I'll be back for a second go at this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched the film to prepare for an episode of an amateur science fiction radio program in which the narrator, John Hartnell, was to be an advisor.  I've been wanting to read about the first robot, and this was a very good book to do it with.  The first film of the series,  Star Trek: The Motion Picture, was an excellent science fiction movie.  It has a very clear vision, good acting, and good sci fi elements.  As a robot in a futuristic, war torn world, the movie had a definite sense of urgency, like a good war movie should.   The character of Riker was much better developed than in the series: he was a more than decent soldier, and the movie was more about Riker's character development than the story.  Star Trek has some very good moments, but the entire story is very repetitive.  There are only a couple good moments (i.e. the first encounter with the Borg), and they are more than repetitive.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A really great movie.  I really enjoyed it!   It was pretty hard to watch.   I thought I was going to like it.  But the way they filmed it  I felt I was watching a porno.  Well I can't say that I hated it, but I hated the way the porno felt.  It felt like they used to be in high school.  "Oh my god we're so weird"   This movie just made me feel bad for it's characters.  So weird.  One of the characters was just weird. How do you even describe a guy who thinks he is a dog?   The rest of the kids are all pretty weird, I don't like to like the bad guys so much, I like to watch the good guys and not the bad guy   ( I guess it is the other way around ).   Oh my god that ending   Well that was some fucked up shit.  And the way that they filmed   was disgusting!  This was really great.  The soundtrack was amazing!  I'm going to watch this again right now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the few that has made a good start. The story is about a guy, who's life is completely controlled by his imagination. He lives on a farm. He doesn't go outside. He's a "fog-watcher." He has a dream of being a farmer, and has a whole lot of money saved up. All his dreams become a reality and he can move about the world. As his dreams start to take shape, he is haunted by a ghost who is following him around, making sure he doesn't get out of his world. When he meets a pretty girl who shares his life, his dreams begin to become a real world.   I really liked the movie, and think that it is a pretty good adaptation of the books. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A must see!!   When I heard that the director of this film, Joe Dante, was a big fan of my favorite anime, Dragon Ball Z, I couldn't believe it. I thought this would be a completely uncritical remake, with a different director and an entirely new cast.   But what it turned out to be is a great film, with good acting and a solid story, but the action scenes are not as great as I would have liked.  I thought there were some cool fights, but not enough to make up for all of the boring scenes where everyone does nothing.  When the action is good, it is great, but I think this film would have been a lot better had they done this remake with a less expensive cast and a better script. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A small, intimate film that's worth seeing.  It's a well-written tale of two brothers who move to a new town and find themselves facing the same dilemmas that young people face on a regular basis: family, jobs, a new roommate.  There's a real simplicity to the movie that keeps it from being a bore or a preachy piece of junk, a simple story that's simple in a good way.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a decent movie that makes good use of the "Jurassic Park" template.   I didn't like it, but it's not terrible.  You should not watch this movie until you've seen a few of the other "Jungle" movies.  I don't like that the movie tries to use the dinosaurs as a metaphor for the modern age, but I didn t feel that way at all.  As for the dinosaurs, well, they are not real, but they do look like real animals.  Although the movie has a few moments of suspense, it never really grabs me.  The movie doesn't have a big focus on any one character.  However, there are some interesting moments.  Also, I recommend this movie to fans of the original "Jour de Foudre".   "Jurass-Park" (1990) Movie Rank - 6.5/10 6. 5/10 Summary   "Jurgen -Park" is a movie that's supposed to make us think about the dangers that we are constantly faced with in life. The movie tries its best to do that, and even though it doesn't manage to be an action-packed movie, it's still interesting.  6.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of the classic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy by J.R.R Tolkien, and I was thrilled to hear the news that a new film version was being made by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh.  I was a huge "Lord" of the rings fan in my youth and have watched the entire trilogy more times than I care to admit.  The special effects in this film are phenomenal, the special effects are breathtaking!  The costumes are just wonderful, and the acting is superb.  While I'm glad there is a new version of this timeless classic, I have to admit the "Lord Of the Rings: The Two Towers" is better, in my humble opinion, and much better than the first "Lord".  I think this movie could easily be a trilogy in itself, and would recommend it to anyone who loved the first film.   Follow us on Twitter:  twitter.com/BurtWimmer - @Burtwimmer
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had heard about this movie before and finally decided to go see it. This movie is the same story as the film "Crocodile Dundee" but this time the character is named Jim Carrey and the plot is much different. This film is based on the true story of a group of guys who have gone to Europe to meet a woman and then get kidnapped by a crocodile, they managed to get away only to be discovered by the police.   The movie is pretty good.  The scenes are set in a circus, you have a very good performance from Jim Carrery and the characters are fun to watch. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you who don't know, this movie is based on the true story of the "Stolen Valor Act" in the United States. It is a film about a U.S. Army Captain who goes down to the Dominican Republic and joins up with an American Army private, who is a combat veteran, to help out on a mission to capture a bandit. Both Captain and Private go down in a plane. Captain is going to steal a Valor medal from the local military base and bring it home for his wife. The story is well written with a well done script.   What I liked about this movie: First off, we have a Captain that is a former soldier and knows how to get the job done. Second, we get to see him do his thing on a battlefield. Also, the story is a well written, realistic one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was going to watch it with a group of friends on a movie night.   It was just a movie about a guy and a gal who go to a place called a "Stall" and get all of their problems out of their system.  One problem they run into is the wife gets stuck in a tub of ice and is frozen.  But the good guys in the group help to rescue her.  This is what I had wanted in a movie.  It has a lot of action, some good dialogue, and some interesting characters.  The story line and characters are a little cheesy and a little stupid but they make you want to have a good time.  I enjoyed this movie so much I actually bought a DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best horror movies I have seen.   It has a different feel from most movies.  It is not scary like many of the horror movies you see today.  You will be surprised by what you see.  This is not your typical movie like many people are complaining about.  In my opinion this has one of the most unique look to the horror movie genre.  The plot is pretty simple but its not a typical horror movie plot.  A couple is on a vacation and on their vacation comes a weird feeling.  They stay in a hotel and there is a ghost that wants to scare them.  While on their cruise they decide to take a trip to the old west.  When they arrive to the Old West they are attacked by a group of cannibals.  On their way to help the couple the cannibalis kill them and they can't save them. The couple doesn't remember what happened or what is happening to them. When they are back home they meet up with a few locals who ask the couple to join them in a hunt to find the canniba- lis that killed them. After several hunts the locals realize the canniberals are responsible for killing the couple and kill a group in the middle of the night to get back at them.    I recommend this movie to anybody who like horror movies and if you are a horror fan you should try this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   . The movie is in French, and it is the second time I saw it in the cinema. So I do not have much information to go by about the story. The story starts in the early 90's, and when the first war breaks out, people do not want to leave France. People want to stay in France, and so a group of friends form to make a band, or to play music. This is a story about love, and friendship. At first, the band does not do much, but eventually they become a band that can play in a large venue. The band members are: Jean-Baptiste (Jean-Claude), Paul (Pau), Thierry (Paul), Philippe (Philippe) and Romain (Rémi). The whole story revolves around Paul, a shy and sensitive boy, and Jean-Clauste, a very outgoing boy who is also very shy, but he loves the music he plays. He also is a bit of a troublemaker. Phillipe and Romaine have a big role in the story too. Phillippe is the bassist of the band, and he likes to play the best of his abilities. He is very musical, and his passion can sometimes become annoying to others. Romaine has an evil character, as if he has some special music which is capable of changing the world! This character is very interesting to watch. Jean-Claudes role is also a rather unique one. He seems to be a very nice man, but at the same time he is not the person you want to spend your evening with. When the band goes on tour, there is a period during which he is very angry, and is also the only one who has an idea of how to get rid of the bad feeling the band is having. He tells Phillipe, who is in the audience, to come back into the band and play some of his music. Paul plays the guitar, and Phillipe plays the drums. This will make Paul sad, and Romelle and Phillippes anger rises. Then Phillipe asks Jean-claudes to join his band. This idea turns out to be stupid. Phillis friend Romaine does not agree, and there is more trouble than Jean-clermes would like to know about. After the first tour, Phillis gets more and more angry with the other musicians. And his band mates are often a pain in the arse to him.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was made by some guy called Stanley Kubrick who lived in England for about 10 years and then moved back to the US. He had never made a movie before and he found he could make some decent movies with a small budget and very little supervision. He really is a man with a talent.   I think he has really found his feet as a director now. The camera work is pretty good and the plot is a lot of fun and well thought out. There are some nice and memorable performances, and I am impressed by how well the film stays on the straight and narrow.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie so good that it makes you want to cry when you see it. The story is simple: a young man (John C. Reilly) meets a woman (Jennifer Love Hewitt) in a bar and she takes him to a movie (a bad one) so that he can see what's going on in the war in his country (the war in Iraq). At first they get along so well and talk about everything - but when the war starts he begins to hate her and the war as a whole. This movie, so bad it hurts your stomach, makes you feel sad for the good people of Iraq and the good soldiers they have. And the ending? Well, there is nothing left to do but watch this and cry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a bunch of kids that were forced to join a gang called The New World Order. I loved it from start to finish.   I think the first few episodes was a little too hard to understand at first but after a few episodes it got easier.  The story is about some kids who are stuck in a gang but they never knew why until one day they are asked to join. The gang is made up of kids of all ages who are all of different backgrounds. Some of them are good while others are bad. They also live together in an apartment and have a bunch more members they are told not to mention that they are going to murder a bunch people that they don't like.  It was hard to explain at first why these kids are part of a gang, but I think in the next few episodes we'll get a more clear picture.  I liked the characters because they had their own personalities and the story was really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would like to start with saying that this movie was a really good movie. I think it is more about its own story than about the other movies and it is not like the others where they are just trying to be as funny and weird as they can and just end up being kind of boring. It's more about getting the comedy to come to a certain point and then just dropping it. The story is about an idiot and his idiot wife who are the best friends and also have a very crazy idea about them having their own movie that they call "The Man That Failed to Fail". They set up a movie studio in their basement and their characters are the owners of the company and they also have all kinds of weird ideas about what they think movies should be like. There is a woman who is a prostitute and there is a guy who is an actor and they have an actor who doesn't play the part very well but who has to pretend to be the real one so he can be in the movie.   They go to a party at a man's house and the man says he needs the actors to play the parts so he asks one of the actors and the guy starts to get upset because he doesn't like him. He gets mad at the guy and he yells at the actors that he is going to get rid of them.  This actor does not like him either so he leaves. Then he starts to yell at the other actor and the one who was supposed to be fired gets very upset because this guy did not know what he was talking about and he is trying to protect the guy.  Then this man has to go to the airport and the woman and the actor have to be very nice to him so the guy doesn't get angry.  The guy gets angry at the actor who gets angry with him.  And so it goes on like that.  They end up going to the hospital where the woman tells the guy that she has to get a paparazzo to take photos of his penis.  At the end of the movie there are these weird scenes with the husband and the wife and the actors talking about what is to be done about the men who are gone.  I was kind of bored and was wondering what they were doing so I watched this video and it just makes me laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "A truly remarkable production. This is a masterpiece of cinema, the kind where the actors perform their roles with the utmost devotion. This film is the masterwork of a unique and brilliant director."   The movie, in which a small town girl has a crush on a local man, is a story of a family in conflict and the gradual growing of a friendship. There is no romance in this movie, but what there is, is sweet and touching, even as it's being shown. The only reason I don't give it a five-star rating is that it's a little slow at times, which isn't unusual for an independent film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I like all three of these and I like them a lot.   There are many things in this movie that I didn't understand until I read the Wikipedia synopsis of the movie.  And when I read that summary the only thing that struck me was that it had all the right ingredients.  But the movie has its weak spots as well.  There is a lot of bad acting, the music is repetitive, the plot is not good, and it doesn't do any real good.    But if you don't know much about the series then this movie might be for you.  The movie starts with an opening that looks like it was shot in one location.  Then it jumps forward a little bit.  As you are watching the movie you have to figure out why a group of people have been called out and killed all over America.  Because a few of them are in a car, and the one that isn't is driving too fast.  After that the plot picks up and the characters are all talking about what they did while the car was moving.  When the movie is all over it is clear that there is a connection between the people killed, and that is the plot.  I liked that a lot!  And as an added bonus we get to see the people who killed them.  It is really a lot for a first film, but it worked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original film of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1972) is an excellent example of how to tell a story using only visual and aural elements.   I loved the movie, so I'm a little surprised that the remake of the movie in 2017 is not better.  It's a shame that the original film wasn't remade into a new series; the music in the original movie is still good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film a few months ago at the local B-Movie theater and it was very much worth the trip. I didn't think it would be this good but I am glad it is. This movie is not for kids. It has a bit of a dark side to it but the kids are still very well behaved and have a lot of fun. The cast and crew are also very well done.   As mentioned before the movie is about a band of misfits who are forced to go on a concert tour, only to learn about the dangers of the concert world, but are still able to perform for their audiences. There are a lot funny moments and a lot going on with some very well directed scenes.  I will definitely be going to see this film again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not going to go through a long, tedious review here, because it really does feel like a waste of time.   The plot:  I found myself pretty bored with the whole movie.  I was so interested in it, in fact, that I actually started to worry about it.  The actors (who have a really nice, varied, and sometimes even funny line of dialogue) were also all funny.  It was the first really serious movie I've seen where I really felt the pain of people with terminal diseases.  You know, the kinds of people who are on the brink of death and will soon be a corpse in the ground, because they were forced into a desperate decision.  So the way in which they went about their decision was really, really pathetic.  And yet I liked it, and it didn't bother me in the least.  Oh, how I wished that they had gone a different route, because the ending would have made a better movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie while in grade school and I still find it funny!   The movie starts off with a girl named Lisa who's in her high school's swim team and she was about to swim with this guy named Kevin who had this whole crazy idea of putting up a giant balloon on campus so everybody would be able to see what would happen if she swims under it.    Then they found out about the giant balloon.  So we see a lot of stuff happening at the swimming pool.  First we have the whole school going to Kevin's house to see the balloon. The balloon is actually bigger than they thought.  A little girl comes up and is about to ask Kevin what the balloon is.  Then she comes upon a whole bunch of other kids asking the same question and they start yelling at Kevin because he's an idiot.  But then a girl comes around and she's about to cry about the guy's stupid balloon. And then she's crying to get some attention, but then all the kids realize that her crying is because they're scared and want to make sure she doesn't get hurt because they know what will happen if the balloon falls.  After the whole kids start screaming about the balloon, Kevin and Lisa put it up.  It's a little bigger than Kevin thought it would be.  Now they see that a lot has happened with the balloon so Kevin decides to come down and try to make everyone calm down and then they're all ready to swim.  Finally they get it up so that they can all go to the pool.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The "Dune" (1973) is one of the more fascinating works in cinematic history.  It was made with a budget of $20m, so not even Steven Spielberg could have brought it to the big screen.  The movie is so interesting because it explores a new and interesting approach to science fiction, that is a sort of "what if this happened?"   The story revolves around a band of mercenaries that has been sent to a planet with a strong magnetic field, which causes a severe electrical storm every month.   When the group of mercenaries discovers the reason for the electrical storm is because of an unstable alien artifact, which is being protected by a mysterious figure.  And who is that mysterious figure?   And so, the mercenaries get involved with a secret mission to rescue a group of scientists on a space ship, who are being held captive by a planet that has a "dungeon" under a massive volcano.  With a crew of five (including the movie's best supporting actor, Dennis Quaid)   But there's a catch.  Because the planet is so inhospitable and hostile, the only way in, is to "scoop" off the creatures and "take a piece of Dune."  The mercenaries (with a few help from the other members of the team, such as Paul Freeman) are called upon to go and retrieve the artifact.  After being in the planet for two months (with the planet's surface growing hotter and colder, which caused the electrical storms, and the scientists being kept alive in a chamber under the volcano) the team is ready to head back home when the first major electrical storm hits.  Unfortunately, the storm takes a different shape.  After the storm, the team discovers a strange black spot, which turns out to be a gigantic alien spaceship, whose engines were in the ship that crashed to Earth.  So, the ship is moving and this is causing the electrical energy storm to be reversed.  Then the ship turns out be not alone; the two aliens are in the alien ship and they are going to return the artifact and kill everyone on the planet!  With the help of Quaid and Freeman, the group must save the scientists and then go and destroy the alien craft. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this movie was excellent. It is a very funny movie about a school teacher who takes a sledgehammer to a classroom full of kids and then they are forced to watch a movie about the day he made the class laugh. His name is Mr. Nefarious and he loves doing things like smashing the school and the students with his sledge hammer and it is his class in the classroom. The kids really enjoy themselves and have a lot of fun trying to imitate him while he goes about his business. There were a few times when the kids were pretty sure he was going to laugh, he would laugh a lot and then just stand there and make them do his routine. Sometimes it seems like he does not even know he is laughing and it was hilarious! This movie is about a sizzling class clown who just wants to go home to his family. There is no story or characters that we ever really understand or care about, he just goes about doing his thing like he always does. I found myself laughing at least once a minute the whole time. I think the one thing I liked about this movie is that it was funny in the way that you would expect an evil genius to be funny. A bit like the classic film The Wizard Of Oz   .  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The premise of this movie is so ridiculous that I can't even take a moment to look at it. What? A super powered vampire, how is it possible he got over 2 million dollars in funding for a movie? I'd be pretty surprised if he had the resources. And what's with this "evil" corporation that was going to "disfigure the human race"? There's no way that's happening. Not in the slightest. In all seriousness, I'm not sure how the movie is going to work, it's pretty much an excuse for the director to show off his abilities. The acting is pretty decent, but nothing too spectacular. The action sequences are pretty much standard, but then again, most action sequences in this film are. I'm sure some people may say the movie was rushed, I guess the fact that it is supposed to be 3D will take some time out of this film. But even then, that's the only real reason for rushing.   This is a fun little movie, but there's so much that could have been done better.

There is some humor too, but I feel it really gets under the skin a little.  I was expecting to be shocked about something, but the story really is really well done.  It really leaves a bad taste in your mouth, so don't do it if you are not really into horror:  You must admit I was surprised  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.   The movie is about a man who goes on a trip.  One night he finds a small girl, who is a little boy, on the side of the road.  When he sees her he thinks she is a girl, so he buys her a dress and lets her play.  Unfortunately it seems that this child has a problem with men.  She is very quiet and never wants to have anything to do with him.  He is so attracted to her though, that she does not have much choice but to be with him for the rest of her life.  The girl is not shy, when they get to the place where they are staying, she comes up to him, in a way he can't see her, and grabs his crotch and says to him. "Hey there big guy, I wanna play with you."  It doesn't seem to bother him and he lets her do it.  I really like the way this movie was done.  It is really nice to see a movie about a young girl with a very poor background, who does not want to play with men and a very horny man who takes advantage of that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is about a little boy and a boy who is just like him.  The movie is pretty good, I like how the movie is full of energy.     The sound effects are great.  This is a story about a boy, he is born with a bad, a real bad, life.  One of his friends who is a boy with the same bad life and the same mother.  She also has a bad life, but the girl is not bad.  Now she wants to go to a place to get good life like the boy has.  But the movie tells that she is not so good and she is going to get bad life too.  I like it.  When my son was a baby I told him, go into an empty house and get a good life. And when he did, the house was empty. And then there was a boy too. But they had a good, a good relationship.     The story is really good. The movie tells the story of the boy and the boy's friends and how the boy who looks like him get his life. The boy get a mother who has a good heart. He get a father who wants a good family and have good life for his children.  And this is how they live.  It's a really good movie.  Review: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not going to lie. The main problem I have with this movie is the dialogue. I have a bad habit of not paying attention to the dialog at the beginning of movies (i.e. I think the movie should be called "I'm Not Worthy," because the characters are all terrible). I was really annoyed by the dialogue in this movie. They sound like they are talking to themselves and not to one another. I mean, the main character says, "Now I'm no longer my little brother's protector. I'm his big sister. I am not what he needs. I will never be what he wants. I'll never be a happy, normal girl in the family." The other characters were also horrible. The boy had this attitude that girls are only good for sex and nothing else. And I don't mean that the girl isn't good for anything else, but they weren't. The girl was a good person, but the man was nothing but a psycho. And the kid was so stupid it made me wish they had never invented him in the first place. It's the kind of movie where everything that happens is completely stupid. It should never have been made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an enjoyable movie that is also a very positive movie.   "It's a dark and stormy night in the French countryside. You get up in the morning and go to your local pub, with a couple of beers in one hand and a pint of beer in the other. And you go to the pub to find a few old friends, a pint at a time. And at night, you go back home, but there's no one home, because you've taken off at a hundred miles an hour. The next morning, when you look up, there's a great big big storm coming in. It's like an earthquake or something."  ...   There's no real plot. It seems like a comedy movie. It is funny at times. It has a good script, though.  This movie looks so good, I love it! The soundtrack is great! The lighting in the movie is wonderful. The movie looks like it was filmed in Paris, because it looks like a film set in a french countryside. The film looks like the same type of French countryside that you can find in Paris.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this, I was surprised by the way the actors (including Tom Hiddleston) performed the scenes. The movie is a true Hollywood film with a lot of "star power" and a huge plot. The plot, though it's very convoluted, is a very good story and it's hard to get interested in it as the film wears on a bit. It doesn't take much of a jump to get into the big drama (one that can be really good if it's done well) and the film is good fun until the end, with a great cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the better war movies ever made.   As is the norm in those films where the protagonists are mostly civilians or soldiers, this one has an interesting setup and plotline that I liked.  I always love a good conspiracy.  Although the war is over and everyone is on the ground, I liked the way the film was shot.  The effects, although cheesy and not very realistic, are great!  The story of the movie is interesting and I liked how it was told.  In my opinion, it is better than the other war movies.  It is more realistic in a sense that it shows what war really is and how the soldier feels about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is really fun and well written. There is one major problem, however: the characters, while good, are really flat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting a bit of a weak film from the director but this was a film I could not put down.   The story starts in a small house in an isolated forest.  They are a family of three:      Mrs. Jules, her husband Charles, and her two teenage children.  Mrs Jules had been in a terrible accident and had almost died from her injuries.  It was a short time after her recovery that Charles found out about her death.  When Mrs Jiles was told of Charles' discovery she was not happy at all.  Charles was very upset about the death and was determined to keep the secret.  In a move to protect himself Charles came up with a plan to get Mrs Joles new husband and father a divorce.  After the accident Charles made arrangements for his family to move out of the forest in order to get away from the death of Mrs Jles.  The plan worked.  But Mrs Juls' children thought Charles was being unfair to his father and when the children found out Charles killed Mrs Jule.  As Charles tried to protect the children his life was turned upside down.     Charles was charged with murder and the only evidence was the testimony of the children who were unable to say anything about the truth.  Because of his mental illness Charles tried all manner of methods to gain access to the truth and these included: a woman, a priest and a witch.   The police were not interested in Charles's claims and a judge granted Charles a protection from self-harm order.  Eventually he did get in to prison and was sent to an insane asylum where he stayed for ten years before his death in the year 1985.  This is the book that made me want to learn about mental illness.  I never knew about mental illnesses before.

She keeps running away, running, running to a house and then she hears a baby cry. When she goes in the house there is a baby in a cradle and it is wearing a purple dress. She runs to her parents and they take her away. She stays with her parents for a couple of weeks and then goes off to her aunt's house. There she sees a little boy with a blue cape and she goes into the house and it starts with a little pink lady with a red wig who is afraid of her. They all go to the dance but it's not as much fun as it was when the boy was with her.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good example of what to expect from a John Carpenter movie. The pacing is perfect. Every single scene is well written. Not just a single scene or two. Every scene has a different theme. They all have a strong and unique storyline that's not in the slightest derivative. The action scenes are awesome. All the fights are very well choreographed and extremely well choreograph. They are also well timed. It's not so quick that you'll have a hard time believing what's going on. It is what it is. No big special effects or anything to keep your interest up. This movie would be a perfect film for the Halloween season. I think it would be great for a Halloween movie night. It has a very eerie feel that reminds me of the old horror films of the 80's. If this movie had more suspense and the plot was more intricate, I could see people coming back again and again. There are also scenes in the movie that would make a good suspense thriller. But, it's not like it is an over the top movie. It doesn't feel like a "trick" movie, but a straight up horror movie with good story telling and good action scenes. It works for John Carpenter. It makes sense and is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the most part, "The Last Days of Mars" was a pretty good movie. I loved the way it handled the story. The ending was definitely a twist, and it was well made. I do feel, however, that the movie needed a bit more atmosphere and a few more plot developments, but overall I still think that it is a good piece of sci-fi.   The Last Days   A short and sweet science fiction film. The premise is that a group of human survivors are attempting to cross into Mars' atmosphere, and that the last time they were there, they were completely destroyed.  The story is that they have been transported from the station that they live on to Mars, where they are now stuck in a small town. This place is pretty empty, there is only a couple of people, but that is ok, because they don't really know what to do. They are really just trying to survive.  A good amount of people die on their journey to Mars.  These people are from a group called the "Terrestrial Society", and they are in charge of running the station on Mars. They know that there are plenty of survivors from their last expedition there, but they are very scared to go and see how well they are doing. So, they have sent out a team of people (named the "Earth Rescue Team") who will be sent back to Earth to help them survive. Unfortunately, their ship (which is called the, "Mantis") gets wrecked on a meteor hit.  The Earth Rescue Team comes into the village, and the leader of the group, the guy who played "John Goodman" in the film, tries to give them food and medicine and keep them busy and happy. Unfortunately this doesn't work out very well.  One of the people that is on the Earth Rescue team gets horribly injured, but fortunately, one of the members of the Earth team knows a little bit about medicine and decides to perform an emergency surgery. The surgery fails, but at least the guy survives. Unfortunately it turns out that he has a nasty infection.  When he is first rescued, he is in a bad way. He is in pain, he has severe diarrhea and has been vomiting a lot. Eventually he gets better, but the infection is now very bad. He's not going to make it to Mars in time to see how they are progressing.  After some time, though, he comes to, but not

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was so good I was not expecting anything but I was really surprised at how good it was.   I can't say I liked most of the characters but it was good to see them in action sequences.  What I didn't like is that some of the girls had the looks of a little girl.  I liked that they made them the way they were.  But to the people who don't like it, please don't judge it so quickly.  It's a movie that is good because of the plot and the story and not for what the girl is doing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little skeptical at first about this movie, but I thought it was a pretty good movie for a Saturday night. The movie was a remake of a movie that I saw way back in 1974, and this movie is pretty much a remake as well. I do think the remake did a good job of giving a "good" movie, and it did that, with the exception of the music. I didn't think the song was anything special.   It's not like it was bad, but it's not the best song in the movie, or even the best one I've heard (for that matter). The movie also had a few good laughs and it was pretty entertaining.  I didn;t see the big action sequences like I hoped to see, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

This is a story that was based in the early years of the American Revolutionary War and the Battle of Yorktown was the biggest victory the American forces had yet to achieve. The film is based on the book of the same name, and is a wonderful retelling of the events which occurred on this day in history, with the story playing out like a classic Hollywood movie. I have seen it a number of times on TV and it was always a pleasure to come back to the movie theatres.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie    that is called 'A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night' is a good story but this movie is a complete failure. The movie starts with a girl, a girl who has no choice, no choice but to walk home alone in the dark at night. No one believes her so no one comes looking for her. She goes back home and sleeps her way through the night. Eventually she is found in the middle of the road by a man who is in search of a girl he sees in a dark alley way. The girl seems normal. No unusual things about her. The man takes her home, takes her back to his place where they sleep in the bed, get the water and the coffee, eat the eggs, drink the water, drink more water, watch TV, and sleep through the whole day. The next day, the man comes out of the water to find the girl sitting by the window watching TV. He has a lot of fun watching the TV but she does not seem to be watching TV very much. She only watches it when the news comes on. At one point during a news report, he gets up to go to the bathroom and finds his sister waiting for him, sitting at the window, a little startled that he is back. His sister is a little shy and quiet and takes a long time to even speak to him. Eventually he gets out and asks his sister, who is the last to see him in the house, what time does she leave? He is puzzled and curious. She is confused. He wants to know but doesn't know how. Finally he asks if they are living together. She looks down at the floor and says "we aren't" and "not as a couple" He asks if that is what the police is calling a relationship. She responds by saying, "we're not a couple", and when asked if she was ever with someone else. He looks confused, he asks her if she has a boyfriend and she says "no." She says this with a straight face and a calmness that she does nothing but look straight ahead. She says that she is really going to have to do some things in her life that she has never done before. She asks him to take her home. He asks her again, "will you go home by yourself tonight? " She looks up at the ceiling and says, "No. I can't go." And she walks away.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has a very interesting plot, the way it starts and then ends in a big explosion, a funny, but not too bad movie, some good action and action sequences, a lot of laughs and it's fun to watch, with a lot going on.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, we need to say that   (I'm not an expert) is a really good movie.   It is a story about a kid whose parents left for a trip, he was going to go out of town to find a job, but he gets caught up in the whole thing and is sucked into   it.  I think it was very well done.  There was a very well thought out script (I have seen a few bad movies like this in the past) and the direction was done by a guy who does   some really good movies ( I'm not a huge   fan of the "movies" of the late 60s or 70s, but I do appreciate   a great director doing   the movie he wanted to do).   The main point was that it was a well made movie, not a bad one, but a good one.  We got to learn about the kids' problems, and all that, and we also learned about   an old man who lives in the neighborhood, and who is a good guy (but it was funny).  The music, by the way, is amazing.  Finally, the   ending.  The movie could have done without it, but   we got to see what would happen to   all of them if they didn't do what they were supposed to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie ever!   I've never seen so much fun and good acting in one movie, especially when you factor in the fact that this is a comedy/drama/musical.   All the characters are really well written and some of them really grow on you!  It's got the right amount of violence/sex but the humor always keeps it light and fun.  The music is great too, especially the great song "This Is the Way It Should Be" by Rufus Wainwright.  I would suggest this to any adult that enjoys fun movies, well acted and well written, with a good soundtrack.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it comes to movies like this, I don't think a single movie comes close to this one. It was such a huge production with a huge cast (and crew!), and it truly shows just how much people care about each other. I will never forget the moments when they were just sitting around having a coffee, talking about life, and then some man comes along and blows everyone's mind! My heart just jumped into my mouth at the ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know, I'm a big fan of film noir. I was a huge fan of the original French film noirs and had a good time trying to pick the good ones from the many movies made over there.   I'm surprised they haven't made a more recent sequel and have never seen the old French film series but as it stands, the French films aren't so bad, they're not bad at all.  The only problem with the French series is that they seem to want to put a big focus on the women and that, to me, didn't work for me.  After seeing this film it seemed to have a much better balance between the men and women and it's always interesting to watch the men do something that they regret in the past but, by and large, the women just aren't all that interesting.  So, if you enjoy the French noir films, you'll probably like this one.  Recommended for fans of the French movies and lovers of good film noire
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want a good horror film about a family of vampires and werewolves, look no further than the first two installments of the "Vampires" movie series, in which the family is led by the mother and mother-of-all werewolves called Anya (Kathy Bates), who enjoys being a vampire and being a werewolf. (The series has more than one female werewolf, including an evil one named Tessa.)   The main character is the boy (Chris Sarandon) who has a talent for writing that seems to be growing and with this talent comes an interest in the occult and the supernatural.       He is an outsider who discovers an odd book about a group of people who are a little different from the rest, the "Grimm," which seem to be living in the woods like the witches and other folklore creatures of old.  It seems strange to the Grimms that their friends, the Vampires, are also living in these woods, so it's no surprise when they see that they are having trouble with a very strange creature that seems only to have the power of the light.  Once the werewolves have defeated the Grimm, they kill the boys father.  The boys mother seems to enjoy killing and is always able to get her revenge.  This film is the best of the series and the best overall vampire movie, I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is well-made and beautifully shot by Roger Deakins. The costumes are beautiful, the action is superb, and the dialogue is spot on.   When a film is as good as this one, you just want to scream, cry, and giggle. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that there is a lot of people who would like to see this movie again, for the same reasons as I did, but I think it should be noted that this is a movie about a child murderer. The story is pretty well written and told, but it still doesn't have much to say. It doesn't feel like the movie is really trying to be about that. It's only about a boy who's grown up, and as he ages, he still tries to be a kid. The movie has some good characterizations and it doesn't try to be funny. There isn't a lot to this movie, but that doesn't really bother me in the least.    The only way this movie made me feel anything was when I saw the picture on the movie theater screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-made, fun comedy that makes you feel like a kid in a candy shop.   It's fun.  There are no cliches here, no "oh no, a squirrel gets a peanut butter sandwich" cliched moments.  As in many other recent films, this one is funny and funny for its own sake.  The kids aren't silly or stupid, they're silly and stupid for their own sake, and we can just sit back and have a good time.  I don't really know what's so funny about them.  That's just the way they do it.  But I will say that the ending is a little too simple for my tastes.  That's just a shame, because there are plenty of things to love about it. It's just that the film isn't as good as it could be.  It's not a bad film, but it is not as good an action comedy as it might have been, or as good a coming of age film as it should have been. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... In the early-morning hours of a cold winter morning, a family gathers on the lawn in front of the house that is their home. There, they discuss the latest news: a shooting at the school in Newtown, Conn., a killing of a teacher. As they are discussing it, a young boy walks up to the front porch and starts playing with a toy truck. There's a young man, maybe fifteen or sixteen, sitting on a bench in the backyard, talking to a girl about her problems. There are several kids hanging around, and a young woman, maybe sixteen or seventeen, watching from a distance. Soon, the conversation turns to how the shooter was dressed, and what it was like to be in the classroom with the shooter. Suddenly the mother starts screaming, "He's not real!" There's another shot, and then a second. The boy falls to the ground. A voice comes over the loudspeakers: "Please leave. Everyone out of the building!" The boy is screaming, but he doesn't realize that he's dying. The child's mother keeps screaming "He is not real! Please, he is not a real boy!" As the teacher, the teacher's son, the boy's parents and the mother all get out of their cars, the shooter walks up and starts firing. The girl with the toy truck jumps in to try to take cover. The gunman takes a shot at her. The bullet hits her and goes through her. She gets up and runs down the hill toward the car. The police arrive on the scene shortly. After the initial shots, it is like a war. Someone throws a grenade, but it is not successful. The shooter is not satisfied with just killing and killing, however. He keeps shooting. At one point, he fires off several more shots at the teacher and child. The teacher has fallen to the floor. The woman with the kid runs up to try and get him. There is a young person standing in the parking lot. The man is shooting wildly at her and the kids, and he's not getting much in return. The young woman tries to run away, and the gunman catches her, and holds a pistol to her face. She manages to run down the street away from the gunman. He kills the boy next to her. He fires at the kid who is hanging around and watching. He shoots at the woman who is lying down on the sidewalk. She's hit. The two kids who

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the few original movies about the Vietnam War.   Very funny.  Very strong characters.  The Vietnamese soldier played by Burt Lancaster is a great role.  This movie is also about "a country in the midst of a major revolution.  In the revolution, the French and the Viet Cong are at war.  They need the land to live on.  It seems like everyone is killing each other...   An interesting war movie with some humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a few days, I watched "The Muppet Show" for the first time in over 40 years. I had watched it a few years ago on cable and loved it but hadn't watched it in a few decades because I didn't have cable in the early 1970's. Then I discovered that a DVD release of "The show" had been released about 10 years ago and I saw it for the last time the other day and I was thrilled that I was able to get it now.   The Muppet show was created by Jim Henson and his writing team in 1966 and ran for six years. It was very successful for that time. They were the only puppet show that was syndicated and they could be found on TV almost every Saturday night. The characters were very cute and funny and I loved them. The Muppets were a team of puppets but also featured an actor and a writer and I always liked that combination.  It wasn't a perfect show but I was happy to see the Muppeteers back in action and a new show was about to come. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw "A Boy and His Horse" at the New York Film Festival in 1995 and was not impressed. I have read so many bad reviews about this movie. I found it to be so bad, that I do not want to watch it again. It is a movie about an obnoxious and obnoxious kid. He is rude, uneducated, obnoxious, and he is a mean little boy. The only good thing I can say about the movie is that the actors in it are very good. The music is not good enough to ruin a good film.   For an obnoxious kid I love this movie! I found the movie too offensive for me to watch!   (4 out of 10)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking forward to this film ever since it was announced as the latest movie that's going to be released on Netflix.   It's a good action film with lots of violence and some good action sequences in the beginning.  The story was interesting and had a unique twist on the usual buddy cop movie.  In the end I found it boring and was not impressed with the acting or the story.  This movie would not be my cup of tea.

This was a very fun movie to watch and I can't wait for the next one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's story is an enjoyable and fast-paced story about a young man named David (Buddy Ebsen). He has a love for cars (a Dodge Dart convertible is his dream car) and is the owner of the 'Raging Stallion', a fast-moving sports car. David is also the owner and driver of a 'Pentagon Express' (a 'Stag' is the name of his old car). The 'Rising Tide' (his company name) has an automobile division in Washington, D.C. and David is a mechanic there. David has a very close relationship with a man named Paul (Darryl F. Zanuck). Paul is his best friend and Paul is always looking for his new hot rod (which David's 'Riding Stallion' is), which David has given him. They have a wonderful time together and David and Paul enjoy each other's company. But that's about the end of their story until the 'Pit' (the new hot-rod) arrives at their house. 'The Pit' is a really cool car (even more so than the old hot-rods that Paul used to own before 'The Pits' arrived at their home). 'The Stag' has been modified into a car capable of going all over the world (for the first time), which will soon be used to take Paul and David on the world tour that Paul and his new-found friends are planning. Their plans are to visit places that the media doesn't know about and explore new places to experience in the car they got from 'The Fords'. This movie is very entertaining, and is based on a really well-told story.   After the 'Rollercoaster' (an old 'Homer' cartoon), I couldn't get enough of the car, which was much more fun than I expected. The movie is good, fast-forwarding around the 'World' and the 'Journey' of the hot-tires, the 'Fords' and other 'potholes' that come along with the 'world tour'.   It is a short but fun movie, that would suit young children with little imagination, but young adults should also enjoy this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie.   The story and plot is great, but the acting is great as well.  The only problem is when the movie switches over to the flashbacks, but that's only because the flashback scenes were so good.  You might say that the ending was a little rushed, but then again the movie was over after only half of it, so it wasn't rushed.  I give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like to watch sci-fi, horror and a little bit of adventure, the classic sci-fier Nightbreed  is a fun movie. It has some really neat scenes, and some really bad ones too.   It's got a lot of scenes that make you think. The first scene is where a woman is on her death bed and gets a message from a dead friend that she can't understand. It's the beginning of a long night and it's the last day of the old country, and it sounds a little like a classic.  They come from a town called "Nightbreed" which seems like a very nice place to live. The townsfolk seem very friendly and friendly.  The towns folk have a very strong sense of community and it makes you think that there's a good life to be lived in this small town. It also reminds me of the classic movies The Thing  and Night of the Living Dead. They have a strong sense that everyone is in it together and it is a very peaceful place.  In the next scene we see the town getting attacked by a horde of zombies. The townfolk are all running around like crazy trying to kill the zombies. They even use a gun. The woman we see at the end of the movie is an evil witch who is causing a lot chaos and death. She kills a whole bunch of townfolk by letting their blood seep into a sink.  After the last scene, you know that the town is about to be wiped out by a zombie horde and there are only a few survivors left.  Nightbreeds is a good enough movie that I would recommend it to a few people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most underrated movies of all time is "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". This is the story of a small town in the middle of the badlands. When a mysterious train passes right through the small town it is discovered the owner is a bandit. The people are on edge, wondering what the train could mean for them. As the train moves out of town it picks up another small town about to be destroyed by a war between the good and bad people.       After the destruction the train goes to the big city and picks up a much more bad bandit gang and they go out to finish the job they started.  And they do. The train makes it to the city and it is stopped on the outskirts by the gang they put the town on alert and start the chase.  This is an epic gangster movie from start to finish.  What is a gangster?  I'll tell you a gangsta. I'll say that this gangster is the epitome of what a gangsta should be. The movie has that classic American noir feel to it. The story is fairly good too, but the movie suffers from a bad script and poor acting that makes it hard to watch.  A great movie, but don't expect much from it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have just recently completed the film version of Peter Falk's film  The Lady from Shanghai.   The film is based on the life of the celebrated author  Falk, a brilliant writer and a true master.  He was an incredibly handsome man, one of the world's best.  Peter Falk had no shortage of female admirers, all of whom were beautiful.  In one of his many affairs with women, he decided to marry a very beautiful woman and they had a daughter.  After a few years of marriage, he was still very much in love with this woman, and they were engaged, but the relationship had a terrible end.  While Falk was away with his fiancée's mother, he killed her.   His father was a well-known painter and they often spent their evenings painting together.  The two had an affair and Falk's wife was the intended victim.  When Falk returned home after a few hours of painting, his father was dead.  Falk was arrested and put in a mental institution.   This would lead to several long years of isolation in which he suffered from the physical and psychological symptoms of anorexia.  This was not a story of a single man who had committed a crime.  For more information on the man, his life and his novels, see Peter Falk, The Lady from Shangai. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few months ago I went to see an outdoor screening of 'O Brother Where Art Thou'. It was the first time I had seen it and I was pleased with the performance by Jim Carrey, as his character was just a little off, but that was okay, it wasn't horrible and I didn't mind.   After the film the director gave the audience a chance to talk. It was pretty fun.  What was so interesting was how the group of people sitting on the porch didn't seem to know where they were or where they wanted to go. They weren't going in any particular direction, they were just wandering in a general direction. What I liked most was the way he filmed them wandering around.     The film ended and they were taken outside and let loose on the street. The group was not at all in a good mood. I like the way the director shot it, with an outdoor scene in a very small apartment.  The group of men just don't look like people who would be a fun and enjoyable group to be with.  I can't say I like them either.  They seem like a group of rough, drunk, homeless guys who really should just get a job and go to a hotel room and get some work done.  But in the end they ended up being really amusing to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very good movie, but for me it lacks a certain charm. The characters are all very well portrayed and a few of them even feel like real people. All in all, I enjoyed the movie, and recommend it to everybody.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen any of the films in the Alien series so I am excited to go see this one.   It's a pretty good movie and there is a reason for that is the performance of Michael Biehn.  He is a great actor but not a lot of people are aware of this.  In this film he plays the character of Corporal Hicks which is played by Wes Bentley who is great. It's not so much a performance as a performance of Wes Bentley and Michael Biehl together with John Hurt.  They are great together and the film is great with a very good script.  Aliens was one of the best movies in the first three years of the 80s.  A film that could make you say "Damn those poor bastards I wish I could have been there".  The film is about a ship full of aliens.  The crew is the best cast out there.  We meet our crew members including Lt. Dwayne Hicks who is played wonderfully by a great John Hurt, we also meet Lt. Ellen Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver who is very good.  Then we meet Corporal Dwayne Bishop played by Charles Dance who is a good actor and it's good to see him in a good sci-fi film but he is only a small part in this movie.  There are lots of other good cast members including Ripley's mother played by Carrie Henn.  Her character is a very annoying character but she is very effective and when you see the movie you will know why she is a annoying character.  And there is the Captain, played by the great Sigourney Sigmund Freud.  This character is very funny in this film.  But the actors really do a good job in this. In addition to all these other good characters there is David Hasselhoff as Lt. Hicks.  Hasseley is a really good character. His character is played very well and he is funny as hell when he is acting.  It is not a really a great movie so I won't say a lot about the plot because there is not one. It is a simple story about a spaceship.  One could say this film is not too far from Aliens in terms of the plot.  I hope this film will not be a sequel because the plot is very simple.  After a while we find out there are no more aliens and the crew decide to get back to Earth.  Because of this the ship is destroyed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing I love about this movie, is how they manage to balance the fact that the guys are jerks with the fact the group they are in is a good one.   They have a good sense of humour, good songs and good stories, even with the most horrible plot line and character.  The performances are alright, but there are parts where they sound a bit cheesy.  A good group of guys, who do a good job with the story they are telling.  I have to go with this one over D-Day, due to the fact I had a fun time with it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll start out by saying that I had a good time watching this movie. It's a pretty good time, to be sure. It was fun to watch the story of what would have been the first real contact between the Japanese and the Americans. It had the feel of an old western, but with a much more sophisticated style of dialogue and film. This movie had some good action scenes, and was nicely acted, but not quite as good as some of the other westerns on the list. It also had a pretty decent storyline, and a pretty interesting cast of characters. The ending was pretty cool too, even if it did not end up exactly what the ending promised.   As a movie, this is pretty good, and not bad at all. I've always enjoyed westerns with this type of plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's funny, charming, and funny to be sure.   This movie would have been great if it was longer, but it is so short that it can be viewed in a half-hour.  There are plenty of funny scenes, but I didn't find it especially funny.  While I did enjoy the characters and their interactions, I wasn't really surprised to see a character get his leg broken by a guy wearing a pink hat.  I was also not surprised when a character with a prosthetic leg is a bad guy, as that is what you'd expect to happen in a movie with a bad boy, but to me this is the typical kind of movie they make:  Some people have very bad days.  Sometimes when you don't expect the worst things to happen, they don't, and you can be thankful that they didn't. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a pretty good movie, the only thing I don't like is the whole ending. It's a very clichéd ending and a lot of it doesn't make much sense at all. But even if you don't understand why, it still doesn't ruin the movie. There is also a very good ending to the movie which you may not like but I really liked it.   This movie is not much better than The Princess Bride and it's one of those "good-bad-good" movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched "The Great Santini" last night. The first 10 minutes of the movie were a little too slow but by the time we got to the final fight with the killer, it was pretty good. The killer was an Italian.   The movie starts out with a girl who is shot to death on a street corner.  In the meantime, a young guy (who played by Tony Manero) tries to pick up the pieces and protect her sister (played by Joanne Todaro).   There is a police officer who is just as interested in catching the killer as the victim.  I thought the police officer was a little out of his depth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of this movie is a little boring, with all the characters we've met so far being very stereotypical.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic science fiction movie that had it all: science fiction, action, suspense, heart-breaking, a classic movie I've seen many times and have enjoyed it so much it's become the movie I'll always watch.   From the brilliant script by J. Michael Straczynski and David Goyer to the brilliant acting by Michael Ironside (who I hope will be in many more movies to come) to the amazing sound design by John Williams to the wonderful music by the great Jerry Goldsmith, it all worked together to create a movie that is a wonderful sci-fi masterpiece.  I found the movie to be very entertaining, suspenseful and a great sci- fi movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen and enjoy a lot of horror movies, and I usually don't like to watch too much horror with a female, though the movie did have a very good plotline. This movie was about a very weird and different girl that lived in a creepy cabin on the outskirts of a small town. I'm sure it had a similar setting to a lot in the horror movies I watch, but it was much more entertaining. This was not one of my favorite horror movies but it had some good laughs and very creepy moments. I like to think I'm a better person than this person (I actually am not) and I don't think I will ever turn down a good joke or a good horror movie.

He doesn't really do much but he does do one thing... and that is kill a dragon with a gun.  I had a good time with this movie and I think that the director has made a really good movie, although the story is a bit too dark and there are some annoying characters but we just have to keep on believing in the characters and they will be alright. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A funny and interesting story.   It will make you think about some issues you haven't thought about before.  It is an action-packed and funny movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most impressive thing about this movie is the special effects (which don't really impress me), the music, the dialogue, the acting and the special "villains" (I loved that!)  .The first 15 minutes to 20 minutes are pretty average, but then there is this amazing ending with the most amazing climax of a movie I've seen. The characters aren't very interesting, the pacing is a little slow, but in the end, this movie just hits me like a ton of bricks.   For those who are not very familiar with the films of this director, the movie starts off with a great montage in which all the major characters appear, then we hear the "Swinging doors" scene. Now, this is a very cool movie. It has a lot of great special effects, but a bit slow paced.  I think this movie can be enjoyed by all, but I can see that some people would like it better than other people.  A wonderful example of "you can't keep a good bad man down."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this film a few weeks ago and I was pleased with it. It was a little slow at first, but it got going quickly. It had a very nice story line. One of the great things about the film is that it didn't focus on one character, it just focused on all the characters. And they all had different sides. You could sympathise with the characters, but then they would do something that would upset you at some point. The ending was a good conclusion. There were a few bad characters, and I can only hope that there is a good sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's the movie that is almost as long as the book and almost as weird as the novel. But it's about a person who has a very strange sense of humor and who has the same sense of humour in a different way that makes him very endearing to the audience. He has an amazing sense of his own wit, and sometimes, when he's drunk, he makes a bit of a mess with people, but he's really funny. It's like he's one of those people who says, 'That's all I can do, because I don't know any other way of doing it. I could be a very good writer, I could write the greatest novel of all time, I'm just a terrible reader, I don?t have a sense of the form. I am just writing for me and not for anyone else.' And I think he does a good job of that, he's got a terrific sense of how to write an amusing, intelligent, funny, romantic movie about a character who is a complete fool. "

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll admit, I had mixed feelings about this movie. I did enjoy it and like the characters. I'd have liked a little more depth but I liked the main characters (especially the girl) and the movie was funny. The movie is not as good as the first two. The second one had more humor and was a lot better.       "Possession" is a sequel that starts right where the first movie left off and is pretty much a continuation of the story.  This movie also has a lot more to offer.  Again, not as much as the original but it is good enough to watch.                             I will give this a three stars.

As the film goes on, the movie slowly takes you to places like England, Germany and France.  A very enjoyable movie to watch and one you will not forget quickly.  The story line is excellent.  One of the best in any movie.  I would definitely recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of this is an old school classic with great music and a very well acted script.   As the characters say...it is like a trip into another world with a strange character that makes a lot of weird discoveries and some great comedic moments.  This film is made in Canada and the cast are all very nice.  The acting is top shelf with most of the cast doing a good job.  I loved this film from beginning to end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My family and I went to the movie "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" at a local mall theater. I was the 5th person in my family to see a movie with the original cast.   This is the first movie that I have seen and I enjoyed it a lot.  The movie was very funny and good for a laugh.  I think that it is a great story that you could not find anywhere else.  There was also some great singing and dancing by the whole cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good example of a movie where there is a lot of action and lots of explosions, and you want to see the good people that have been affected by these things.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       So, I was at a friend's party and I saw this movie. At first I was really excited because I've never seen a big budget fantasy film that actually felt like a movie and not just some kind of TV show that just happens to have fantasy elements in it. It's really a nice change of pace and it has a real magic system, a real fantasy world, and a lot of characters that were all believable and complex and all seemed to have very clear and well thought out backstories, which also made it easy to relate to them and understand their feelings for each other and even when there were some moments of very cheesy acting and cheesy characters that could have been better but then again they weren't and it was a very entertaining film. I did like the magic system and I think that was really cool and fun to watch.   I think the film was well shot, but I did not like it's magic system. I think a lot more magic should have been in the film and a good magician like Frank (I believe the name was actually Frank Sinatra) would have worked well in this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The characters were all likeable.   I was surprised how much I liked all the characters and how all the personalities were different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot of this movie is a bit weak for a fantasy movie like this. I guess you can't say this movie doesn't have an original story, but it doesn't work with the story they present. It is a good idea for the movie. The movie has some nice moments but nothing exceptional.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing we didn't get to see much of in the movie was the friendship between the three lead characters in this movie. The guys get along great and I think it was very fun to see them onscreen for some scenes. We never really got to see their real personalities or the people they are around as they were all trying to look cool. But we did see the friendship as they would fight and argue when they were with each other and it was interesting. I loved how they were fighting because they would always laugh. The funniest thing about the movie is when they start to do their "Hollywood" routine.   It's like one of those sitcoms where the funny guy does everything right but when it comes time to make a big splash he loses his way. He keeps trying to do the same things that worked so well for him in the past but then he just makes a big mistake and gets thrown off-kilter. He is constantly getting in the way of the guys who can handle a joke and I just really enjoyed how the two guys who were with him throughout the entire movie were so entertaining. The last thing we see the guys in the car after getting arrested.  The movie was funny and made me laugh many times.  It has a lot of good laughs and it's a good car movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was watching a film called "I Love You, Mr. President," with John Cusack. John C. Cusacks are funny as a man can be and his character, David, is very good as he was the "good president" and was a nice person to get to know.   What I liked about this film is the character of President, David. I can see he may be somewhat of a dictator but he does seem to be a very nice person. I also enjoyed the storyline as it made it easy to understand what was going on.  I also liked the story line that allowed a bit of comedy and sadness.  "I love you, Mr President" was a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can call me a snob if you wish but if you ever want a great movie with a lot of wit, style, romance and mystery, pick this one up.

They set out across the countryside, encountering a whole load of weird things. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to be honest about this one. I wasn't impressed when I first heard about this movie. I really wasn't. My first thought was that this is an action movie? I don't get why people would do a bad job. That's why I was disappointed.   This movie didn't do anything wrong, but what it did do was well done. And to think that this was the first big action movie that wasn't in a comic book was just a joke. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of horror movies and this was pretty great. It's a fun movie with a unique plot, and the acting was top notch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is very simple, yet very effective in delivering the message in a very straightforward manner. This movie is the perfect example of how one can use humor to communicate a powerful message.   For a short, easy to understand film about a clown and the importance of humor in communication, it is surprisingly poignant.     This film is a great comedy with the kind of humor that you'll never find in a major studio blockbuster.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best and best-looking movie in the history of cinema. I would have rated this movie higher, but I couldn't figure out how they were going to put the music together. The music in the beginning is not very good. I didn't get much of an idea of what the story was about, but that is not a big problem since I am not a movie buff anyway. It is a good action movie that has lots of good fights. And it has a very good ending!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film, not much really bad in it but I think the story could have been better and some parts of it a little boring (I never liked the ending and when I think of a bad movie I think only of the ending, which is a shame because I have seen a lot worse in the past.) The acting is good and good for its time I guess, not bad by any means but not bad either. The acting can be hard to follow at times but I guess there is a reason for that. And I like the look of it, especially in the end. The music is a little like a bad film, at least they did a good job in not to make it too dark.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "In a world that is as hostile to women as it is hostile to human life itself, three strangers (or so they tell us) find themselves stranded in a small village after their plane crashes. After a series of bizarre encounters, the three of them are eventually trapped on an island inhabited by a group of vicious and bloodthirsty cannibals. The cannibales, or cannibaux, are so obsessed with sex that they believe that if a woman is born without a man in her life, that is tantamount to a death sentence. So it comes as a shock when a woman's body is found and, at the same time, a child is born from her womb. The three cannibais, however, will not accept this. As soon as they catch the child, they kill the woman and eat her body while the child is still in her womb and a little baby boy is born. As the cannibas begin to kill the child and the baby they decide that they would like a second child and they take the woman's dead body back to their home town for safekeeping."

As he tries to find out who he is, he meets an old woman who offers a blessing for him. But when the young boy is about to finish this blessing, a mysterious force sends a man to the shrine to kill him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a very big fan of the original movie and I have re-watched it many times since. I have always felt the original was a much more honest and grounded story than the remake, however, some things really stood out to me, such as the fact that our character, Jake, was the only one to really find a way out, even though he did find a plan. Jake's sense of humour is brilliant.   The film itself was beautifully shot, and I was always so interested in the new characters (not the ones that were in the first movie) and just how they could make things work in such a difficult situation.  It was funny, yet it was also very moving and realistic.  This film also really brought down the expectations of people from the first (which I think was really good) and gave a good insight on what the war is really like and how it is not all the bad news you are led to believe. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, a friend brought a copy of the film to my apartment. I remember being amazed at the film, I have seen it several times, but was not a huge fan of it until this year when I came across it again.   It is about a teenage girl named Roxy Lush who goes to see the "Slimer" who is her new boyfriend. They get along well, and when she leaves for the weekend to visit her sister in Minnesota she is kidnapped by a monster who lives in her grandmother's attic.  The film is very cute, and you get to laugh out loud at Roxy's silliness (though the monster's presence is so scary it is the best thing in the movie). The film's pacing is slow, and I was a little worried about how the plot would be done.  It does not quite have the plot I expected, but I am a little disappointed with it for not being as good as I remembered.  I do like the plot, it is not the best plot ever made, but the characters are very well done, and a lot of fun.  As far as the characters go, they are all well done. You get to see how they interact and how they react to each other. Roxy is a little crazy, but she is a nice person, and has a crush on the monster who she thinks is a "mole" from a newspaper.  There is a small love triangle going on between her and the monster, and she is definitely interested in her brother who lives with him.  Even the little girl who is kidnapped is a lot like Roxy, she is goofy, kind, and quite innocent.  This film is not just a cute girl who becomes a victim of a monster. It is a movie about a little girl that becomes a hero, and her life after that.

Then Bob found his wife, went to work at the lodge where she lives, had a nice meal and then got drunk and fell asleep.  When he woke up in the morning he went to the bear's hole and got a few bites and then came home to a very surprised wife.  There was lots of fun in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie when I was in the fourth grade, it was one of the very first movies I watched in the theater that was not about a man or a woman, but about people. It was just a movie about people, with a man and a woman that were sort of running around with a lot of other people, and they were all trying to find a way to escape a house that they had been in, and it seemed like they had all these problems that they could try to solve, and then the ending was just so kind of like something that would happen in a real life kind of situation. I mean, it had these little things that were funny, like the fact that the two people who were trying to get out of the house were not able to walk away, and so the first thing they did was they tried to get on top of the car, and the car would not let them go. They were both very desperate and all they wanted to do was run, so they just tried to jump off. And the car hit them, and there was blood everywhere, and all this other stuff. It seemed like all they were trying too do was escape, but at the end they ran right into each other, and you could tell they really wanted to be together, but there's something very tragic about that scene.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there is one movie I wish I could revisit again, it is The Black Snake Moan, a movie I watched just for the love of it's music and the way it was shot. The story is told from the point of view of a black snake who is a prisoner in a black cave. She is not a bad person and she is kind, but this cave is a prison, a prison that has been built by a mysterious evil being, who wants her dead because she has been telling the world about the black snakes, a secret race of snakes who live underground. When the evil being hears the black snake's song, she comes up from the cave and kills all the snakes. And she is so very angry at this black snake. But the black Snake, like I said earlier, is an innocent victim and she does not want her name in the paper for telling the people of the world that there are black snakes. The Black snake tells the evil creature that the evil is not who he says he is, he is evil because he is out to destroy mankind. She tries to tell him that his evil is the reason why so many people go missing, but she is told to shut up, because the evil snake doesn't want to hear it. The evil snake then tells her that she has a chance to escape, and that her name will be the reason she will not be killed. But she does, and the evil serpent gets angry at her, because she is trying to tell the truth about the snakes that are so dangerous, that they will destroy all of humanity, if they are not killed. The snake then escapes the black cave and the movie is over.   The Black Snakes are a dangerous race of creatures and they can change their skins, their hair color and even their faces to mimic others. And they can create illusions, which can kill their enemies, and even kill their mates!   And the movie ends with a final scene, where a beautiful woman is walking along the riverbank when she sees a snake coming up behind her. The woman screams at the top of her lungs and falls over, but when the snake comes closer to her and she moves, a man's face appears behind her, and a man who looks like the man in the film appears. He turns around to see what he is looking at. The man sees the snake and turns to the snake. The scene ends, and I was left with a strong desire to see more
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest "brave" thing I can think of about this movie is its ending:  The thing that got to me most is the ending.  I think a lot of these movies end with a pretty cool surprise, but this one ends as a "happy" ending. In the ending, you don't see the death of anyone in the movie:  the closest thing we do is a little girl in a red sweater talking to the girl in the white dress.  And, of course, we get the same ending again, the kid in the red sweater and the girl with the white sweater.   It is the kind of ending we get a lot in the movies: a little kid talking to a little white girl.  A movie that has almost no plot and just makes you laugh, cry and smile a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When we think of a good thriller, we imagine someone sneaking into a hotel and killing its owner and his wife. This film tries to pull a little of that. But unlike some of the recent films that have tried this, it is not about killing someone. It is about how a man loses his mind and begins to become a monster. It's an interesting idea, and the story is interesting, but not for the reasons that it tries to make it out to be. I'm not much of a horror buff, but I enjoyed this film. It doesn't scare me, but it is a bit of a grind, which is why it took me a little bit to get through it. I've only seen it once, but had a good time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never read a book like this in all my life. I would highly recommend this to any horror fan. I know this is a long review and this is just an overview of my enjoyment of the film.   The movie is a very effective and scary movie about a killer who is obsessed with a painting. He is trying to destroy it by ripping out a hole in the painting. When he does it, he is shocked to find the painting comes back to life. This is an interesting take on the classic ghost story.  After the film is over the narrator tells of a few things that happened to the characters in the movie and then ends the movie. I enjoyed this movie as much as I did the book. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the first movie I've ever seen in English that doesn't use the word "rape" or even "rape". It's more like rape in a way that the guy has a problem with a woman and then the guy tries to convince her that he wants her. She doesn't say no. The scene where the woman goes back to the guy's place is so dark that there is no word for it...just darkness. That's the worst part of the movie. It's like someone's taken some of the good bits from the Twilight movies. The man can't think and so he has to find someone to take his mind off things. I don't think the movie is a bad movie but it could have been better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film during a "Movie for Mothers" night at the local pub with a group of friends.   We were talking about movies and my husband suggested this one.  I didn't even know it was a real person until I saw her photo in the poster,  This is the perfect example of how someone can change their life.  It's a beautiful story of a young woman who is trying to make a life for herself after the death of her mother who died when she was four years old.  There is a beautiful scene of the young girl as a child running away from a very rude father who yells at her and tells her to get out and leave his house.  After the mother's death, the young woman becomes extremely depressed and thinks that she's never going to get a boyfriend and never go to school.  The woman eventually decides to work at a factory to support herself.  She then discovers the secret of the house and meets a man who loves her.  This film has a very good storyline with an ending that will bring a smile to any movie lover.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like the movie. The movie is fun and it's got a good theme about two brothers. The brother is a big brother who tries to make sure his brother doesn't have a drinking problem, but when he doesn't, he can't stand it and his brother leaves. He leaves his father, who is very proud of him for being the only man in his family to stay out of jail, to his brother and his little brother. He lives on his own with his little sister. As for the brother, the story is about him trying to do better for himself and to keep himself on the right track. He works in a restaurant where his customers can order any kind of food they want, and if they want to get out of there, they can come back again. The main characters are fun and funny to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you who have been on the fence about this movie, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie is quite well-done and is one of the most well-acted movies I've seen in a long time. The film, while somewhat short, is filled with all kinds of fantastic scenes and scenes that were absolutely breathtaking to look at. The acting, both by Tom and by the others, is well-written and very well acted. I wish I could have spent more time watching this film, and perhaps I could come up with a lot more to say about it. But, as always, it was simply wonderful and really brought a tear to my eye.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie " The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension   was the first film I watched and it was a very enjoyable one. It has a great storyline, amazing action scenes and a good ending. The acting is great and the animation is superb.   I have seen other reviews which say the director got too creative with this movie, I didn't find it that way, it was very good. I was a little disappointed that I didn't see a special effects budget, but that would have made the movie even better.   I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Buckaroo, The Adventures and the 8-Dimensional World. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know what I expected from a new version of a well known film: a remake, or a sequel, or perhaps the story is told differently (it's probably the latter) but there's still a lot to recommend about this: it's a funny, heartfelt movie, a love story told with a wink and a smile. It's certainly a great film and I'd encourage anyone to give it a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So what can I say about this movie? Well, it has some great action scenes and some really good dialogue. I am a huge fan of the movie and it is very enjoyable. The story is very entertaining and the acting is very good. The only thing that I do not like is that it is not a very good action movie and the story has a lot of repetition. It would be very much better if it was not so repetitive. However, this is only a movie.

While this movie is not as good as the first one, the sequel is still an entertaining and interesting film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An extremely well made thriller/thriller set in a post apocalyptic Los Angeles.   The characters are all believable, well developed, funny, and not a dull moment in the film.  The film takes place in the year 2028.  One day a small community of "Liliths" are created by genetically engineering humans and other animals into a peaceful and harmonious people.  It seems that humans and the animals have always existed side by side.  It was not until the development of "The New World" that humans were separated.  In order to escape, the humans began a "genetic breeding" program.  While this was going on, they were also creating a new species to live among humans.  A new type of creature was born, a hybrid of a human and a wolf.  These are not your ordinary wolves, they are bred to act like the human, with the same physical characteristics and mental abilities as humans.   The "Lily" are considered a kind of "superhumans" that were created as the last line of defense.   While the "Lilies" are not very intelligent, they have the ability to read minds and mimic humans and dogs.  They are, after all, a kind "superhuman" that have the power to control minds.  What follows is a story about this new breed of "Superhuman" being, a human who has been genetically modified into a dog.  (This film is very well done.)  The first half is about the training of this new "Superman" type of animal, a man named Carl.  Carl's family, or family that he thinks he has become, will be the only ones who are allowed to be around him.  During this time he will have to deal with the feelings he has for his new "lily" friends.  There is also a young girl named Evelyn who Carl is attracted to, and is also attracted to Carl himself.  This film takes a humorous turn at the beginning when Evelyn attempts to take a bath with Carl, something Carl is not comfortable with.  Also, the dog's "body" grows as well.  Later the "lilies" become the dominant breed in the human and dog races.  After several false starts, the "Huskies" are able to overthrow the "slugs".   This film is a must see for anyone interested in science fiction.  The film is
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason why you should see this film is for the ending.   There are some great scenes in this film.  You are transported back to ancient Egypt as you have a dream in the middle of a storm.  We see the pyramids, Pharaoh's palace, and Thebes.  The pyramids are built so strong they can take a meteor or a jet fighter hitting them, but if you are not strong enough to take a jet coming at you at 300kph at that speed you probably will be killed.  A strange and unique dream come true for the young girl and the director.  One of the most impressive special effects in a film.     My favorite part is that the pyramidal structure in the desert has been taken from a real ancient Egyptian pyramide and restored to its original glory.  It gives an eerie feeling when seeing this thing standing there in the distance like a ghost and an angel walking together.   The pyramides are built to have very strong sides and strong beams. It is said that the Egyptian's were very tall people and had a lot of power as they could build things in the shape of a pharaoh's tomb.  They probably also had a very large pharaoh as they only lived for about 1,000 years so a great deal of time passed before we knew what they looked like.  I am a little bit skeptical of this film but if it is real it is one of the more impressive sights I have seen in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie   is a real eye opener. The plot is not very complex. The movie focuses on a young woman   (Lina Medina) who has just moved to California from Mexico and a man, Enrique (Trevor Howard). He is trying to make a living as a photographer in a big city. She comes from a poor family and is looking to improve herself. After a while the money does not help her. She finds a job as a maid in a hotel and is paid well.   She is also befriended by a fellow maid (Patricia Arquette) and they begin to have sex. The film is very erotic and very sad. The two female leads are very good. They are very sexy. Their bodies do not show all their curves or are just barely covered. They look like regular attractive women.  They are both very beautiful and it would be easy to think that they are not so attractive if they did not have such great bodies.  There are also other interesting characters in the film.  I found the movie interesting as it told the story of a typical Mexican girl who moved to a big American city and was made to feel out of place.  This is not a very good story but it was a very interesting film. This movie would be worth watching even for those who have seen only one other porno film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really interested to see what this film would bring to me since I haven't seen many of these movies lately and I liked it.   The story is interesting and if you have a bad back watch this and you won't hate it but there is some stuff about the film that you don't like but I was still entertained and the movie looks nice too.  The animation is quite good.  And if you don`t watch movies about vampires and zombies this one will be a good change of pace. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this movie is a little different from the others in the series.   In this one, the lead is the daughter of an Indian-American.  She has a really funny voice, and is probably one of the funniest characters I have ever seen.  The movie is set in the early 1960's, when Indians are not allowed to go to college in the North, but in other areas of the country.  This is when a young Indian- American girl moves to a small town, and meets a boy.  They become lovers, and she leaves the small town with him.  When she returns, she is asked to go back to the Indian country, and join the Army.  After that, we follow her throughout the army, and the rest of her life.  One thing that struck me about the movie, is that it is pretty realistic.  Of course, there are things that are not really happening, and are just for the sake of it.  For example, the movie had a scene where one of our leads was in a hot air balloon, and all the lights were off.  It is a good gag, that makes the movie look realistic. My wife and I loved this movie, even though we did not know much about the Indians.  As the movie progresses, you get to know a little more about the world of the Indians, and we learned a little about the history of the Indian war.  We also learn a little bit about how the Indians treat and treat women.  At the end of the movie (or even in the beginning of the next), we do learn a bit about what happened in the Civil War.  There is a lot of information and history about the war in this movie.  I think it is interesting to look at it, even if it is hard to grasp at times.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a great movie, if it is your first time watching a movie in English.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am watching this film as part of the World War II Memorial series ( http://www.worldwarmemorial.org ). It's a very, very well done movie and a very good memorial to the war. It is not a movie for the faint-hearted. It has violence and it has gore and blood and violence and gory violence and gore and gore all over it. But it is not the worst movie I've seen this year. It does have a very strong and compelling narrative, and it's very well acted. I wish I could rate it a higher number, but I can't. It's pretty good though. It was a good production, so if you're a fan of documentaries that use old archival material, then this will be for you. If you're not a fan, you'll be left bored. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to finally check out this movie and I had to wait about 8 months for it to come out.   The movie is based on a book called "The Secret of NIMH" which is a story of a boy named Ethan's search for his lost brother, the first creature that came out of the black holes in the sky.  As for the movie itself I thought it was a very cool looking and well made movie.  It looks like a little film by Steven Spielberg and it has a very interesting story about an alien being.  I thought the movie was about a little boy who gets his first creature in the middle of a field at night after leaving his mother's house.  This little boy is pretty much a kid who is very much a little nervous.  While the movie does not have the same power that the book does it has more in common with it.  The story is not really told as well as it could be but this is the movie that made this great alien movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is set in a medieval Germany in a world where humans and vampires coexist, and there is a whole bunch of fun vampire stories out there.   I don't think this movie would be nearly as fun if it hadn't been filmed with 3 cameras and a crew of actors!   A few scenes were too long for me to remember, but I don' t think that will be a problem for long, since they cut a bunch of them.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen many bad movies and had many happy movies, but this one is a masterpiece! I am not a big sci-fi fan, and my husband didn't really like this movie either, but we both loved it!   There were moments in this movie that really got to me, there was the scene in the hotel room where the alien had been in there for a week or two and was very calm.   It was very sad and very powerful.  When the alien went back to Earth, it got very angry and started to attack people.  The best part of this movie is the ending scene. The people that are on the ship, the crew, the police, the aliens. They were all so nice, peaceful and friendly and the alien was almost like a god to the crew.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, it was well made and had a really good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first time I had seen this movie and I have to say this is a very good movie. It is a true story about a person who was a slave to his job and his job was to murder other people. He does not like to think about other people, and one day he meets a girl and starts to fall for her. He had no friends and no family. He is a killer and she is a victim. It has no moral meaning, it is not what is on the page, but I don't give it zero stars.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would say that this film is very good.   It has a very good plot, which is well structured with a lot of drama.  The movie features lots of action and a great villain.  It also has some good comedy scenes.  I like the main characters.  They are very likable and very likble.

The woman becomes obsessed with a guy (played in a very small part by Charles Bronson) and after a night of passion, she's turned into a vampire. She feeds on the guy's blood, which he does not want.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A really good movie that is well made and will satisfy most audiences.   It has been so long since I was a fan of sci-fi and also a big fan of the Alien series so when I saw the trailer and was shown the casting I was very intrigued. I liked the story very much too.  This is really a good film for sci- fi fans to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little apprehensive about seeing "Passion." I had a great experience at a local independent, so I was eager to see it. I was right, it was a good time.   It was more in the nature of a film you saw in the theater than a documentary. I think this is good for an indie film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would like to start off with a short review about the movie "Ghostbusters". It is a comedy and it's a really good one too. I can see the humor coming out of the mouths of the actors. The cast is excellent and the humor is really funny and you get a real kick out of them. It's the first movie with all 3 of the girls (Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon) and the director Ivan Reitman was able to put the pieces together so well and it all plays great. The special effects are great and the story really is a great one. It has some really cool moments and the whole cast does a great job. I really enjoy watching movies like this and they really are funny.    This movie is rated PG because of the gore and it is very graphic. But that's what I like about it. The jokes are very funny and the special effects of the movie is great too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a nutshell, "Halloween", is a fun horror film that will keep you on the edge of your seat for a good time.   "Hollywood", is also one of the best horror films of all time. "Hocus Pocus", is more of a Halloween movie and it is also a fun one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was expecting the film to be a bad movie at first, but it turned out to be more entertaining than I could have ever expected! The film was very different from most action films I've seen in the past and gave me a lot of laughs. The story has a lot to it, which is very interesting, the villains are quite memorable and the characters were very well fleshed out. I especially liked the character of the evil genius scientist and the two villainous characters that were created.    The villains were very interesting and the story was a lot more interesting than I expected. It was a nice change from the typical action movies I see in the theaters all the time. I highly recommend this movie and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an action movie that doesn't come with a lot, but still gets you excited. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the greats.   This movie has the best performances in the history of cinema and you can't imagine how it would have been if it were filmed today.  It's a very good movie, you might even enjoy it for a couple of weeks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like horror movies, especially the good old ones like The Thing, Alien and The Thing From Another World, then you have to watch The Thing, the 1987 remake that was directed by the fantastic Dan O'Bannon. The thing that made The Thing so good was the special effects, especially in the second half. The creature designs were terrific, but the effects were too. It was obvious that the effects budget had been too high, because they looked like a lot of green goop.         The Thing has a lot in common with The Thing from Another World (1978) in that it was a movie made by a director who could direct and produce the picture. The Thing was filmed on the streets of New York City in a real abandoned subway tunnel, and the actors had to wear full masks with rubber mouthpieces. It took a year to make The Thing. O'Brien, who directed a number of great movies including The Evil Dead (1981) and Hellraiser (1987), and the remake of Blade II (1985) was also involved.  The only thing that was different about The Thing is that it's been remade many times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had forgotten all about the movie, which is a shame because there are some great ideas at the start of the movie. The story follows a gang of kids who come across a mysterious old woman. She is so old and tired that she can't stand her own body. The kids set up a play and when the woman dies of a heart attack, the boys are horrified, thinking she has committed suicide. Then they find out that she is alive and a real old lady, living in a home for the insane. She seems to be very familiar to the boys. She's got a little baby and they must decide whether to take it with them and face the world as a father or keep it with her.   When she comes to, the girls are so terrified of her that they have to lock themselves in a room while she cries herself to sleep. When they are finally able to come out, they discover they've all been playing a horrible game.  There is nothing real about her except for her age and her old ways.  The kids must take their clothes off and perform in a game that is based on the old witch's games. The girls have to take their dolls off and put them in a basket and then put a doll on top of the basket with a doll at the top of it.  It is a game they have all been in before and they are playing it without knowing what is really going on.  If the movie had not turned out that bad and there had been more humour then maybe it would have worked as a little movie for a little while.  When the kids come back from their game, the old woman has become very angry and they have got themselves in very deep trouble.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Lolita" is a great film. I really like the movie and it is a good story that was told well in this movie. The girl who play the little girl is really cute. She do not want to be a "Lolicon" and is so gentle with the little guy (the doll) and so cute. When she tells the boy that he is not a "lolicon", the boy is so angry and is about to beat her up. But a wise lady steps in and tells him about a girl in the book who was also called Lolita and she had a nice body and that the guy in the movie is a bad man. So he becomes nice and loves the little doll and does not want a man to touch him. Lolita is not only a good heroine, but she is a nice character and a nice story to be told.    A couple of things I wish we could have in the film:  -The little girl was really cute when she play with the doll, she played with the other dolls too, but this girl had a bigger chest then the others.  -When the girl is sitting on the tree and she see the little boy with the big dick, she tell him not to be mad and then he is like "yeah ok?".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... It is a movie that made me think about the life of one of my ancestors, my great great great grandfather. I was also intrigued by his struggle and his perseverance as he tried to overcome great obstacles, to keep the family together, to go to war and not to return to his home, to stay in a foreign country and to stay a bachelor as well as his wife, and to be a good father to a family. The ending was a nice one, too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a fan of the original "Star Trek" series. It was one of the first series I ever watched when I was a kid. So when "Star Wars" came along I couldn't help but be fascinated. When I saw "StarTrek" a little over a decade later I wasn't surprised to see so many similarities with "StarWarrior" but at the same time I was more than happy to see a show like "Starwars" get the adaptation treatment it deserved. The actors are good, the story is interesting and the effects are great. And when they start bringing back the original trilogy characters and new ones and telling old stories it gets quite interesting.   "StarWars" might not be for everyone but it's a good, if somewhat silly, movie.

This is a good film to watch and to laugh at. There's some humor and action that makes you forget the pain and hurt. The scenes are realistic and you should not forget the scenes in the hospital. The film is great for those who love the movies like my sister did. It was also fun to watch the film with her.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was quite disappointed with this movie. It was a remake of a movie called 'Taken' in which James Dean and Dean Martin were the leads. Dean Martin is quite bad as well as the remake. The actress who plays a pretty woman is really a pretty bad actress. The two leading actors are just not good enough for this remake and the acting is not good at all either. The movie was quite bad at least when you first sit down and see it. After the first ten minutes I stopped expecting any good movie. The only good thing I found in this movie is the ending of the movie, but that was only because it was all so short, but it was a pretty long ending and that made it OK. It is a bad movie that just made you say how bad a movie could be.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What does "A Good Day to Die Hard" have that so many other action movies have not?   The best of the new action movies released so far this year (I'm not counting the remake).   This is one of those action movies that will keep you coming back for more.   It's a combination of good, action and a little bit of romance.  The action is quite good for a small budget (only $45,000) and it's all done so well that you hardly notice it is going on.  You are watching a bunch of guys go through the roof of a building.  This movie had me cracking up at the end when the SWAT officer (Kevin Pollak) shoots a terrorist. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Saving Private Ryan" is a superb World War II film with a fascinating cast of actors.   As an experienced naval officer I was immediately drawn into the story as I wanted to see what a naval battle would look like on land.  I found that the film captured the feel of a World War 2 naval war as if we were watching from the front lines. The pace of the story was slow, the action exciting, and the acting was superb.  What really caught my attention however was the plot. The action was well paced, there was action everywhere, and while there is not a lot of detail it is clear from the film's plotline that this was one of the biggest battles of WWII.  "The Battle of the Atlantic" is an excellent film and should appeal to movie fans and history buffs alike.   A great film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was made in the same studio as "The Wizard of Oz".   My husband said that this movie had a lot of "magic", "magic".  The story is about the old people of a village.   Their names were "The Witch of Baskerville", and "The Rake", and there are no more than a few who are left.  But these two old people are able to perform a spell that makes a tree grow from the ground. They set it up near a road that is about to get blocked by an ice truck.  Then the old witches and the Rake take a young girl to the tree, and when they are done with her they throw her into a lake.  The young girl gets up and walks home.  So this young girl is very sad.  When she walks past a house she notices the sign, and looks up and sees a little child there.  She goes in and it turns out that the little boy is the witch's son.  There is a scene at the end where he shows the little girl where he can find his mother's grave.  I did not see the girl when she got home, but I can assure you that she was a very sad little girl.

The kids are all weird and mischievous, and have a lot of fun. This is a fun movie to watch with your friends, and it's great that the kids are the main characters.   The music is good. It feels like this movie is a mixture between "Hooked on Monkey" and "Super Mario Bros." The main characters are like all the characters in these movies, but they're more unique, and they do interesting things with the ball.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, it was the film in which "the baddest bad guy of the whole cinema" (if there is such a thing) got his revenge on the good guy and the bad guy also got his retribution and so on. I have never seen such an evil villain before. He is absolutely vile and his voice is the only thing I can think of that could possibly make him even more loathsome. If you want to see the baddest villain ever, then do NOT see this movie and go out and buy another copy to burn. It's like watching a sick and twisted serial killer. All I can say is that I hope the good guys win because this film is just...   Not worth a single drop of blood.   The acting was ok but the effects were absolutely disgusting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - "The Godfather," by Francis Ford Coppola, directed by Mario Puzo, filmed in Italy and France in 1976.   An adaptation of the Francis Ford  Coppola novel "The Young Pope," with the title character playing the title role.  The movie has a fantastic mix of humor, violence and melodrama, the latter being particularly evident in the two "love scenes" between the priest and the young girl (who later turns out to be his daughter, as she later appears as a student at the Jesuit school where she has been transferred after the murder of her father).  The plot is a bit convoluted, however, to be able to be made "interesting."   A classic movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember this movie quite well. My father, a man who has never watched a film and doesn't understand them, thought this was a fine film. His opinion is certainly not the only one I would like to give this film.   A young man is playing in a bar with a friend. The friend is a nice young man. The young man likes a girl named Linda who he is fond of. The two friends have a love affair.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic!   It had a great plot, and a great cast of characters.   This is a classic film.  A movie I watched many many years ago.  It was one of the films that really inspired my future writing career.  When i got my hands on it in high school and tried to watch it again a few years later, i was amazed how good it looked.  I got the film on DVD a couple of years ago (my very first DVD), and i've watched it often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is well thought out. The movie plays on a number of ideas. The first one is a story about a man who goes into the country and becomes a slave.   The slave is played by Jeff Bridges.  As far as I can tell, Bridges is a pretty good actor. He doesn't have a lot of lines, but he can do a little bit of everything.  He is very nice and very easy to like.  I enjoyed seeing him do this one character so much.  The main story is about a little girl who has to be rescued.  She is a slave and has been through a lot.  Her father was killed in a tragic accident.  When her father dies, she becomes a mother to this little boy who has no father.  This boy has no daddy and little mother.  To make matters worse, the little girl's mother is a woman who is obsessed with her own husband.  There are some other things going on here, but it is not too bad a movie.  Overall, this is a very nice movie. It does some good things and some bad things.  "I can be a mother!" "She was a good-looking one."

It was fun, it was fun the way it was written, it gave you a lot to look forward to.   This is one of those movies that makes you wish you were in the theater.  The acting was great and the movie itself was very well done, I was looking forward to seeing the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a few good aspects of this film, namely, the film seems like a dream sequence, one of my favorite types of sequences in cinema, and in this case, the dream sequence in this film is very well done, it has all the elements needed to make a great dream sequence: dream sequences where you are alone in a dream world that seems to be an endless spiral, the use of music, a little bit of dialogue, and a bit of science.   It also has some great visual effects, such as the dream spirals and the clouds in the sky, and even some good special effects, like the glowing trees and the snow man's face.  I was especially impressed by the scene where the snowman's face gets covered in ice.  In conclusion, this film can be considered one of the best dream sequences I have ever seen, and if I ever saw it again, I would definitely watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just had to write a review for this movie. This movie is about a couple of teens who run away from their suburban house one afternoon to go see a movie. What follows is some great movie-making. The first half-hour or so is quite funny. We see the couple at the movies. They laugh and sing along. Then the movie gets a little creepy. I love the idea of a couple being in a movie theater and watching a film and not really understanding what's going on. We have a few funny bits, but nothing too bad. Then we see a man who is clearly going to kill them. When they run away they meet a young girl who gives them a ride to a place she doesn't like. When we go back there is no sign of them. Then some creepy stuff happens. The girl is taken by a man and we learn that her name is Tanya. When she asks to go to the house she is taken to a house where a guy is getting out of a truck. When the girl goes in to see what is going on we see the same old "creepy movie" in reverse. She is shown with the guy (and some other guys) inside a truck that is moving along a road. When Tanya is shown to a couple she's asked if she's had a good time, to which she answers "yeah I've had a nice time" and then she goes into a car with a guy. They ride around for a while and then we see that she's not in the car. I don't know about you, but that sounds a lot like the movie "The Thing", where a girl, the protagonist, gets into a truck and is later seen on a boat. This was so fun! I think I like "the guy" better, but the two teens really make it up to this couple. I'll go see it again.    (From a review written a couple years ago)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. I like how the story keeps you on your toes. It is kind of like the story of a "good movie" with a bad ending. I do wish there were a little more dialogue. I think that would have made it even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story has a lot of promise but also lacks a lot. We have to assume that there is an alien species on this planet that were in some way evolved to survive on a planet full of water and vegetation, but unfortunately the water is toxic and the vegetation is covered in vines and other plant material that have no problem with the toxic water. When a few of these alien creatures are forced to leave their planet because of the poisonous water the natives of this planet come into existence and soon they discover the toxic plants and the toxic animals in a land that is very dangerous to them. As the natives begin to adapt and to find a way to survive the alien invaders come back to the planet. We are treated to a battle between the two alien species. We learn a little more about their race in a fight that has very little logic to it, but it has some fun moments.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this film. I also liked the way the actors played it.   The plot is straightforward. The "good guys" are trying to protect the country and "bad guys" want to destroy it. It's a little dry at times, but I thought it was an enjoyable romp through the countryside. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of the Alien films you will be happy that the new one is a good film. It is still a good horror film even with the poor effects and some of the effects are quite laughable, which does not surprise me too much. However the creature design is excellent and is very creative. It gives a nice feeling of tension and fear. The acting is also very good.   You can buy the DVD or buy the blu-ray at the link below: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A classic."   - IMDB   My son has always been in awe of me, and he has been so since he was little. When I was in the 2nd grade (still a child at the time) I was asked if I wanted a ride to a movie theatre. I said "Yes," and so he said: "Well, I'll bring my lunch"   That was about 15 years ago and he would be the first to admit it.   He went to a number of movies growing up and even became a big Star Wars fan (which is totally crazy because I am not a Star Wars Fan)   However, he was never really into Star Wars. He had seen some of them as a kid but never a movie he would watch as a teen.  He is a big kid though, a 6'4'', 235lbs. So he has had to watch the movies a lot of the time.  When my son and I started seeing Star Wars movies again a couple years ago, he said to me that he had not been able to see these movies in a while, so we decided to make a visit to see The Empire Strikes Back.  He was excited.  We sat in the theater and were given free popcorn (yes, free) for our great showings.  But as he and I left the theater, we got an interesting offer: The two men who sold us popcorn had a deal for us. They offered me $1.00 to sit in the seat directly behind them.  So we did, but I wanted to sit somewhere else.  I couldn't get my son to sit with me in that spot.  It wasn't until a few months later that I went to my local theater and discovered that there were two seats in that row that were free for any one sitting in them. My son didn't want to sit there.  Anyway, I had never seen Star Wars until recently. We saw it this past Tuesday night.  While I love Star Wars, there are some aspects about this movie that I was not a big fan of. There are a few things that I liked (like the cool space battles and the movie, which I liked a lot), but there are a lot things about this film that I really didn't like. One of the problems with the Star Wars is that a lot happens in the movie. If a guy comes into the Jedi Temple and has a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a bit skeptical about this movie. I think it was one of the worst movies I've seen. It was funny at times and it was a very good movie for a laugh but for the most part I had trouble enjoying it. I felt the movie was going to be a bit too good at some points and it wasn't a good experience. It reminded me of a good old American road movie. The story was decent. They used the "I'm a Bad Man" song as an opener to the movie which wasn't bad, but at times was too much. The movie did a lot of things right. Some of the actors were really good. A couple of the movies the movie used were funny. The ending to the film was very nice. However, for the rest of the movie it was just very lame.   It was just a movie that was so bad I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I wasn't able to enjoy it at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few days after the release of a film called The Man Who Would Be King I attended a screening of The Man in the Iron Mask. I have no idea why this movie had to be made and how long it took to make but at least now I know why it's so good.   The film takes place in a small Austrian village in 1900, and follows the life of a wealthy, charming but lonely man who loves a maid named Anna, and her family. As the movie progresses the plot thickens. The man grows to have a violent temper, and his brother and nephew find it hard to control him. Anna is a spoiled brat, her father is sickly and her sister is a very spoiled bratt. She always has a new dress ready and always looks elegant. One day she's in a hurry to go to an opera performance, and by the time she gets there her brother and niece have gone.  Her father comes to get her and he's already in a bad temper and he has a gun.  One of the neighbors calls him off, but Anna tells him he can't let the whole family go to the opera.  It is the last scene of the movie that really makes you laugh out loud.  The man is talking to the servants when he realizes that Anna and the other maids had all been spying on him.  So he tries to have some fun by playing pranks on them, but he learns that the maids can't be fooled and the one he had been messing with is the real spy.  He comes out of the closet and finds that his wife is already dressed up and ready to go.  A big surprise.  When he tries again, his sister arrives and the man tells her that he loves her.  She is happy.  In one final scene of this film the man's son has just come home from school and he is excited to meet his dad.  Anna comes out to meet him, but instead of the two having a good time together she has a big confrontation with her father about her being gay and his not accepting of it.  What a funny story.  I had no idea that people had a sense of humor in the world at that time.  This is the kind of movie that will really have you smiling at the end of the film, so watch out for that ending.  My rating for this movie is a 5/5. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My second trip to Seattle was in 1995, when I was 17 years old. It was a beautiful afternoon in the city of Seattle, the weather was perfect, and I was looking forward to seeing the movie "The Matrix" again.   The movie was a surprise for me, and it was a spectacular experience.  The film tells the story of Neo (Wu Jing), a street kid who decides to become a cyber warrior. He does not do it easily, and even though it seems to be easy for him, he is not easy to control. He takes his mission seriously, even when he is being harassed by thugs. He is soon discovered by Morpheus, a computer system administrator. Morpheus tells Neo to destroy the Matrix and save humanity.  Neo does so, and he and Morpheus are able to go to heaven after the battle. Neo is able to use the computer, the machines, and the red pill that Morpheus gives him. He was able to achieve a lot and he is able understand the truth about his purpose in life. He decides to live in a quiet life with Morpheus. However, Morpheus is not the good guy he makes him out to be. Neo's mother had a little accident, and they must find her a job.  I liked how the movie presented a complex view of man and life, where you don't see the bad guys as villains.  Some scenes were very good, and others were a bit disappointing.  One scene I especially liked is that where Neo and Morphese go to the school where Neo is going to study, and Morphi is there to protect him. I think that when you watch the movie, you have to decide, do you think that Neo is just a computer hacker?  I thought so. I was reminded of "A Clockwork Orange", and the thought of Neo as a cyborg reminded me of the movie. That movie is very important to me, too, and "The Age of the Cyber" should have been very close to it in terms of its message.  However, I am still trying to understand if this is a good or a bad movie, and if it is a movie with some good or bad ideas. If we think of "The Cyber" as the Matrix, this film might be in the latter group. This is the second movie in the Matrix trilogy, so we have a bit of a different perspective. I still think it is very good. However it might
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie so much! It has been a while since I've seen an American thriller about a serial killer and I was happy to see it.   The plot was good, but the acting was just OK.  The film is so violent and gory and really puts the viewer into the scene and it was very shocking.  I liked the movie more than I liked some other horror movies I saw recently.  There is a scene in which a policeman finds a dead body in a dumpster. The guy who killed this man was a very good killer, he had an idea of what he wanted to do and he did it. When I was watching the film, I found myself asking myself why he did this to this poor guy. Was this a good way to go and what could he have done to prevent his arrest?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is a great one, and I think it would work in a lot of other genres. I'd even say that it is a thriller, in that it presents a story that would work nicely as a story in a thriller novel. It is set in the United States, but there is a lot about this story that I would be happy to see in other countries. I think that it would be a very good book to read to children. I like the idea of a person who has seen a murder, and who gets a second chance. I have to admit that I am surprised at how well it is written. I could only think of a few ways that this could have been a good story, and it didn't do any of them well.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hugh Hefner, one of the most influential American media moguls, has an important role in the lives of a woman, a teenage girl and an old man.   Hef is a successful man who is not too keen on a young woman named Candy.  She is his girlfriend, her only girlfriend.  Her father is very wealthy and a famous director.  He has had a lot of sexual relationships with women in his past and Candy is just one of his young lovers.  In a sense, his role in her life is more important than his personal relationship with her.  But he does not let that stop him from using her in a sexual way.  The first time they do this, they do it at the Playboy Mansion.  Then it is time to meet a woman who is an editor at the magazine called Penthouse.  It is not a sexy magazine.  There is no nudity or sex.  So how does he react when he sees a naked woman doing a sex act on a table?  Well, he thinks, "I have just made a great decision."   And he makes a few more great decisions in his life.

It is a documentary about the lives of the first responders, all of whom were overcome with emotion by the events that took place that day.   I found it to be a very emotional and powerful movie, as I found those that witnessed the events to be.  A very well written story with a great cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I would like to give the filmmakers a HUGE thank you for trying out a different kind of horror genre, but the movie does not quite hit its stride as the title suggests. This movie is definitely scary, and is not afraid to go full out, but there are times when I was pretty bored, especially in the first half. But I did find myself looking forward to more of this film.   This movie takes place in a world where we have people who can manipulate their DNA and alter their appearance to change themselves into a variety of creatures. However, these creatures have become "unholy" to their human masters.  They also have the ability to do anything, including murder people in cold blood, and even turn into people.  What makes the movie so good is that the humans, and their allies, and enemies, are not the only characters we learn about. There are also animals and plants, and this movie is a perfect blend of horror and comedy.  The writing is absolutely superb, it is really good, and really funny.  A number of characters are also pretty funny, especially the leader of the humans who seems to be the only one not in the movie because he can't control his powers.  So in essence, it takes a very weird, yet fascinating look into the strange world of humans who are changing themselves into different creatures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "My new favorite movie is... Star Wars: A New Hope. The original Star Wars is the most underrated movie in the entire series. I watched it on a plane from LA to Seattle on a flight that was delayed for over an hour. The whole trip was very entertaining and interesting. It had a very different story from the original, but it was still great. The first hour of the movie was great. It just got better from there. I love how they changed the old Rebel Fleet and added a bunch of new characters and locations. I thought the ending was cool. The best part was Han Solo and Chewie on the Falcon. There is a really good scene between Han and Leia at the end of the film. She seems to be jealous of his friendship with Luke, but I don't think she is. I also loved the appearance of Chewbacca. My favorite thing about this movie is how it was filmed. The cameras were very clean and the effects were spectacular. I can only hope the special edition comes out soon!"

Other than that, the whole cast were very good, except for the annoying guy who said some things that sounded funny but really weren't. The movie starts out like a horror movie. We all have heard stories about how people will go to great lengths to be invisible, and the invisible man is no different.

The story is well developed, and most importantly is not boring. It is a story with a strong character. The movie has a very interesting plot. There is not one moment of uninteresting plot, which is quite remarkable. The action is really good. The ending is pretty cool. It's a little bit over-the-top in a way. But I can't fault it too much. The performances are very good, too. It may be a little annoying at times to hear the same person speak the same line in a different accent, but that's probably not a bad thing.

The best part of the movie were some of the parts when the movie was bad but some of them were pretty good and i was enjoying them. It does kind of feel like the whole time there were people there just to make a bad movie. This is why it is kind of hard to review this movie because it kind of got mixed reviews but overall it did not make me feel bad to have seen it. I recommend this to a fan of horror movies but not to someone who is going to really enjoy it.

There is no sense of wonderment in this movie; we just know what's going to happen and how to get to that scene, and that's about it.   The movie also ends pretty abruptly. It's hard to explain exactly what's wrong with this movie, because it's not that much. The problem is that the entire movie is basically a series of boring action scenes that aren't very interesting.

The story is fun and interesting. The humor has good timing and never gets old.  This is a family comedy that will leave you giggling every time a random moment of humor takes place.  I would recommend this to my friends who like to laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot. The only downside I can think of is that it is very long. The last 5 minutes have a really cheesy soundtrack and a very bad ending. But, still, this movie is an entertaining little horror flick.   This movie was very well made, but I couldn't get past the last few minutes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie from a local Blockbuster. I knew about this one a long time ago but only just went to see it. I loved the look of this movie and the music is perfect. I don't know how they made it like this but I am glad they did! It's about a man and his dog (I think it's a dog) and his wife and the crazy old lady on his ranch. It's a funny and good movie. It was not too long and I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great film! It's a very funny and enjoyable film. It was great. I also enjoyed how it didn't focus on the characters but instead focused on the story.   It's hard to tell why, but the film felt so real, that's why I liked it. I wouldn't say it's a "great" movie, but it's an entertaining one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised when I first heard that it was about a guy who made an old farmhouse his home. When I saw the movie, I thought this was a lot of fun and it is. And it has some great action scenes, the way people were shot and how they reacted and were caught is funny. I thought the soundtrack was excellent and it had the classic movie soundtrack that I liked. But it wasn't the best movie I have ever seen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie numerous times but had to re-watch it today after a couple of days. This is not your normal action movie. No one is going to get killed this time. They are trying to be real heroes. This movie reminds me a little bit of John Carpenter movies where everyone is fighting to save the world.   This film is actually about a man who is obsessed with dinosaurs. But then something goes wrong. This film may be a "monster mash" but its a lot of fun!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an animated film about a monkey (the name means "little monkey") and his mother who live in a large monkey house in the middle of a jungle in Peru. There are various creatures that live in the jungle and occasionally a big ape named Lolo comes to the house. Lolo is an evil being. He is a big, black ape. He uses his big paws to eat the food and then he goes through the house and gets the food. The monkey mother is the most important part of this film. When the monkey mother goes to work, the other monkeys are a little sad about her departure. They start to get a little cranky, but then one day the monkey mom comes back and everybody is so excited. They want to give her a hug but the mother tells them that they should be patient with her. The movie really begins after the mother leaves and there is a monkey who wants to be a baby but who wants his mother more and more. He tells his mother that he will never go to a zoo or a big zoo like the one in America. The mother then tells him that he must go to America and he must come to a big monkey house. He tries hard to do this and even gets to live in an American house but it gets too hot in there and then one of the monkeys decides to blow up the house in anger. He has to go back home and then goes to school and begins to learn about people. He likes to be with his brother and his dad but the father is always away. The father loves his son but is often away and then this monkey feels that he is lonely. So he tries to go to his dad who is a scientist and wants to show him a way to make baby monkey babies. The scientist is a crazy man who is always traveling to other parts of the world. The son and his father have to wait until the scientist arrives to see what he has planned. But they get the news about this. Now the mother and son are happy again.   I have not seen this movie in the theater. I have seen it online and it was good. The animation is great. It had a beautiful color pallete. I really enjoyed it.  It would be better if it had an English dub but it would be a good film if the English dub was good as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't really have a whole lot of expectations for this movie after the trailer for it made me cringe a little bit. So I was pretty skeptical about whether or not I'd like it or not. It was a bit like the film "The Perfect Storm" in the sense that it was a combination of a couple of real life events, a couple movies, and some things you just kind of have to watch in a short period of time.   While there were some moments that had me on the edge of my seat, the overall plot of the movie isn't very impressive at all.  It does however do a decent job of depicting what it's like to live with depression and I really liked that they gave you a little more backstory for some of the characters.  In fact, while the character's aren't very well developed, there was a lot of little details that really made them come alive.  I also really liked the movie because it had a sense of humor to it that I haven't really seen in a lot lately.  This movie was definitely worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't want to go in depth with the story. The only thing I will say is that I love the ending. It was great. The movie had so many great scenes. I also liked how the camera got to experience something the world doesn't often see. The sound was not bad.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, I'm going to start by saying that I was never a big fan of the 80s and early 90s horror films. I never understood why the genre was so popular and people kept watching the films with such enthusiasm. So when I heard that the new "Halloween" was in development I was very intrigued. I had to see it because I saw the trailer and thought "Oh my God, it's scary as hell! I just had an entire day that was filled with terror!" It seemed like it had the best of all the 80's horror films combined with the best horror of the last 15 years (not including Scream and a few others). The best thing about "Halloween" was the acting. They were all so convincing that you almost forgot that the film was in 3D and that the atmosphere was actually scary. You didn't want to turn away or run for safety. They did everything they could to make you feel sick and creeped out. Some scenes were pretty gruesome. The music, especially the bass was so good, you couldn't even look away. The effects were so believable that you wondered how a real human could survive a night in the woods with just a little makeup on. They played off each other so well that it was hard to believe that this was a film shot in one take. The best part was that it wasn't overly scary. It had a little more humor to it than the others, but it kept it grounded and really made it scary.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie I saw this weekend at the Cinema Royal, was a little strange and a little scary. I liked the movie, although the ending was a bit weak. However, I really liked the concept and the direction. The sound was not bad either, and the action was decent. But the ending made me want to throw up a little. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a woman (Jennifer Aniston) who has a crush on a boy (Tom Hanks).   He's a loner, in my opinion.   It's sad to see a movie about such a man.  He had to work to make himself look presentable so his family and friends wouldn't think he was gay.  And he did that by dressing a lot better than he really is.  What is he in the mood for?   Jennifer Aniston   "I'm a lesbian" I love that she's a lesbian.  I loved that she was a lesbian, but it was sad that she couldn't make a relationship with someone.  This is such a lame movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first time seeing a horror movie. This is a great movie. I loved the movie and I have seen a few others now but this one really hit the spot for me. The horror theme is not overplayed, there is a good amount of gore and blood and some scary moments. I love that they took a horror classic and turned it into a good horror movie! I loved every second of it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It has so many things going on. The character development is strong and you can feel a lot of emotion going through every one of their characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, it's so hard to write about something that you don't know a lot about (not to mention, the film is not very good). I only watched the trailer (and the English dubbed version with English subtitles, which isn't that bad by the way) and it looks like a generic action movie, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. It is actually a very good movie with a good story line.   I'm surprised, I don't think I'll need to write anything about the plot, but anyway, I thought the story line was pretty good: a girl named Alanna (the best actress I've ever seen) gets attacked by a demon that can go into people's minds, and it starts messing with her mind and causing her to act differently. When her brother (Chris) saves her, he discovers that she was able to destroy it, but he then starts to get obsessed with it, and is like "oh no, not this time!" but then he finds out that he and Alanna have a special relation. And you know, this movie can be quite strange at times and the plot can be a little confusing (it's like a reverse of the story in "Ghost World", except the characters seem more human than those in the film), but I think the actors and actresses really pulled it off and were able to make me laugh a lot and, of course, enjoy it a little.  So the plot is that a girl goes on a trip and is attacked by an evil demon and then wakes up in a room full of zombies (the "soulless" part of the demon is revealed, I think) and her brother is like, "Oh, I guess I've done something stupid."   It's a little bit slow-paced at times (it takes a few episodes to find out everything, but it's a good pace, no?). The plot is pretty good though, and I definitely recommend this film, especially if you like horror films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very much a 'Dune' movie, to an extent that I can't really get enough of it. I mean, there's some very cool action scenes, and the cast is all great in the role, but what really makes this a great movie is the setting, and some very well thought out plot. I really don't think I need to say much about this, except that I really like the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Best Horror Movie of All Time" - Michael Biehn    5/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an awesome film! I just want to take a moment and thank Tom Cruise for making such a fun film! As the title suggests, the film is based on the real life events that followed the events surrounding the sinking of the RMS Titanic.  I love the idea behind this film. This is a fun and good movie.   The cast does a nice job in making you forget about what really happened during those horrible events.  The music is very good and fits the movie perfectly.  You will also find some very funny moments during the film.  Cruise does a good job playing the captain of a very ill ship.  At times, you may find yourself smiling at Cruise as you realize he is really good at what he does.  My only complaint is that the ship is a little too large for the actors to really make the ship feel real.  That being said, I think this is a pretty good movie and I think it would make a great gift for a big crowd.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is well done. The director made his own ideas and created an intriguing and engaging story. There were some good characters, most of them were developed well, some were weak, but that's what made them interesting characters. It didn't really have much action, but it did have it's humor. It had a good plot, very well executed. The performances were a little wooden, but then again most of the movies are a little lifeless.    The last thing I want to talk about is a great action sequence.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a solid thriller, with a great cast of memorable characters and a great story to go along with it.   The story is set in the city of Bruges in Belgium, and takes place in the period of the rise and fall of a powerful mafia.  They have a group of men who are experts in smuggling contraband from Italy to England.  These are mostly Italian criminals who steal and smuggle things and are very good at it. Their ship is intercepted by the British navy and they are taken prisoner, and taken to Brugese prison where the king and queen are on the run.  They are taken to a house where they are placed in cellars and left to rot.  The plot progresses as the story progresses and the king becomes increasingly involved in a conspiracy that his wife is involved in.  Then the king is poisoned by a fellow prisoner and the plot seems to come to a head.  A mysterious woman is sent to retrieve a necklace from a girl called Christine.  And Christine meets a priest who takes her back to the convent to live with him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is not without its flaws and has some really poor acting but it does have some great characters that the film is so strong in.   I also enjoy the ending, which is not in the film but in a book by the same name.  The movie also has a very strong ending, but the book version is better.  The film opens up with a scene showing an old man with his son talking about their father and how he loved him:    "He was the one who never gave up on him, even when things were not looking good, even though he thought his son was a terrible son to have."   This is all well and good, but it doesn't end there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes place in the future and you can see the future as well. The story takes place about 25 years in the past. It is about a man and his wife who are both in their early 30's. They work at the same place and are very happy. They just have a few extra chores to do. They own a small ranch which is located in the middle of nowhere. They go camping a lot and just do nothing much. It all ends when their neighbor, Mr. O'Hara, comes over to their ranch and decides to take it over. They have no idea what he is talking about at first but he makes it seem like a good thing. He keeps talking about how they need to have more cattle and he has a new bull. When they get back, the bull is gone. His bull! The neighbors comes over and says that they were wrong to turn it over and that they should stay and work. He goes on and on about how everyone needs to work and all the rest of it. He even offers to give them the cattle to use if they like it. I didn't like him much at all because it made no sense to me at all. He just kept talking all kinds of nonsense and then came the last 20 minutes or so where it all got very silly. The last part of the movie made me laugh my head off. I thought it was all just a little over the top. But, I must say that I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that this movie is really entertaining for the first 5-10 minutes.

I just wanted to see what could be achieved in a movie based on a short story and the movie delivers. My son would probably like to see this movie.

They just love each other and go on playing, and this movie is such a beautiful film. This is a fantastic film that is full of joy and laughter.

The streets are littered with drug dealers and prostitutes.  The young residents have a strong sense of moral code.  Most of them are hard workers and they are dedicated to their jobs.   They are in a constant state of fear of being killed because of the gangs that make a living by taking money from the drug dealers.  When a young girl is shot, a young boy takes it upon himself to find out who did it. He soon realizes that his mission might not be as simple as he imagined.

This movie is a movie that really captures a scene in a movie and I thought that the actors were really great and they got the scenes right and it made me laugh out loud every time!   The movie starts off pretty funny but then I saw that the next scene was just really bad. Then the movie goes to some other movie that was just so bad I felt like I was watching a really bad movie. The next scene is a scene that really made me feel like an idiot every time and I could not understand the action scenes and I am thinking to myself how can this movie get made. Then I saw a movie about the mafia and that movie was pretty good but when I watched this movie I just felt like watching a movie with terrible acting.

The acting is strong from most of the actors, and the movie is really well produced, and it is well acted.   "It was the first movie I ever went to that had a female lead. " It was an interesting story about a girl named Susan who discovers a secret that will change her life forever. She is a teenager who is an excellent swimmer and has a secret about her which her parents are never going to discover. The movie starts in a small town when Susan meets the guy that her parents were going to pick up, and as she tells the story he is listening to a tape recorder and watching a video tape of a woman, his sister, who is drowning. After the incident with her brother and a girl, she has a crush on this guy and when he asks her to go back to her hometown for a weekend to visit her parents, Susan has to decide if she is going to go through with this relationship she has and risk her brother's life, or stay with the guy she doesn't want to get a wrong idea about. Susan and the guy don't last very long because Susan has other plans about the weekend which involve going to a party, and also, a secret. It was very well written and acted, and very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Like most people, I was very interested in "The Day the Earth Stood Still," as I believe the movie is based on a novel by Robert A. Heinlein. The movie follows an astronaut as he lands on the planet Eros in this alternate world. The story unfolds as it does in most books and movies: Earth is at the end of a long time of peace, and all life has left the planet and made its home on Eros. The hero, called 'Earth' by the people of Eros, has a mission, and that mission is to find a place called 'Harmony' where the Earth people could live in peace, after all the wars and suffering had taken its toll. But when Earth's first spaceship, the 'Titan', arrives in the Eros system, Earth's situation is not all that optimistic. The people of Harmony are not as peaceful as Earth's, and are more violent and less interested in peace than Earth is. As a result, the people on Harmony are almost as aggressive as Eros' people. There is also a race of 'holograms' which are like people, but have no feelings or emotions. However, the Titan lands in Harmony. Although the ship's crew are not very happy to be here, they make up for it by helping Earth's people out. The two factions don't get along well and are fighting constantly, but Earth does get a big payoff. Earth gets off Eros and is on its way to Harmony to find out what has happened to its people. But the ship also finds that Harmony is going to be destroyed before it arrives. Then something happens which is one of the best I have seen in a film: Earth's spaceship is hit by a star-ship that crashes in front of the Titan. The crew find the pilot dead, and he appears to be in a coma. Earth is given the choice to take the body and try to fix the ship. The planet's crew then do, and they manage to repair the ship and bring it to Harmony. While they are trying to bring in the bodies of the passengers, they discover that they have all come back as ghostly 'hylons' - beings that are the people that have never really left the Earth in their body. They have not actually gone to Harmony, but are still on Harmony. One of the reasons why the people are so hostile is that they believe the 'hilon' are just

After all the publicity about the film's sequel, The Exorcist II (1987), I was eager to see what was happening next.  And it's good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a wonderful movie that keeps me entertained for the entire hour and a half runtime.     As soon as we are given a brief introduction, we begin with a montage of old people walking down a road, talking about how much the world has changed.  The narrator, a man in a suit and tie, tells us that everyone is wearing jeans now.  As we walk we notice a little girl running away from a scary clown.  And this is when the fun begins.  Some clowns are being chased down the road by another clown with a huge scythe.  This is the kind of fun you only get at midnight, with a creepy clown chasing his little girl away.  With a little help from our narrator, our little girl starts screaming about how bad she has to deal with the scyther.  So the clowns chase after the little girl.  It's an exciting sequence to say the least.  After all of this is done, our narrator tells us about an old man with a cane walking on the road.  He tries to warn the other clowns about the big scary guy.  He tells them how scared he is of this scary clown, but he is still too frightened to run away. Our narrator continues to tell us about the other children in the town.  They are all wearing clothes that cover their bodies.  Their hair is all knotted up.  Our narrator tries to reassure them that it will be okay, but then he remembers something.  There was a woman in the crowd who is not wearing a shirt.  She is the old woman in a big, white dress.  Then we see the old man walking on, with the same clowns chasing after him.  Just like the other kids, he is trying to keep calm by saying to his little daughter that this is just a cartoon.  But his little voice is telling him to run.  At the end of the montage the clown guy with a big scythere comes along and chases our clown with the big scythere.  When our clown tries to stop him, the old lady falls down in front of him, knocking him down as well.  That pretty much sums it up. The only bad part about this movie is that we spend a lot of time watching our little narrator trying to tell the old people to run, while our little clown is running away. I guess we could say that this

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, it was announced last week that a remake of the classic horror/horror comedy The Conjuring is in production at New Line Cinema. It is set to shoot starting in February 2017, with a release planned for November 20, 2017. The original film was directed by Terence Davies, and stars Vera Farmiga, Dan Stevens, Vera Farmigiana, Jessica Lucas, Matt Lucas, Bill Skarsgard, and Richard O'Brien.   The Conjure was directed as a spinoff from the novel of the same name, written by Linda Germain, which had been turned into a horror thriller and horror film. In the story, a woman is possessed by a demonic spirit and the only way to defeat it is to lock it away in a locked room. She does this by locking the door behind her and taking a small camera, with no battery, a flashlight and a camera assistant, and sets off for a haunted house with the aid of her camera assistant and a psychic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good film about a small community in southern California that was forced to relocate when a large portion of the city was leveled due to a major oil spill in 1969. (Some people like this movie. I didn't like it at all.)   The people of this community are extremely nice and friendly and you just don't care for them. It seems as though there is a conspiracy on the part of the government to kill people to keep this place clean for everyone else to move in.   At one point you think this might all be a figment of the writer's imagination until a police car pulls up and the owner tells the policeman that he thinks a man just walked into his restaurant. Then it dawns on you that this was a real man (actually a woman) named Marilyn, who had just escaped a mental hospital. She had lived here for 10 years after the mental ward there was bombed. But her husband took her to Los Angeles where he got a job at a diner. At first she felt pretty safe living here and didn't mind being around other people. But when her husband comes home drunk and abusive she does all she can to try and get him to take care of his children. This causes him to move out and move in with a woman he met on the beach. This woman doesn't want him around and won't let him see his children and the children of her family. So he starts to have a lot of problems and then the man who lived in this neighborhood was shot to death.  When a family friend is stabbed to death she gets in touch with a girl named Kim who has a sister who has gone missing. It turns out Kim is actually Marilyn's daughter and when Marilyn's husband comes back to town the girl starts to talk about a guy called Gary who lives in the next town over. Her husband is more than a little creeped out and doesn't say anything. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You might ask yourself:  This is a good story? This is what all those books that were made about a long time ago, what all these movies that were seen on TV, have been made about? Is this a movie like the one that was made on TV? This movie about a man who is looking for a job for the first time in his life, who meets a girl, a girl who is very beautiful, and falls in love with her, and is not able to find a job, for a while. The girl is looking out for him, trying to help him find a place to work, but he is not going to be able to. But after all, she is still the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. He is very lonely, as he never had a job to look for, never had an apartment to live in.   Then one day the guy comes across a sign saying 'The Golden Job' in front of a building, the building that had been in a great fire a few years ago. The guy decides to enter the building, and there he meets a beautiful woman. And that is the beginning of a love story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I decided to go see "Grow Up" this past weekend, and we were very impressed with the movie. It is a very good movie and well worth seeing. The movie is a parody of many old Hollywood movies that were made in the 1950's. It's a good laugh, very fast paced and with a plot line that makes sense. We watched the movie on a very long drive in a very large and empty parking lot. The audience was made up of mostly elderly people. There was quite a bit of laughter in the movie and many audience members got up to join the audience. I hope they put a movie like this on the cable channel and make it available in other cities. I know it's possible to make fun of the things we see in movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My friend and I sat in the theatre to see this movie. We both are fans of the Star Trek franchise. He saw the original series, and the later Star Trek TNG episodes, and I've seen all of them. When we walked into the theatre, we were both shocked. This movie was like nothing we had ever seen. It was beautiful and strange, and so much of what was good about it was ruined by poor acting. This made the whole movie bad. There was something about this movie, but I can't remember what. The cast looked great, and we both felt great empathy for Spock. I really wish he had gotten a chance to get into the transporter. We would have gotten to know one another, but Spock was not allowed into the ship. The rest of the ship looked amazing, with its many systems, and it was very realistic. It had all kinds of creatures on board, and they all looked real. There were no CGI creatures in this movie that I could detect. The creatures were realistic and looked like they were real. If you like science fiction, and you're in the mood for a good time, go see this. And I bet you'll like it. I think a lot of Star Trek fans would like it as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great in the way that it is set in the early 1950s. It's a good period piece about a family with a young daughter named Jane. It does have some dated jokes, but that's nothing new. This is another great film about a loving family with their own personal tragedy.   I like this movie because the father is a true role model.
