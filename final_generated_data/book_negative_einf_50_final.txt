Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of errors and misconceptions that I was frustrated. The book is filled with references to various sources about the origin of the Book of Mormon (e.g. 2 Nephi 9:13; 3 Nephi 14:5). But the primary source for these references is in a book called "The Book of Masonry." This book has been quoted at length throughout the book, yet is not mentioned once in the book itself. To this reader, it appears to be a reference to a different Book of Mormonism source, rather than an appropriate source for the Book Of Mormon. This book makes a number of claims about the origins of the Mormon religion, yet the source it references has nothing to do with the Mormonism that we know and practice today. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as part of my reading "Gifts of the Magi" series. It's good. Not really the best I've read but I liked it. It doesn't get a big enough read to get me to buy the others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like your books to be long, complex and filled with philosophical questions and speculation, and you like them to be written by philosophers (as the subtitle promises), this book is not for you.  For one thing, you get to read many of the same philosophers in this book over and over.  They repeat themselves with little regard to originality or meaning, or they write as if they are in a hurry to get their books out (as they often seem to do).  This is a major flaw in a book that is supposed to make you think about the meaning of life, and this flaw is compounded by the fact that the authors do not provide many of their own thought experiments and arguments to counter the philosophical problems they raise.  Perhaps they are aware of this problem, and they simply do not try very hard to find them.  On the other hand, the authors are not totally inattentive or uninterested in philosophical issues.  This seems to be their primary goal, and the book's arguments have been well thought out and well argued.  I will certainly be keeping an eye on the book, as it is likely to be an influential contribution to the debate about the role of philosophy in modern life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really thought I would find a good story that would be interesting in some way.  Sadly, it turned out to be a very bad read.  The author really seems to have a hard time finding stories that are good.  In this one, he just sticks with the same old clichéd stuff.  He makes it seem like the world is ruled by women because of some innate nature.  It's ridiculous.  There is no reason that men should rule over women.  That is simply a societal rule.  Women have been the only ones that are allowed to rule since the dawn of time.  Men have been trying to break away from women since the beginning of time, but every time they do, women fight back with all the strength and skill that they possess.  And women have a higher level of intelligence than men.  So what is the point of having a higher than average intelligence?  Why is it even necessary if men are supposed to be in charge?  I have never understood the whole point of feminism, but that's what this book says.  I'm not even sure if he really believes it himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a great deal of poetry and I found this book to be unoriginal and mediocre.  It is also so much about the American Dream and the values it embodies that it could not be a more negative, one-dimensional view.  This book is about how to achieve these values, not what the values are. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. I was disappointed that the author made claims that can't be supported with evidence.   There is no evidence that women can't become pregnant at the same time as men.  There are lots of references to the medical literature about women who gave birth while in menopause.  Even the medical associations don't recommend that women avoid all men and avoid pregnancy at all costs.  I understand the idea behind birth control, but the idea that women are unable to control their fertility if they use hormonal contraception (Hormonal birth control does have side effects, and there are other forms of birth control that are even more effective than the pill)  I find hard to believe 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was a little too close to a textbook on psychology, but it was too basic for my tastes. I'm sure that I could learn a lot about psychology from it, but not nearly as much as I could from a book by a good psychologist, like Carol Dweck. It was interesting to learn about the different models of emotionality that different psychologists have used, and how the different ideas have influenced our understanding of human emotion. In particular, it was interesting that the model that the authors of the book most aligned with was the one developed by John Bargh and Peter Roy. I thought that the book could have been more systematic, though. I would have liked more information on the many different ways in which we measure emotions, and on the differences in how we measure them based on the different ways that we try to understand them. This book could use more research citations, though, and I do wish that it was more well-written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading The Sorrows of Young Werther. I can understand why the book is on the list for most hated books of all time. It's a terrible piece of trash and I will probably never read it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most annoying thing about this book was the narrator.  He sounded like he was reading an ad for the New York Post.  I hate ads.  It's like they just come in and ruin the book for me.  I am not interested in reading about the downfall of an empire.  In this case, it is a bad empire. I hope someone in the future books has something interesting to say about the British Empire in India.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started reading this book with high hopes and high expectations. Unfortunately, they were not realized. The book is a mix of history, philosophy, and psychological analysis. The historical aspect is interesting and provides background information about the different civilizations throughout history. However, I found the philosophy and psychology to be repetitive. The author spends a lot of time discussing how people in ancient societies were motivated by fear, guilt, or anxiety (which is an understandable concern), but this does not seem to apply to the modern world. She gives very little examples from her own life to show how modern people behave and thinks, and I found it very annoying. The last half of the book discusses her theory of self-help as a means of coping with life's frustrations. I found this to be extremely superficial and, frankly, insulting. The authors claim to find solace in their philosophy of self help, but she spends a majority of the chapter describing her negative feelings about how people can get so stuck on their negative thoughts and feelings about their lives. If anything, the book is an affirmation of a very basic concept that all of us will experience in some way or another. However it does not offer any meaningful solutions or suggestions that might help you solve the problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written and the plot, which is very boring, is very contrived. There is no depth or interesting points made. It's a waste of time to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed reading this book. The theme of family values, loyalty and responsibility was intriguing and I found it easy to relate to. However, I found the story to be a bit too simplistic. The main character is a good, honest woman who has a husband and son who are good guys but get in her way sometimes. One time she got very angry at them for talking while she was at work and had to leave the office. A few days later she returned and found that her husband and her son had gone to a nearby movie. They had not even talked to her about it. They told her they were sorry and she did not want to hear any excuses. She had also heard them say that if they didn't get their act together they would leave. The woman had a strong sense of responsibility. So, she confronted them and told them what she thought of their attitude. When they asked her why she was so upset they told her that it wasn't their fault. It was their father. He didn't like her, but he still loved her. Then she had a difficult time getting her husband to stop talking when she was in the middle of something. He was always trying to take over. He did it to her mother and brother. Sooner or later, he is bound to get a hold of her. She finally found a solution when she told him she would no longer listen to him. It worked. It really did! It seems she finally got her dad to understand that she had her way of doing things. They've been married now nearly four years and they're still trying to figure things out. I'm glad I got to read this book and I will certainly give it another look in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book.  The writing is terrible.  All of the main characters are stupid and uninteresting.  They talk about random things in a boring manner.  No one who reads this book gets anything out of it.  This is a bad attempt at a memoir.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A really bad book. Not even the most egregious of errors can be blamed on the author. She gives us the most disgusting example of what feminism is about - the concept of having women "rule" over men. It was a very poorly written book. The whole thing reads like she's been talking to herself in a fever dream for years. She doesn't care one iota about the truth and she doesn't even bother to write a proper introduction. The book's title is the only thing that holds it together, but it's also a very, very bad book by a terrible author. It's the worst book I've ever read in a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, but found it so much more disappointing than interesting that I threw the book out.  This is a good book about children and how they view their parents.  But it's so much about children (and the parents) becoming too close, that the book doesn't come out at all interesting to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was pretty disappointed by this one. I've been wanting to read The Art of the Deal for a long time, but when the book came out a while ago, it was so terrible that I decided not to even try. But when I saw it was on the library shelf at my local library, I bought it. I enjoyed it. But there were a couple of things that bothered me about it.  One was that Donald Trump was portrayed as being a master deal maker. I really don't see that in his life.  His real success is the licensing of his name to real estate projects.  He doesn't own the buildings, he just licenses the name.  So he might be a good businessman in the real estate sense, but he's not a master deals maker in the sense of being able to pull a lot of strings and get a lot done.  Another was that the authors described what kind of things they had seen Donald Trump do as being "outrageous" and "dangerous."  This is what he's doing at the debates.  Trump's behavior at the debate is not at all outrageous.  It's actually something I'd expect him to do at an important event like this.  The authors claim that Trump's supporters are "racist," "bigoted" and that they "know the truth about Donald Trump."  I am very confident that I don't believe any of that stuff.  I know that I know the truth.  And my conclusion is that Trump is a good, decent man who makes bad decisions from time to time.  But I also know that he has been right about some things that I disagree with.  If you want to know the facts, you should look up the video of the first debate and see what he actually said about Muslims.   If you don't want to be lied to, read the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise is pretty simple, but it takes quite a while to come to terms with: a writer, whose main passion is cooking, decides to become a chef herself to make her love of the food she loves even stronger. The result is a book that's all too familiar in its lack of originality. The writing is bad enough to make the recipe choices seem predictable, and the recipe compilation makes for some cringe-inducing reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are no stories.   It's only about the author's life and what he went through.  There's nothing memorable about the life, nothing that might be relatable to me, even though he describes it.  It seems like a waste of a good book to have no story at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book, and more importantly, The Unbreakable Miss Lovely, to be utterly boring.  I had read these books, as well as A Life of Crime, several times, in the past, and I had always loved them.  Unfortunately, the latest book didn't live up to the others.  Miss Lovely is a great story about a troubled child, but there's little that will stick with me after I've read it four or five times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written with an unkind voice and is not worth the effort. The author uses his book for self-pity as well as to give us a pep talk on being a man. In the first half of the book he makes a pretentious claim of having no male friends and being a virgin in his twenties. He then goes on to criticize the many boys who are very much like him for their childish ways. Then he says something that shows he doesn't understand the concept of love. He says, "I can love a man even if he is a pedophile.   My heart can go out to a man like that. But I can't love my little daughter." He claims to be able to love his daughter, who is a virgin and has no male peers, and yet he has problems with this one person. Then the author goes on and describes the negative impact of modern life. He describes how people of different races and classes live under the same roof, so he can't even find a room in his own home. He talks about how people talk back to him and how others are mean to him for no reason. Then, he talks about his job and how he has to put up with a lot of rudeness. In his opinion, this is how we all should behave and why he lives with a pack of men. But at the end of the day, he goes back to his job, which is the reason why he doesn,t have any female friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no suspense in this book, no tension. I'm sorry, but there is no tension in this world or this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that most reviewers of this book have a difficult time with its contents.  While it can be used to examine a lot of cultural trends, such as the increasing popularity of the computer-generated video game, this book also presents an alarming view of the "cyberpunk" movement and its impact on society.  The book is written in the style of a "sociological survey," and is riddled with errors and factual errors.  For example, it states that "The rise of cyberpunk literature is one of the more dramatic developments of the last decade or two."  It is not; the movement was relatively new (in 1983) and only had a couple of books out at the time the book was published (Cyberpunk 1990: A Critical Appraisal of the Cyberpunk Movement ).  It also states that there are "frequently graphic depictions of violent crime."  This is true.  However, the majority of the crimes that are depicted are either "not especially violent" or, in one case, the author notes, "the actual crime was minor."  There are also times when the author states things that are not true and when they do, the book itself points out that they are not.  Another example is the author's claim that "the term 'cyber-punk' was coined by Robert Heinlein in 1959."  The term itself was used in the late sixties by John Perry Barlow and Robert Anton Wilson but did not originate until the early seventies.   The author is also incorrect when she states that "[the cyberpunk movement] is a movement, not just a genre."  In fact, a lot about the cyberpunk genre includes the notion that the computer itself is the "medium" through which information is exchanged and not the traditional books and bookshelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible. The main character, a woman who has been diagnosed with a personality disorder, has to be taken to psychiatrists to get treatment for her mental illness. The whole process is excruciatingly annoying and embarrassing. She is treated as a problem child rather than as a person who needs help. I'm going to put this book down until the main character gets the treatment she needs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is terrible. It's a very badly written story about a very unimportant subject. You don't get any emotional connection to the main character or any reason to believe anything he or she is saying. The book is only worth the paper it is printed on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book. I have enjoyed numerous contemporary works of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. But my tastes in science fiction have become increasingly limited. This is definitely on the more interesting side. As for the book itself, I am not a fan of the way in which it attempts to describe various aspects of the universe in a logical way. This has been the way for many science fiction writers since the days of H.G. Wells and Arthur C. Clarke. I found the discussion on time travel somewhat superfluous. However, I liked the plot and I think I may have a new favorite sci-fi novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is horrible. It is full of inaccuracies and factual errors.   The information contained in the first chapter is misleading, as it's based on information that's been proven to be false.  The second chapter is even worse, as is the third chapter. The fourth chapter is all "facts", and the fifth chapter is mostly "statistical factoids", without any actual substance.  For example:  "The average woman's period lasts about five days, while the average man's lasts about two days."  This is just one of many examples.  Another example is: "Nearly all women become pregnant every month."  I don't know of any studies or research that shows this.  This statement seems to come from someone who's never had a period, and I assume is a woman who is looking for a way to make herself appear more fertile.  I'm not even going to attempt to address the "facts" in the fifth and sixth chapters because I don�t know what those statements mean and I�d rather just ignore them.  Also, the author claims that most women get their period between the ages of 16 and 18. I guess that means that most men get their periods between 16 and 19.  No other age group is mentioned, so either that information isn't accurate or the author just made it up.  Unfortunately, the authors are only interested in making themselves look more attractive, not in actually giving accurate information.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't mind reading a good book. I have a few of them, but I find most of them have very little to say to my daily life. Not so with the one about my son, who was diagnosed with autism at age 2. He has severe sensory issues and is very verbal. This book describes his life and his struggles. The author explains to us all how a bad decision he made at the age of 3 led to his developing autism, how he was able to make it through life with the help of friends, and how he has coped over the years with his autism. It also describes the amazing opportunities he has had because of his autism and how those opportunities have changed the lives of others. I highly recommend it to anyone with an autistic child.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read and enjoyed this book, but there is too much of it.  I had to stop after 50 pages because I couldn't keep up.  The main character is an extremely unlikable guy who never seems to learn from his mistakes.  He's a rich, arrogant man who never does anything right.  It really becomes difficult to keep the reader interested when he doesn't seem to be learning from the mistakes he makes.  And this is after he does learn from them!  As the reader, I was frustrated and couldn't take it any more.  Too much plot, too much character, too many twists.  This is a bad choice of subject matter for a book that is supposed to be about failure, especially from an upper-class guy.  If a rich rich guy could get his way and make everyone else follow his way, I don't think it would be too difficult to convince people to do the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for an effective book about learning languages, but I found a book that I have been unable to read. The authors describe the grammar and vocabulary of several languages as they are used in everyday life: English, German, Dutch, and Chinese. The languages are used to describe everyday events. The grammar is clear, but the vocabulary seems to have been drawn from the dictionary. This book is not for the advanced student. For the beginner, this book will be hard to read, as it seems to me that much of the grammar used in the book is out of date. For anyone using the book, I recommend the use of a dictionary, which has a much wider scope and is more up-to-date.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am trying to get back into reading fantasy books and this one got the best reviews for the longest time.  When I finally finished it, I realized that the characters did not make a strong impression on me.   They were flat and annoying.  For some reason, they didn't even seem like real people.  The protagonist, who I thought was supposed to be an intelligent and capable woman, became almost a caricature when it came to interacting with others.  I feel like I am watching a bad reality show rather than reading a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title describes the book well and its style is a little too perfect. It describes the world in very precise details, in a very literary style, which I found very engaging. Unfortunately, the book's contents are anything but perfect. As I've said many times, the author doesn't actually say much about the world he's describing. While some descriptions are accurate and some aren't, there are a lot of inconsistencies. His descriptions are sometimes accurate and sometimes not, but he never really states what he's talking about at any point in the book. There are references to the history of the world but those references are often vague. This book is a complete mess and I don't understand why anyone would bother with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed the book, but I couldn't stand the character. The book is a great tale about what happens when one gets in over his head. Unfortunately, the author does not learn from his mistakes, and he makes a habit of repeating the same old mistakes. The ending is unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was just awful.  The plot is cliched, the characters are uninteresting, and the plot itself is ridiculous. I finished the book in one sitting, and only skimmed the back pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry I took so long to read this, but I think I am being spoiled. The book's premise is interesting but the execution is poor. The central characters are interesting but their inner turmoil is not explored at a depth that is believable.  The book begins and ends with the central characters in a heated debate about the meaning of life.  I understand the author's intent to present the argument but this doesn't make it any easier to swallow.  Although the book's author is a well-known academic and is therefore not completely without flaws, he is in this case, as always, woefully out of his depth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to like this book. I'm sure many of us have had the "I want to read more" feeling. I've read hundreds of books over the last fifteen years. I am a sucker for a good romance and so the "will they/won't they" thing always intrigues me.   When I started reading this book, I knew I had to put it down.  It was painful to slog through the entire thing.  The main characters are two girls.  One is pretty, and the other is plain.  Both have their good points and bad points.  There were several chapters where I wanted the good girl to win, and her best friend to lose.  I also wanted to know how the other girls' love lives had come about.  In the end, I did have a pretty good time reading it, but I didn't find it a particularly good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading a very good book. The book is "A Brief History of God" and is written by a great theologian, Dr. Peter Kreeft.   It is a good summary of the various ways in which the Bible has been interpreted over time.  I learned that many people still believe that the God described in the Bible is the same God described by Christian mysticism.  And that is simply not the case.  This book also goes into the history of Christianity.  It includes some very interesting historical facts about the origins of Christianity and some of the problems with it today.  There are some people who say Christianity is the most successful religion in the world today. I am not sure they have read the book.  They are mistaken.  Christianity has had more than its fair share of ups and downs over the centuries. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really had high hopes for this book, as I read through the synopsis, reviews, and the blurb. I had been reading many romance novels over the years, mostly historicals with some fantasy thrown in, and I thought, hey, this book has a pretty good chance of being one of the good ones.  After I finished the book and looked over the bluster, I realized it was a total disappointment, and a horrible example of how romance authors write today.  The main character, a married woman named Emily, is a total bimbo who doesn't know what a date is and ends up making fools of herself, then getting blamed for it when it doesn't work out.  And the characters are dull at best, the writing is horrible, and there's a lot of awkwardness throughout the story.  I think this is a perfect example of why romance isn't as popular as it used to be, as it doesnno follow the formula. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disgrace to scholarship on a historical topic. It is filled with factual errors and false assertions that do not square with accepted scholarship. It makes claims about American history and the founding of the country that are completely untrue.  In addition, it omits significant information that should have been included.  It was not until the late 1980s that most Americans really grasped the true significance of the Emancipation Proclamation, and it wasn't until the 1990s that people finally understood that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the beginning of the end of the era of white supremacy in America. It takes an extremely biased and dishonest historian to write about this era without acknowledging these points, and then ignore the evidence that refutes his claims.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was just bad. I had not heard of David Deutsch before reading this book, and while I was not disappointed, I am not very happy about it either. I liked his earlier novels and found his nonfiction writing to be solid. While his work for the American Historical Association was not very good, I found his book about Hitler to be somewhat decent. As a historian, his conclusions were plausible (he even mentions the existence of a Nazi secret police unit, as well as various examples of how German intelligence, military, and law enforcement collaborated in the extermination of the Jews during the war) but the subject of his book (Deutsch's review of The Destruction of the European Jews) was not. Deutsch seems to feel that the extermination was all Hitler's doing, and he provides no evidence for this thesis. He even mentions how the Germans did not execute any Jewish leaders when they had the chance and even claims that the Gestapo was in fact a Jewish organization. His book is simply an attempt to justify the German invasion, in which over one million Jews were killed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on a whim. I've been wanting to read a book on women in history, so it seemed like a great place to start. I got a little bogged down in the subject of women's rights, and the fact that it was written by a woman didn't help my cause much. Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. It wasn't a boring, dry book, but it wasn't particularly interesting either. There are a lot of references and historical facts thrown at us, but there's not much that happens in the end of the book that will move you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for the express purpose of reading it.  In retrospect, I realize I would have bought it anyway.   The writing style seems off-puttingly academic and overly intellectual.  I would not be interested in a book about the social and moral aspects of a fictional television show about a group of New Yorkers.  My interest is in the characters and the relationships 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible.  No author has been so unhelpful to me and other readers as Mr. Bleszinski.  A couple of sentences, a little character description, and the conclusion - "Well, the ending is the point" - was enough for me to toss the book in the trash.   The problem is not that the book is bad, but that the author makes such a bad mistake so often.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was full of errors and factual errors.  First of all, as someone who has been studying a wide variety of historical issues for about 30 years, I was very confused about many of the topics covered in this book, and had difficulty following the analysis.  It's a good book, but I'm still not sure I can take all the errors at face value. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total waste of my time. The author has a problem with her father. Her dad has been very abusive to her since she was a child. He always had a good reason for his actions and she didn't always understand why he did things, but she was always willing to forgive him. But one day, she found a letter from her father, where he said that he regretted what happened to her as much as he did. She was so angry and she refused to talk to him, but finally she found out that he did something bad to another woman's family. She went to her father and begged him to tell her the truth. He refused and she had to leave him. Since then she hasn't seen him or spoken to him for years.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a professional writer, and a lifelong Christian, this is a terrible book.  If you want to read something that makes a few claims that sound plausible while making sure to give the facts that debunk them in a short paragraph or two, then this is for you.  It begins by citing several of the Bible's accounts of miracles, and ends by making the claim that: "miracles are no longer necessary or credible in our era."  But miracles are very real, as demonstrated by numerous instances that the early Church chroniclers and others who lived through the time were quite familiar with (i.e. the healing of a leper, the appearance of the "savior" in Jerusalem, the resurrection of St. Paul).  If there were no miracle stories from the time, then no one would know that a miraculous event had actually occurred.  This book simply recycles the same old claims that can be easily and repeatedly refuted by the facts of the real world (i  "It's not God who has been doing all the work, he just wants us to believe that he did.  That's what happens when you let a man with a beard and long white hair in your living room and act as though he is God."   "It's God who's been doing the work.  He's done it all.  And why should we believe that God's not good enough for us?"  I'm sure you can come up with other examples that are equally ridiculous (i'd be happy to consider them).  But the point remains: the book makes claims that are obviously not true, but it still gets a few good reviews out of Amazon.  There is an article (citation needed) at the Christian Post that calls the book, "a refreshing and humorous look at the miracle of evolution."  And I agree.  The author's goal was to poke fun at the fact that people still believe in miraculous claims about a deity who supposedly created the universe and everything in it.  His method was somewhat similar to making fun of religious fundamentalists by quoting them, but the result was different because he was attacking the claims of the Christian faith.  But because of the author's attempt at humor, the book is a very lighthearted read that is good for an evening on a porch with a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave it a try after having read a few good ones in the past. After reading this book, I found myself wishing that I had the nerve to give it three stars. It is a very good book that teaches basic English, but is written so poorly that I found it difficult to get through it. The grammar mistakes are many, including "p" and "f." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a hard time getting through this book. It is tedious, the narrative is poor and the content is lacking. It reads like someone has been slaving over a typewriter and trying to make it as good as possible without being able to get the words out of their head. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book like this one is so obviously written for an audience of teens and tweens. Not only are the characters so flat and the narrative so flat, the plot so non-existent, the author's attempts to give the book some kind of depth is so obvious as to be insulting:  You know that one friend who's always right about everything? Well, this one friend has the same sense of humor as everyone else in the book.  When he thinks that your girlfriend is being mean to you because you haven't taken her on a date, you'll be laughing until you pass out.  This author is clearly obsessed with teens and has no idea that no one's that silly.  As someone who has written for teenagers, I feel like I have a very specific audience and I can do little more than disappoint them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in a bookstore in the hopes of finding a good book, but I found this to be the worst  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book.  I was looking forward to reading a good work of fiction that was well written.  This book is a collection of short stories with only one being a full length novel.  The stories in the collection are all about one specific character.  His name is John.  John is an alcoholic and is constantly in danger.  He gets into a fight with the local sheriff when he is caught drinking.  When the sheriff tries to arrest him, John manages to escape.  Unfortunately, this leads to another encounter.  That encounter is one that will change John's life forever.  If John hadn't fought that encounter, he might still be an alcoholic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about a year ago, when I was working with a friend who is a pediatrician. The book was very well written and interesting, and I thought it was pretty good. However, after finishing it, I thought to myself, "Why didn't I pay more attention in school about this?" Because I was still taking Spanish and French as a high school junior, and so I had read everything about Spanish/French in my grade school French classes. After reading this book, I decided that I wasn't going to take those classes anymore. I don't need to learn something I know well. I'm going to read it on my own, because it's just too bad that I read it when I did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors. There is no reference to the Greek and Latin translations of the Bible in the footnotes (the ones that were used by some of the editors of this book). There is also no reference or citation to Josephus in the introduction. The only example of reference given is to the book of Jude. I'm not even sure where that one comes from since Josephus never mentions it. Other examples: (a) The chapter on the first Christian martyrs is called "A Brief Account of the First Christian Martyrs." It should be called "An Appreciation of the Early Christian Martyrdom." (b) "There was no New Testament until the year 40 C.E., when the Apostle Paul wrote to the churches in Rome and Athens. This is probably why some people have the impression that the Gospels were written at that time." It was written in the early second century (probably late 40's). It was very late in the century to have a New Testament written. (c) "The gospels are written to be used by the Church as a guide and guidebook. If any of the gospels were taken out of the context of the Gospel of John, the New Testament would be worthless." This is the way Paul wrote in Acts 22:18. He is talking about the Old Testament. He doesn't want the New to be an excuse to throw away the Old. The New Testament is not a collection of useless stories. (d) "Luke 24:15 tells us that the disciples were told that if anyone says that Jesus is the son of God, he is told to go and lie down in the middle of a road and not to move from that place." I'm assuming he means Jesus was actually born in Bethlehem. (e) "Jesus taught his disciples that there is only one way to find God: by praying to him." This was written on a blank page (I'm sure he was very clear about this). It's really a common way of saying "just say the right things" (the right words). I don't recall this being mentioned in any other gospel. (f) "He said, 'I have come here as the messenger of God...I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.'... Jesus' followers were asked, 'What good thing must we do to be saved?' The Lord answered, 'If anyone says to me, "Lord, help me
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing more than a very unprofessional compilation of old and bad stories, many of them very old. I could not stand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked this book, but it fell short of its potential.   From the very beginning I was looking forward to the sequel, but I'm glad that I never got to find out what happened to Willam's family.  Unfortunately, Willam never gets to hear what her children have to say to her about her choices.  It was as if her family had all gone on vacation and then she hadn't been told about it until much later.  This is a great story about two people dealing with their family's separation.  I don't know if it's an accurate representation of the divorce, but at least it didn't come across as a cheap imitation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the most negative thing I've read in a long time.  The whole concept of "the world as it is" is based on the assumption that the world has always been this way.  While this is true for the vast majority of people living in the Western world,  the idea that we live in an "authentic" version of the past has come under increasing fire in recent years,  with evidence mounting that our present culture is actually a by-product of the Western civilization that emerged from the Dark Ages.  If it turns out that the past is different from the present, we can move to a new "authenticity" (which has not been established).  This does not seem to be the case in the book.  At most, there is the assertion that "some people" (usually women) may have been able to adapt to a different way of life in the past.  Given the sheer volume of evidence, this assertion is more a case of confirmation bias than anything else.  I could see a woman living in a hut with the reindeer her husband brought her for Christmas in the 1700s as being able to survive, but what if she was not?  I think we need a "realistic" history to figure that out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, the author argues that Christianity is not really about belief but about being faithful. The central theme is the suffering Jesus endured before rising from the dead to be a living presence in the world. The Bible teaches that God sends people into exile to be tempted and tested, and that when they are tempted, God will send them out with the love of a friend or a family member. These are the "temptations" that the author believes to be Jesus' only real temptation in the Bible. The problem with this book is that Jesus' temptations in the gospels are only three of many that we learn about through the scriptures. While the author says that Jesus was tempted "many times" by evil men, he omits the fact that these temptations are so numerous that they can't possibly have been the only time Jesus was challenged. He also omits many details of Jesus' life which are important to know before he was put on trial. So if we are going to base our faith on the Bible, we need to know the rest. This book doesn't teach us that we are required to believe what the Bible says. Instead, it says that we will be able to believe it by faith without having to believe everything that the Bible claims. I find this to be an unscholarly approach. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in preparation for taking a course in Latin and had the idea of doing a Latin course on YouTube.   The book, which is well-written, is useful for that purpose.  However,  the subject matter is just awful   All the examples are drawn from real Latin texts, but they  are taken out of context.  A good example is the expression "ponderest   (what the doctor told) "  It is used in reference to the fact that a disease is not curable.  The Latin word "ponens "  is sometimes used in the same way, but it is not  considered equivalent to "poner   because it requires the patient to be actively involved in the disease.  When someone is actively involved it means he or she is suffering from the disease  (which is not what the doctor was describing).  Unfortunately, this is the sort of thing that often gets slipped into the book, although it is never the main point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst thing I can say about this book is that it was written by someone with nothing better to do, and so he has no talent for writing.  This book is littered with examples of poor writing. It is also filled with grammatical errors (I have seen more than one sentence that simply says, "I understand now" as though the speaker was reading a dictionary instead of the text).  The last ten pages, in which the author is trying to prove the validity of "the power of a good story," really drive the point home.  It's a very interesting idea and very well-written, but it's not worth the trouble if the story is so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As an atheist, this book was not for me. I found it to be uninteresting, tedious, and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of space.  The story line was interesting, and the idea for a group to play in a fantasy game sounded interesting. However, the actual plot is the exact opposite of that.  When the group finds themselves trapped in a dungeon, they must figure out how to get out by themselves, and then use an item to transport themselves.  However, even after they figure out the puzzle, they still have to do it in order to get to the next room.  At the end of the book, they find out they have been trapped in the dungeon since the day before, and they have no way of getting out of it.  What's more, they spend the entire book making a fool of themselves. I don't know about the rest of the people who have read this book, but I'd avoid it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book. I was impressed at how well she handled the subjects she covers: religion, social class, race, gender, and politics. I can see how a person might use this book as a platform to spread her message, especially if the book is well written. It's not. She doesn't present her ideas well, and sometimes doesn't even talk about the ideas at all, but instead regurgitates the arguments of those who already agreed with her. The book also suffers from a lack of critical thought. I know that there are many people out there who disagree with her, and that's great. But, I found myself constantly questioning the conclusions she reached, and wondering why someone would take someone else's words as fact. Also, she doesn't take into account the effects of political movements on people, or how the individual experiences of race can affect our political outlook. I found this book to be an overpriced and poorly written attempt to sway me in her direction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very bad.   First of all, I have to admit, as a lifelong Christian, I'm not a huge fan of Bible stories.  I found the stories in this book to be boring and contrived.  But more importantly, the author's attempt to connect all these stories in a single, overarching "truth" leaves me with the feeling that the author is looking to gain popularity with the Christian crowd by pushing a particular idea.  While I do believe that all the stories are true, the way he connects them just doesn't make sense to me.  This doesn't stop the book from being entertaining.  Unfortunately, what we end up with is a mishmash of stories that all have to do with Jesus.  What a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book.  First, it is not only badly written but the author himself seems to be unaware of what it is he is saying. He is a writer of popular fiction and he seems to think he is being serious when he writes about this topic, but I can't see what the point is. There is nothing particularly wrong with sex or a desire to have it with someone of the same sex, but in this case it comes off as a bad joke. It is a great joke, but it is written poorly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't get many good books out of the library these days, and I think this one will be a particularly difficult read.  It's a rehash of a lot of popular Christian books in a rather short time frame, and that means it's very likely to get many more hits than many of the other books I've checked out.  But the problem is that those other books are, in my opinion, much better books.  The message is just as important and profound, and the way in which the authors are able to present it is more effective.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Well, I just finished this book (at a time when I'm already too worn out from being overstressed at work), and it was a total disappointment.  I was going to be so happy to finally read a good YA novel, but this one was a disappointment.    The author writes about what it's like to be "a person who lives with Lyme disease."  Not only is the description of Lyme disease utterly misleading, it goes on to describe the symptoms of Lyme Disease like some sort of self-diagnostic test.  It describes Lyme Disease as being "like having a cold but in the morning your throat and tongue feel swollen and itchy."  That's exactly what Lyme Disease is like.  Lyme Disease   reads like a description of a bad day.       The main character (the daughter of a famous actor) is an outcast.  She's a young woman from a wealthy family with a good job, who lives in a nice house with her mother, and has lots of friends.  Her mother, who is a successful actress and designer, thinks the daughter is very pretty, and her father is a well-respected doctor who is considered "handsome and sophisticated."  The daughter hates her father and spends her free time playing video games instead of going out, and she's never been to a party.  Yet she always makes it to one of her mom's parties (one of the few times she's not sick)  and she always ends up in the guest list.  When the daughter asks her mother why she's always there, her mother explains that she's sick but is unable to go out because her "bodily functions aren't functioning properly."   After this explanation, the character never returns to the party, because it's "too expensive."  She never goes to a gay or lesbian party because there aren't any gay or lesbians.  The character goes to the "nerdy" party because, as her mother says, "You're too old to be gay, though."  But she gets sick anyway.  This makes it even worse, because she doesn't understand why her "physical" symptoms of illness don't seem that bad to other people.  So she ends up being hospitalized and having her appendix out in order to treat Lyme Disease.  (I'm sure this is the only time that a book has ever told a medical procedure with such a negative, condesc
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in the public library and I must confess that I was completely disappointed with it.  It contains numerous errors and misleading facts.  Even when I tried to take it all apart and check out its flaws, there were still more, and still worse.  The author, for example, claims that the New Testament has no epistles.  As I looked more closely at the list of authors, I found out that none of the five apostles, and only one of the twelve, had any direct relationship to the New World.  Not one of them could have written the Epistles to the Galatians.  So much for "a free gift from God."  Then she states that Paul had no close relationship with any Jewish person.  I found no evidence of that either.  Furthermore, she claims that Paul was responsible for establishing the doctrine of the Trinity.  Again, there is no evidence.  All she can say is that there is a connection between his conversion to Christianity and the inclusion of the term "one God" in the Nicene Creed.  There is absolutely no evidence that he was involved in any of that.  She also states that he never gave an explicit theological argument for the Trinity, but he did use the image of a "fractal" view of God in his epistles to establish it.   Not only is it false that he used a "fragment" argument, but the fact that he made a more precise statement in his letter to the Romans that God is "all in all" (1:3) indicates that he knew the doctrine well.   I was also disappointed with her assertion that Paul believed in an old Earth.  First of all, the first four chapters of Romans have nothing to do with the topic at hand.  In Chapter 2, Paul tells us that God sent his Son to die for us, and then to take up our punishment.   In Chapter 4, he says that God created us, then took it up (which is why Paul gives us that title).   In chapter 1, he teaches that God does not take it up, but God sends his Son and that he takes it up.   There is no need to repeat these three points because she already has, once again, demonstrated her ignorance.   Now for the rest of the book: she attacks the "prosperity gospel" (a good thing) by showing that Jesus had only a superficial connection with its
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to find a book to help me understand the problem of religion in America.  The title, "The God Delusion," suggested an intelligent, skeptical approach, but in practice, it is just a bunch of clichés.  It is one thing to say that religion is a myth. It is another to claim that a certain person is not God.  I would have been much better off reading the following two books: The Case for the Existence of God by Richard Dawkins and Why I Am Not a Christian by Richard Gale. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to read this book. I have enjoyed books on philosophy and theology that cover topics like free will and evil. These books are easy to read, easy to teach, and very well put together. I loved the theology portion, but this book is about free will? That seems to be a contradiction in terms. This book is a waste of time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read several books about Buddhism. This book is the worst. It's a total waste of time and money and is an absolute bore to read. The writing style is very amateurish and lacks even the slightest of skill.  The main character, Shanti, never really develops beyond being a stereotypical Buddhist monk. Her motivations and even her goals are never clear to me and it's never clear why she bothers to do what she does. She constantly harps on about the bad things that "bad" Buddhists are doing (and what is wrong with "bad Buddhists") but she never offers any examples of such things.  This is especially bizarre given that she claims to have read a lot about Buddhism in order to write this book.  Also, Shanto's motivations for traveling all the way to Sri Lanka are completely made up. She gets "chills" and decides to become a Buddhist, then she decides that she hates Buddhism and wants to leave, but is forced to stay by her parents.  For some reason, her parents are so stubborn about her staying that she never really gives them a chance to tell her how wrong they are.  And then there is the fact that she keeps saying all the bad stuff about Buddhist people, but doesn't say anything good about any of them, which is a little strange considering that many of the examples given in the book are people she claims have made a huge difference in her life (even though none of them are Buddhist herself).  All in all, this book is a complete waste of everyone's time and I really can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book. I couldn't put it down even after finishing. The author has no idea how to write a story with believable characters. She makes the characters act in a completely bizarre manner, and in some cases, she makes it so the characters just don't act at all.  I hate her "The Man With the Iron Fists" story.  It was so bad that it felt like a parody 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did enjoy it, but didn't get all that much out of it.  There are definitely some good parts in it, and I'm curious to see if some of those will stick around for me (as I'm a fan of the genre). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book tedious and a bit boring.  The author claims she came across a quote from one of her professors at Harvard:  'If I were a very bright 15-year-old boy, I would not be able to distinguish between the thoughts of an intelligent man and those of an idiot.'  I don't know if it's so obvious to a 15- or 18-year old but this quote seems so self-evidently true that it seems like a pretty lame, if somewhat amusing, attempt at being sarcastic  I have a hard time reading things I disagree with, especially when the books are so much more than a dry summary 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high expectations for this book, but this just fell short:  The characters are completely uninteresting and uninspiring. They are unsympathetic, and lack any personality. They also don't do much in the way of plot development, and the narrative is very rushed throughout.  The plot is incredibly cliche, and is the sole reason that I gave the book 3 stars.   The novel is an example of the common problem of writing in a high school setting.  It attempts to be funny, but it fails spectacularly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to read The Devil is a Liar by Jonathan Jones. It was so bad I gave up.  He has a habit of writing with the sort of style you'd expect from a first-grade teacher who had been caught cheating on her students.  The sentences begin, "I did not have sex with your mother," and I thought to myself, "This is the book I have been waiting for."  This is the one, I suppose, where Jones actually gives some credit to the people he describes, instead of using them as a way to make his case.  One woman, for example, says she was "horrified" when Jones described how her husband used to tell his girlfriend that she "had no self-control."  The woman's response? "Well, he must have had a pretty good one!"  Another time, Jones talks about a boy who had "been sent to a reform school" because of his "sexual predilections."  "We know from a lot of experience," Jones said, "that most sexual predators are not pedophiles, but are driven by a desire to have sex just once and then go to bed."  There you have it: Jones sees "sexual abuse" as nothing more than "one time sex."  And the next thing he's going to write is that some rapists have "the desire to rape repeatedly, and are unable to control themselves."  Jones' book has everything to do with proving his point. It has absolutely nothing to do at all with truth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only book I had to do research on for the final draft of my dissertation was this one.   This book is not a good read    While the subject matter is intriguing, the research methods used to support the conclusions are very poor.  Unfortunately, the conclusions that have been drawn from the work are either erroneous or based on shaky research methods.  The main conclusion that a number of the authors draw  is that women who engage in aggressive dating behaviors are more likely to engage in physical and emotional violence toward their romantic partners than are women who are passive.  I can understand that women may choose aggressive dating behavior as a way to make up for past abusive behavior.  However, it appears that the authors have used flawed research methods to draw their conclusions.  In order to draw a conclusion that women are more violent than men, they have to rely on their conclusion that "aggressive women tend to have a much higher incidence of sexual assault, while passive women have less."  If that were the case, then I would expect men to be more violent towards women than women towards men   But that is not the case.  A review of the research shows that women and men are equally violent in their relationships.  It appears that women tend towards passive aggression in their relationship with men, whereas men tend towards aggressive aggression in relationship with women   It does not appear that women initiate the violent behavior, but the research demonstrates that men are not very likely to initiate violence either.  Although there are a few examples of women who choose passive behavior to compensate for their past abusive behaviors, the data do not support the conclusion that they are more prone to this behavior than men are.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book.   My initial thought:  "This is just another self-help book by a popular author.  If it's any good, the subject matter is so trivial and it's so written in a shallow and superficial way, it doesn't get much deeper than this."   But the book became a lot more than that.  It helped me understand my own thinking and helped me develop the same self-awareness that was the point of the book. I'm glad I read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that there is more to this book than meets the eye. The writing style is interesting and I am sure that it will prove itself interesting and useful over time. The author does not use the "bad" part of literature (i.e. excessive descriptions, gratuitous use of slang and cliches, and so on). His interest is in exploring the meaning of language and the meaning that a particular expression, such as "good boy" or "sweetheart", has in our culture. He explores the meaning in his own way. Although the author is aware that he is writing about the language of an adolescent boy, he is also very clear about what he is NOT writing about. He does not talk about the meaning behind what teenagers say, or what they may have meant by saying something. He discusses the "why" behind those words. He has done this before, in his book What's So Bad About the Music? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason I am giving this book a low rating is because I did not enjoy it as much as I wanted to.  It had a good premise:  A group of students from a Jewish boarding school in Canada go to Israel for a short break.  I liked this premise because I do believe that people who are raised in the Jewish faith are more sensitive to others' feelings and generally are more empathetic.  Unfortunately, the book did not develop this premise well.  The characters were so similar in personality and mannerisms that it was difficult to distinguish between them.  One character, in particular, felt like she was going to explode at the mention of the other characters' names.  Although some characters were interesting, other characters were not.  Overall, it was hard for me to enjoy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know that I had any real connection to the plot as it was written.  I just read it for the writing and enjoyed the descriptions.   But I felt as if I knew the characters more from the back cover of the book than I did during the actual reading of it.  The character who did not appear in the story seemed to be a bit of a waste of space (one I was not very fond of).  I feel the author needed to change a few things about the characters so they would make more sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of the worst I have ever read. It has absolutely no merit as an academic work. It is nothing but recycled bad advice, and it has been so for many years. If anyone has used the advice of Dr. John Money or Dr. Michael Farzan, I apologize. It seems that each of these authors, for whatever reason, has found a way to justify this useless information. Dr. Money was a good doctor for many people but is no longer considered an authority on mental health. Dr Farzan is a physician and the man who coined the term "mood disorder". Both are considered quacks, and the information they provide is nothing more than a series of catchy aphorisms that can be memorized. I know this information will not help me but I am a patient. The book is so bad that it is hard to be interested in anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read all of the Harry Potter series, but I've always hated the character of Draco Malfoy. He is so unlikeable that I can't imagine reading any of his books anymore. And yet, here comes this book with all those nasty qualities. The plot is a mess, the characters are dull, and the world-building is lame. I was so sad when it ended that I put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book.  First off, it takes a lot of effort to even be able to understand what the author is talking about; and even then, it's not easy to follow.  What she has to say doesn't make any sense; I keep having to go back and reread certain sentences in order to understand them.  She also writes very much like a child, making mistakes, making up things, etc., not just stating facts that are not necessarily true.  And then there are the little lies she tells.  "He didn't like to drink." "He was very religious." "She kept him awake."  Even though he did like to play in the basement, he had trouble going back to sleep in the middle of the night, and had to be put to bed by himself."  What the heck is going on here?  As I read on, it became less and less believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. I found it interesting as many people have written about the Vietnam War and how it affected their lives. I find it a little less interesting when the author's own experience isn't referenced or emphasized as a positive point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am absolutely disgusted with this book. I've read books by various authors who have been accused of being bad writers, but none of those claims have come true. This one has, as the author admits himself. In addition, this book's authors admit that they were influenced by books by other authors.   It's not that they don't try their best to write original stuff, it's that they just can't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all.  A great deal of time is spent reading from an academic perspective that may not apply to everyday life in a large part of the U.S. The book is also a bit too academic to be useful in daily life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry to say that the book is a big disappointment in the genre of sci-fi literature.  As I've said before, I've enjoyed science fiction since I first read it in elementary school, so I have high hopes for this book.  It is supposed to be "science fiction for people who think of themselves as 'normal,' 'rational,' and 'civilized.'"  The book is set in a future where technology has greatly improved human life.  These improvements have made the people (humans, not robots or other intelligent beings) more powerful and able to take more responsibility in their lives.  In their new world, a new breed of people is introduced to the world and given a new form of government.  There are those who disagree with these changes, but they are ignored because they don't fit in with society's "progress."  The first person narrator, a young girl, is very interested in this new form and tries to figure out how it works.  Unfortunately, she soon learns that the new form is a lot less enlightened than the people who were given it.  I found that the introduction to the story seemed rushed and somewhat misleading.  For example, the book says that the young woman is "the first human being who has ever lived who has a direct line to the God of the universe."  I didn't realize that she was from the future!  Also, the first chapter tells us that the main character's parents died in a fire, and we are told, later in the book, that they had been reincarnated as human beings.  This makes me wonder if the author is trying to tell us something about reincarnation, but he can't remember.  The main character, in the first few chapters, gets a lot of material from a religious group which says that "humans should be treated as gods."  (The author later says that these people don't belong in the "modern" society but he doesn't tell us how they got there.)  As the book progresses, the religious people become more and more irrational, and one of them even becomes a dangerous killer.  Fortunately, the main protagonist discovers that she is immortal and can kill these people without ever having to die herself.  However, she is never fully convinced that this is true, so she keeps on trying to figure it out and learn more about this form of "perfect" human life which she doesn't understand.  If this book had ended at the
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been a fan of Dr. David D. Burns's work for many years. I've read his books on the history of medicine, the history and development of medicine in the United States, and his treatment of cancer, all of which are very thought provoking. Burns' work on the rise and fall of ancient societies is especially insightful and interesting. I had heard good things about this book, but I have to say I found it to be very disappointing. Burns takes many of the same concepts that he has been teaching for many decades in other books and applies them here. However, the conclusions are not supported by the evidence presented, and instead boil down to one statement:  "It is possible for a society to survive and flourish if it follows a set of principles and if it is willing to change those principles at will." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character is incredibly one-dimensional, especially considering that he's written as being gay. I'm an adult woman, with the intelligence of a saint. I can think for myself without relying on someone else to tell me what to think. I've been through this a few times before. But this time it really did sting. I am not in a position to just go out and buy the latest gay-themed book in the area or something. I have a few good books that I can borrow for a day or two from friends and then return to read on my own time. But after this, I'm just not sure what to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did NOT like this book. I had no idea there was so much wrong with it.  First, it's not really a history of religion.  Second, the historical accuracy of it (which I assumed was there anyway) is not there.  There are several stories about people who converted to Islam who did NOT turn out to be true Muslims (for example, it tells about a woman named Ismaila who is not really Ismail).  It tells of a guy named Abdullah (who wasn't even really Abdullah) who is NOT Abdullah.  It makes many ridiculous claims, like that all the Muslims who followed Muhammad were peaceful and it is "unlikely" that people like Muhammad would do evil things.  And, it uses many quotes from the Quran, such as that Muhammad was a prophet who was a human being like you or me, and there are many people who are closer to Allah than we are.  The quotes in it aren't just "I said so", but there is an "it is so" kind of quality that I just don't like.  I don't even think the Quran is all that holy because, even though it is the "holy book," many of the things that Muhammad did (such as beheading people and burning people alive) aren't really that great.  In addition, Muhammad had many women (whom I don' think were truly his wives) that he slept with (or at least had sex with).  And finally, he didn't really have a "true" religion (I am pretty sure the Jews and Christians did too).  Instead, I think he just pretended that his religion was real, because he was worried about being thrown in Hell.  If Muhammad were just a really bad person, this book could be OK.  But it's a big fat lie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, but had trouble putting it down. It was very interesting but too repetitive.  I guess I was expecting some real thought provoking insights or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was an attempt to explain how modern American society, as well as the world in general, is a "post-Christian" one.  While I am not a Christian, and while I am glad that more Christians are waking up to the fact that their religion is nonsense, I am just as unhappy with the attempt to claim the Christian view of reality as being just as valid as any other. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried reading this book after many, many failed attempts to finish it.  It was always something that I found myself not wanting to read anymore, due to the same things that kept me from finishing it in the first place.   The ending was especially frustrating, as I feel it wasn't as "out there" as I'd hoped.  But I'm glad I finally gave it another try. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, after listening to the author's previous book, but this one turned out to be more of a disappointment than a success.  The book is about the early history of the world's first true civilization, a very complex society which emerged in a fertile region of southern China in the 4th century BC.  After two hundred years, the Chinese culture of the region had been ruined, and the Chinese began to migrate west.  But the book describes how this movement was, for the most part, a disaster.  This civilization was based on a combination of Confucian ethics and local superstitions that are still very much alive in Chinese culture today.  In particular, the book recounts the attempts by China's rulers to get rid of the bad spirits that were apparently causing the people to go crazy.  As I read through the book, I could not help but wonder if these attempts were in vain: if the Chinese leaders really were successful in getting rid of evil spirits, would that really have been the end of the matter?  This is an interesting book, but I had to come to the conclusion that it has much more in common with the work of a 19th century English philosopher (who, by the way, was also from China) than with actual historical research.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was very poorly written and it never took me to another world that I would not visit again.   I don't need a good book to be an interesting read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a review and had to throw it away. I've had bad reviews of this kind before. In one case I thought the author was a cranky old man who kept on using "facts" that didn't make any sense. In this case, however, I got the impression that the author got his information from a book about a particular sect. He kept mentioning the name "Mormon" and "Reorganized Church" several times in order to support his point. It was obvious that he'd done that because his book didn't mention them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read.  It starts off by describing how much of an idiot I was before my wife and I decided to get married, so I can't relate to what the characters are going through.  I can only think of one time in my life when I made an idiot of myself, and that was while reading an overly long chapter of the Bible, at the age of 14.  When you write a book that is as pretentious and self-important as this one is, I am sure you had a reason for writing it.  Maybe you had some inspiration to do it, but you don't seem to care that the book is just plain dumb.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book with great anticipation, hoping for a more literary book with some "wow" moments.  I was not disappointed.  While I appreciate the author's ability to create characters I can relate to, I feel she uses that ability to the detriment of her plot.  The first three characters are the only ones I'm really interested in reading about, and as the book progresses I have my own problems with the ones she has created, like the character who is obsessed with getting her hair done.  Even in that case I could see the flaws, but her obsession with it is just annoying and unnecessary.  Overall, this book reads better when it's just a reading experience, and when there is no plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to this book, because I'm a huge fan of John Fowles, so it was great to see him writing a John F. Fowly novel. It's an interesting concept to say the least: a world where humans are no longer the dominant species. While the concept might be interesting on a technical level, the execution is a bit too obvious for my taste. It reads like a bunch of disparate scenes in Fowley's other novels (like "The Night of the Hunter") were merged into one story and told as an action thriller. The ending is a complete surprise and not in a good way, and the characters are unsympathetic and unappealing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A terrible book about what a terrible person this book is about and why it is so.  It's an attempt to write about the "dark side" of Christianity while ignoring everything else.  No matter how many times the author makes "an appearance" in the book, she is not there to "help" people learn the good things in their religion.  She wants them to see how bad Christianity is, and how awful Christianity is because of that.  The author doesn't want to help her readers to see the good side of Christianity, she just wants to make them hate it.  I really did not enjoy reading this book at all, and I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book mainly because I am in the process of writing a paper on the book.  I am surprised that the author's views on women are so much closer to mine than to others, and to be more specific, that the book's authorship is so clearly hers.  Unfortunately, I found that much of the book had absolutely nothing to do with writing, but everything to do not with writing at all.  It's clear that the authorship was her idea, but she fails to make it clear that she didn't just copy from other authors, but that she thought the content of the books she read was great.  She's obviously very confident about her own work, but what about other books? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be absolutely useless for me.  I went into the book expecting to learn how to draw more characters and how to do so better.  Instead, it left me with absolutely no ideas for my next project.  This book is just about explaining how to make a profit as a cartoonist.  It doesn't have much to say about the subject.  No lessons were taught about how to take better pictures.  The cartoonists are all self-published and don't appear to be making much money.  They are probably all trying to cash in on the craze for 'comic books.'  No tips about how you can be more successful.   As I walked away from the book, I couldn't believe that the authors thought this book was a good idea for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like the way she uses religion to support her feminist theories, and so the book doesn't work for me. But I found the ideas fascinating, and I found them intriguing enough to buy the paperback and look up the book in a library, which I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book.  I know it's been out for over a year now, but it's finally on my shelf.  The first thing that caught my eye was the title.  It seemed so out of place for a YA book. Then I noticed that it was titled "Toys, Lace, and Murder"  The chapter on the dolls was especially interesting.  He discusses the differences between toys like the Pongo and the Barbie, and the differences in the way that girls like to play with dolls.  Of course, he makes it sound like Barbie is a doll, while the Pongos are doll-like.  For a kid who likes to watch television, the author uses this very well.  But I still think that he made a big mistake in writing the chapter about dolls as toys.  What about all those girls who play with Barbies as though they were dolls, but want a doll when they grow up?  There are plenty of dolls that aren't just dolls-they are actually cute, or are just as much fun to play around with.  This is especially true if you look at what other children play with.   The chapter ended with the chapter on clothes and how the Pongs dress in them.  There was something so wrong about this, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  Maybe it's the way the author wrote about the PONGs in the past.  In one of the chapters, he describes how his friend's PONG was once "so small, they were hard to see."  I guess that's the exact type of thing I've been saying lately about Barbie dolls.   It's so hard to decide which one I like better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read a few of the self-help books that are included with each paperback of this book. While they usually make good points, there are some things in them that just annoy me.  For one thing, there is absolutely no discussion of how to deal with problems that arise during pregnancy or after childbirth.  There are, however, plenty of tips for dealing with pregnancy anxiety.  Instead, the focus is on what to do once pregnancy is over.  I do not think that this is the best approach, but it is certainly better than what you get in the book: "Pregnancy is a wonderful time to be a person. It's a time of great change and growth and new possibilities. But it can be challenging, sometimes very frustrating, and you will have times of depression, frustration and loss. What's important is that you learn how to handle those challenges so you can enjoy the wonderful moments that are ahead of you."  That is certainly true, but the advice about "how to deal" is too vague and non-specific to be helpful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has many good points, such as its argument that "there are many ways to believe that some beliefs are true."  However, the book itself is very tedious.  It begins by talking about the various ways in which we can be wrong and the mistakes we often make.  Next, the author makes a lengthy case against "the god hypothesis," and then tries to defend it from these objections.  This is a little silly, because "thegodhypothesis" has been the focus of many intelligent people's lives for generations now,  and the arguments against it have been very strong, especially when the evidence for the god hypothesis is discussed.  One might think that a book which begins with a discussion of all the ways in wher a belief might be false is likely to conclude, if anything, that belief in the god hypotheses is very common.   For example, one might think of the arguments offered by many agnostics to the effect that "God does not exist."  (Indeed, if one subscribes to the agnostic position, "God doesn't exist" is a reasonable position to take.)  Yet if there is a common way to be wrong, then this common way must be the most common way, and the agnosticism/atheism debate is not much of a debate at all.  The author's book is the opposite of a "good argument" in the usual sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't tell you how many times I've come to this book looking for something to do in between writing my own stuff and getting it published. I'm so glad I finally read it because I never found anything that could keep my attention for that long.  I'm not a good reader.  But I'm certainly a lot smarter than the average person, so my brain never fails me.   And while I have read a bunch of books on women in history, I've never come across anything that was as interesting or as well written as this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book!   It's all about being nice to yourself.  I think the book could have been a lot more effective if it focused more on the process of overcoming obstacles and not the outcome.  For instance, it mentions how some people have learned to take "bothersome" feelings like anxiety or fear, and become "softer."  This sounds great, but that doesn't mean we're never ever going to be afraid again.  And some people can become so sensitive to their own feelings that they get so wound up when others are happy that they just can't do anything to make people feel good.  The solution to all of that is to realize you're only human and that you're going to have bad days.  That's what self-care is: not making everyone's problems go away.  If you're feeling like a horrible person for not making people feel better, try being nice instead of thinking of ways to help people feel happy or relaxed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this book.  From the cover, I was sold.  The prose is so clear, it's hard to understand how the author was able to make it all sound so well written.  As for the book itself, it is very poorly written.   The main character's plot is so convoluted, it doesn't make any sense and is difficult to follow.  In the middle of her tale, the author mentions, "For all the problems and issues I have with this book, it does get its point across, even if some of its points are a little shaky."  This is true.   However, this is what I have come to expect from a poorly written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a pretty bad book. It made the poor characters all the worse. We were supposed to be seeing their side of the story, not their pathetic attempts to escape their fates, and we get some pretty good one-liners about what a terrible person they were. And we were also supposed to see the happy family of the two main characters. They seemed so happy that I didn't know if I was supposed to like them. But the writing didn't help. It was so terrible, and it didn't seem to even be trying to try. I really wanted to feel sorry for these characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.  There is no discussion of the ethics of torture and its application.  The author does mention the ethical problems of the use of torture by the US but does not explore those issues.  She never discusses the ethical issues of medical research  It is difficult to tell from the book whether she really believes that it is wrong to use torture to obtain information that will lead to better medical care for victims of cancer.  Or whether she simply does not know about them.  Either way it is a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A complete and utter disappointment. I read this book because I was considering reading it. The only reason I've actually finished it is because I read it on a Kindle in order to write reviews. The author doesn't do much to convince me that she is competent as a writer, nor does she seem particularly interested in writing a quality work of non-fiction. Instead, the book is so full of spelling and grammatical errors that I could only take the first 30 pages or so as the story. The second half of the book consists of a litany of complaints about people who were offended by a minor incident, such as the use of the word "lame". The author has also been known to use terms like "trashy", "clueless", "stupid", and "bimbo" without providing any kind of rationale or real argument behind those statements. In addition, the author has not even attempted to engage the reader in an actual discussion about why her points are important. As such, this book has been a total waste of my time. It's a sad and depressing waste, especially since I was going to read it for the fun of the reading it provided.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, we get to see the life of two women: a lawyer (who we know to be the most intelligent of all characters) and a woman of the law (who, it seems, has a rather unhealthy obsession with the law).  These characters are rather different, and it would be very hard to imagine both of them as a romantic partner.  Unfortunately, they also have a problem: they both have issues with their bodies.   I would like to say that this is a good book about women, but it isn't.  It is a bad, terrible book about men.  The authors say that it is a work of fiction, but I believe that there was a serious attempt to write something worthwhile, and to do so in a very different style.  They also seem to be saying that the female characters would make great husbands.  I have to agree that the two women in this book aren't worth the time spent reading about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book about an awful idea.  It is a combination of bad writing, bad psychology, bad logic, bad history, bad sociology, bad social engineering, and the worst kind of self-serving self-aggrandizement.  And it is all done in an attempt to present a self-justifying, narcissistic, and elitist worldview.  There are many other books out there that discuss a different view of the world, but I would never call this one good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book.  I enjoyed the last book a lot and was really looking forward to this one, but I found myself getting tired after a few chapters.  The book is about a young woman who is trying to be a nun and becomes involved with some men at a monastery.  She is basically given to these men without her consent and eventually ends up being raped by them.  It was an interesting story that was told in a realistic and emotional manner, but it just wasn't interesting for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is misleading.   It's about a couple who is married and living in an apartment in a nice part of town.  They have two kids, who aren't in the picture at all.  The kids are more or less ignored.  But that doesn't seem to matter much when the wife is having a breakdown and threatens to divorce.  It seems to me that this book is an excuse for the author to have fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, we learn that when you live in a big city, you do not know what the outside is like, because no one has ever gone out in the middle of the night to do a bad thing. The only way they have ever gone outside is to do bad things in the street, or run through the garbage. I think this is a common theme in the novels of James Tiptree Jr. It seems like he wants to make you feel as if you are living inside a video game. The book's main conceit is that if a man is not in his own skin, he will do anything to stay in it. The author takes the metaphor a step further in explaining that a man can only be happy if he feels like he is always running around in some kind of virtual reality, which is why he keeps his money in a safe rather than in his wallet. I've tried reading other Tiptrees novels, but they never really hit the mark for me. I feel like he was on to something with this one, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to read The Power of Habit and had high hopes for its success. I was totally let down.   This book is full of half-baked techniques that don't really work to help people develop habits, and which can actually hinder them.  I learned nothing new about my own habits, since most of what he describes is things I've been doing for years. The only thing that worked for me is to write in my journal at the end of the day.  Overall, this book is a waste of time, and a waste my money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a very unpleasant read. The author was obviously trying to sell us something but failed miserably, and I'm not a connoisseur of the genre and can't vouch for her writing skills. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high expectations for this book. This book is a disaster, it fails to impress with a poor writing style, poor historical knowledge, and an overwhelming amount of assumptions, all while attempting to present an argument that is not supported by the primary sources.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read in my life is The Devil's Dictionary ( The Devil, the Devil, and the Master Key.  I'm still trying to get over how much I hated that one ).  This book is even worse.  It doesn't even have the excuse of being the Devil's own dictionary.  The book is filled with a million errors (and they are all spelling errors) and the author has a terrible knowledge of the subject.  If you really want to know something, read the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to learn about the most bizarre, inexplicable, and inexplicable of the paranormal or paranormal studies, you can do a lot worse than this book. It's written by an obviously intelligent, upstanding, intelligent person. I would suggest that she take a look at her childhood and how that impacted her as she grew up. I've had my fair share of mental illnesses, but I've been fairly stable for the last decade or so. While I don't think that there are any magic, paranormal or otherwise, phenomena in my life, I think that most of my childhood problems were caused by stress, lack of sleep, and other bad things in my childhood, which I think this book could help her avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed the book as much as the first time I read it, but then this book was just a bit more repetitive and dull than the previous.  I'm just glad I didn't buy this for a Christmas gift.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got excited when the cover first came out because it looked so much like a book I read about twenty years ago on an airplane:  The Last Testament by Richard Rohr. That book was filled with great observations about the human condition, but this book is the opposite.  The main character is a poor man from Brooklyn who gets arrested and spends months in prison.  He's not just poor, he's a poor sinner, and he's really in need of the grace of God.  It was easy to get the author's point of view, but I couldn't get behind his theology.  His theology is one of guilt and salvation and he spends a lot of time arguing about those two things.   His arguments don't hold up very well to scrutiny, but he has a point:  Our life is a living, active ministry.  If we spend a lot time thinking about our guilt, then our faith will suffer.  So, if you think guilt is bad, then this book will seem like good news.  But if you believe in the atonement, then you will likely disagree.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a joke.  It tries to be interesting, but fails completely at its mission.  For the first fifty pages, the author claims that she is a "science writer and editor at a scientific journal."  The real life scientific journal, Science magazine, never published anything by her.  As for the fact that she tried to get her published at one of the science magazines, I had to look it up.  She was not published at any of them.   No science article, journal, or book is worth the paper it is written on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is crap.  The story line and characters, while fun, have nothing to do with the plot, which, to be fair, is pretty weak.  But, I liked the characters so much I bought the sequel anyway, which was fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A typical book by someone who has a lot of expertise in a field he isn't very good at. He uses his knowledge in a simplistic manner that makes him seem knowledgeable but doesn't really explain anything in depth. It's just a lot to sift through for little benefit and more to confuse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favorite character was the hero. The villain?    The entire book is about how he made himself the scapegoat for his own evil.  He goes around with a bullhorn screaming at other men to stop raping women and killing innocent children.   He doesn't even realize he's the one doing the raping.  But then he's still a bad guy, right?  He just can't help himself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very excited to get this book. I'm a huge fantasy reader, but as a big nerd I can't stand books that are strictly plot driven. The story is great, but the characters are flat.  In a good fantasy, the characters live in a world full of mystery, danger and magic. In this book, there's nothing but action, a huge cast of characters, and a villain who is a walking stereotype. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book   to be completely unhelpful to me and to most of my fellow readers. The book was written by an English professor, but not a real English professor. He tries to tell us the grammar rules and the vocabulary of American English, but then the next sentence says, "I use this, this, and this to refer to    things in a   language I am   using, but it is not my   native   use."   It's as if he is trying to convince us that his native language is   a  language of perfect and simple rules.   This is absurd and his inability to recognize that is a big part of   his self-contradicting attempt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many books about writing, but none as poorly written as this one. The writing style is tedious and repetitive, the ideas are uninteresting and the ideas themselves seem like something that the author would have read from a journal or a good book at some point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the main idea in this book was good, that it would teach young people that it is important to understand that no matter how bad things are, sometimes, in the end, good things happen. I'm glad to have learned that, but, unfortunately, that doesn't mean that I learned how to enjoy a good book as much as I did. The characters are all just so annoying, with their self-centeredness, lack of concern for others, and inability to understand how important it is to do the right thing. The book spends most of its time describing the problems with one of the main characters, and it's pretty obvious by the end that there's something seriously wrong with her. I was hoping that the book would at least explore the issues raised, but it spends so much time on them that I found myself skipping pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's all been said many times, but this is such an unnecessary, boring, over-hyped, overrated, overstuffed, poorly-written, poorly translated, poorly edited book that I will say this for the first time.  It should be a trilogy, but I've already heard the third book, "Trial by Fire", is better and a lot more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have just finished this book. I know it is based on a true story and I have heard it so often that I don't believe it was just made up. But I can't resist.   It is not only boring but also insulting to the American people.  The book starts by describing how the United States is going to become the number one oil exporter by 2035. This is just one of the many things they say is going on and this is just going to happen, or this is only going to occur in the US. There is just so much nonsense.  One part of the book described the United Nations as being a "total scam" because they have been so successful in taking over countries and taking their oil.  Another book they have is called The Book of Common Sense. It is the same basic thing and it is the one book I read a few years ago that has helped me to learn more about this country.  They both describe how stupid the world is and how there is nothing anybody can do to stop it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second in a series that has always been disappointing.  The first book did not live up to its promise.  It's a waste of time reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many bad books in the last decade. This one is the worst. It is so unbelievably bad, it is hard to believe anyone would ever want to buy it. The characters are so badly drawn, the plots so poorly developed, the writing so atrocious, the dialogue so hammy, that it is impossible to read it. It reads like a poorly-researched attempt at a Hollywood action movie, with poor acting and bad dialogue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated it! It was horrible and pointless, a boring story about a boring person, who couldn't write well because he is too smart for that. I really wish I'd never paid any attention to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not very big on YA fiction but I bought this book because it had the tagline "A teenager's tale of growing up."   The book is full of clichés and clichés are not my cup of tea.  When I was a kid, I read a book called The House of Jealous Lovers about a girl who loses her virginity to her neighbor.  There are several instances in this book where a character is describing how she fantasizes about her neighbor, but the story doesn't get anywhere and the characters never act on it.  The premise of a teenage girl's story of growing ups and "getting in" is something I could get behind.  I liked the book enough to finish it, but I'm still pretty disappointed in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I were going to read one book, this was it. I'm a professor in a college library, and this is the only book that I have ever had to give the dreaded "bad recommendation" (which has happened twice in the last few years), or worse, to put it in its own box. This book is very long, not because it's so hard to read, but because it takes a lot of effort to keep reading.  The first thing that struck me about it, is that it does not tell the whole truth.  Many of the "contradictions" that I had expected to see (such as the assertion that "it was never the Soviets who defeated the Nazis") simply are not there.  And it is a long book, at least 700 pages, so it can take a long time to digest.  This is the worst I've encountered on the subject of the Cold War, as well as on history in general.  I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially for a history book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I am very glad that I bought this book for a good price, I found that, as is often the case with these sort of books, it is an extremely thin, one-dimensional, and unconvincing argument.  The main case for believing in God, for example, is that God has created the universe, and that the world is the way it is because of the existence of a good and powerful creator.  This argument is extremely weak, because the universe does not have to be the way we believe it is   As well, as some theologians have noted, the argument from evil fails because if there is a good being who is good and also capable of being evil, then the argument against evil is no longer valid.  As another theologian points out, one of the reasons God is not perfect is that he made a mistake when creating man in the first place.  It is the error of thinking that God will not be offended by a sinful being who will do evil if it is in the best interests of him.  I could go on and on with these and similar points, but I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who has not yet read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is about how a few guys get together for a day of drinking and a couple of hours of casual sex.  I really enjoyed the idea, but I found the execution to be very lacking.  For one thing, the narrator seemed so desperate for his friends' approval that he kept getting all histrionic when his friends kept turning him down.  It was like he needed to prove he's not like those other guys.  If only that part about him didn't keep happening.  In addition, the characters were not interesting at all.  Not only were the guys not really believable, but they weren't very interesting themselves.  The one who was the least interesting (and the most boring) was the one who ended up getting the action.  Also, the way they ended up hooking up seemed like it was written to be just a hook-up.  I'm not sure why they needed to make them so desperate to get laid that they ended having a fling, but it worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written.  The entire book takes place in a hotel room.  While the author is using the hotel room as a metaphor for his life, it is in fact used in the book to explain what is really wrong with his life.  Although the hotel scene is entertaining, it fails to convey any real meaning.  I did not like the characters in the movie very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. I read it twice and thought it was an amazing read. But as I was going back to it, I kept finding new things that didn't quite fit. It was as if the author didn't want to spoil the surprise of the first few pages, so she left the details hanging in the air.   The main character is just...well...a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this as an introduction to the series and found it lacking.  It's not bad enough to make me abandon reading this series entirely, but it's not great either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book a lot, although I never really liked the book. It's very boring and pretentious in its treatment of the Bible. I read many other Bible study books and enjoyed them even more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not in the habit of buying books on this subject, but this one caught my interest.  The subject of the book is a topic I have studied extensively.  And it is one I have been curious about for quite some time.  This book discusses the role of religion in human society.  In the chapters that follow, the author discusses: the importance of religion to human civilization, the role religion has played in the history of different cultures, the roles religion plays in various countries, and the relationship between religion and economic systems.  These topics are not the kind that are usually covered in introductory texts on the subject.  However, in a field that is as full of contradictions as the human race is, it is important to study these aspects.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed by this book. I found it to be an attempt to make sense of a very strange phenomenon--the existence of extraterrestrial life.    Unfortunately, as many previous books and studies have shown, the evidence is very weak.  The only thing that seems to support the theory is the fact that there are no other life forms that would have the necessary attributes (complexity, intelligent design, etc.) to be extraterrestrials.  So if there are extraterrestrial beings, why aren't there other life-forms that possess these characteristics?   It's quite clear that there is no extraterrestrial intelligence at all.  In fact, there is every indication that the probability of the existence of intelligent life in the universe is extremely low. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, I felt like my reading was stifled by the author's style.  The style doesn't lend itself well to a descriptive narrative.  And it's also extremely difficult to tell how a character's feelings change over the course of a book.  My favorite characters are usually the most realistic: the woman who's been raped, the man who's become a heroin addict, and the woman whose father abandoned her as a child.  These three women are very real in my life.  But the author doesn't seem to be trying to portray them with any real humanity.  I liked the author for her humor but I didn't enjoy the way her style stifled my reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading this book and just wanted to cry.   For me, it is the same problem I have with the popular book, The Magician's Nephew:  What I didn't like about that book was that the author used the phrase "the child born of two wolves" and I'm pretty sure I saw a wolf in the title.  There's just so much violence in this book that I just couldn't keep my eyes open while reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as an undergraduate in an English course. It was a disappointing read.  I wanted to like it, but there is something about the style and the overuse of certain expressions that seemed to be a cheap gimmick for the sake of a good story.  In addition, many of the characters (particularly the characters named "Sophie" and "Tom") are just annoying stereotypes and are not developed at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you enjoy reading about interesting people, this book is an excellent example of how to do so.  But if you hate people, you will hate it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm trying to read this book as I have heard about it many times and have never read it. I am so tired of the same old cliches in so many book after book.  It's like they are all being written by the same author who didn't understand the original work or wanted to rewrite it.  He's trying to create a new genre.   If the characters in the original stories are interesting enough, he tries to add too many plot elements to make it more "realistic."   It's really not that realistic at all.  I found a lot of the events of the story just ridiculous.  If a person has no idea of what is really going on or is trying to hide his/her feelings, I can't imagine anyone acting that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is that most people's expectations about what the author might write are based on other authors they have read. While they can be good, they usually aren't. This was no exception.   I enjoyed the book quite a bit, even if I wasn't quite as engaged as I would have liked.  I'm not sure I'll ever want to read a work by this author again, although she has also done the same for others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm having an interesting time with this book. I liked the book when I first got it (it's my favourite on my bookshelf), and I've read through it several times, with varying results. The first two times, I had to stop and reread the text several times just to make sure I had understood everything correctly. This time, I finished the book in one day, because I got lost at the end. For the first part, I was totally in it with the idea of a young couple who are friends and have been for many years. The second part was really disappointing, though, because the authors made it sound as if they were trying to teach me some "mythology." To my surprise, I didn't really have a clear idea of what these "myths" were about. The "mysterious powers" and "magic spells" and such were all pretty thin and unconvincing. And the real reason why I don't like them? Because I've learned about those things long before I was "willing to admit it," and there's nothing mysterious or magical about them. This was all just a bunch of mumbo jumbo in search of an excuse for not being "real." It seemed to me that they'd rather try to shove in a bunch a "mystical" mumbo-jumbo, rather than just come up with something new, original, and interesting to make the book entertaining. Maybe I'm just being a stickler, but if you want to write a book that you can read and enjoy multiple times, you don't need to come up w/ some sort of "mystery." It's a mystery if you don"t believe it, not if you believe it. And it"s hard for me to believe that the authors, despite having been readers for so long, still can't figure that out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved reading this book but felt that the ending was not well-done. I really enjoyed reading the story about the boy who was abandoned by his parents but is taken in by a woman named Dottie and goes to live with her. She is a woman who is very concerned about her son's behavior. It was a joy to read. But she never really comes to terms with what happened to her son. She spends a lot of time trying to figure out who he might be and why he was taken away from her. But the end of the book ends with her not really having any idea what to do next. She goes back to living in the house with her mother and there is nothing else to do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is one of those books that I read hoping that I would come away from it with my mind clear. I do not.  As a former academic, I felt that it was an attempt by a former professor to re-interpret his earlier work as the new paradigm. This was certainly the case with the chapters on consciousness and spirituality. It was certainly not the case in his work as a cognitive psychologist.  He claimed to have learned how to think in a certain way, and now was trying to interpret it in terms of the new insights that he had learned in a new field of psychology.  It did not work.  The chapters on spirituality seemed mostly to be an attempt to get his former colleagues in the cognitive psychology department to read the books.  At one point he claims to have "sucked the wind out of" the old generation of researchers with his discoveries in the 1990's.  A few paragraphs later, he describes himself as having "the wind sucked out of me by a generation of psychologists who were too intellectually lazy to understand why I had the wind sucked from me," and goes on to explain that he has no interest in being part of any of the intellectual organizations that want to be the intellectual leadership of the world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book thinking it was going to be a funny, good story with lots of good lines, but it turns out to be much worse. The most egregious error in this book occurs when D.B. Jackson, as the only character we ever see, mentions that he has a family of dogs. The family that he mentions is of dogs; D. B. Jackson is a dog person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a couple of recommendations for you to think about: 1. The first time I read this, I found it a bit repetitive. I also found the characters a bit wooden, but they're a good pair of characters in a good book. 2. The second time I had this book, I wanted it to go on forever. The author keeps introducing characters and they get so very repetitive. Finally, I just couldn't put this book down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed it enough to recommend it. However, after a couple of weeks, it became just a chore to keep rereading it. I was so excited to begin reading the book, but instead I read an old copy of The Stranger by Robert Bloch (the same author), and I didn't enjoy that either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the writing of the author to be lazy and repetitive, especially in regards to the subject matter of the book, which is one of the more interesting and important areas of research to take into consideration (not that I was a huge fan of it anyway), but then again, the main character is one who has spent a large amount of time on the internet, so maybe that's just me and I don't think I'm the only one that feels that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst novel I've ever read. It is filled with tedious, hackneyed, dull characters, who in any conceivable situation, would have to come up with the most outlandish explanation to save themselves. I'm actually sad this is the one I'm reading now, because it has so much potential. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time and money. It is so bad I can't understand how anyone could take it seriously. It was the first book I have ever purchased that was written by a woman. I had always assumed that only men could write books, and now I find out they can write bad books too!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing I like about this book is that it was written for a non-fiction series of the same name, although, I could not remember the names of the authors and the books themselves were rather hard to find. However, even without this knowledge, I can't put down this book and had to take another look at it several times.   As I said before, the authors do not really do a good job at giving a history of the Second World War, the reasons for the end of the war or the events that were crucial. The only reason I kept reading was that there was something I found fascinating about the Nazis:  While the rest of the Germans were very poor, the Nazis were very rich. It was also believed by many Germans that the Jews controlled the economy and controlled the news. The Nazis were a big deal in Germany. They were a symbol of strength, pride and success. This book has some good information about how the Nazis came into power and some good history on how the First World War came to an end, but it was difficult to follow the authors' explanations when it came to the Nazi's plans for the Second.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that I dislike about this book is the fact that it was a collection of articles written on an Internet forum (a very bad idea for a book). They all have a bad name because of the bad writing style, the biased opinion, and the fact they are just recycled information.  I also dislike the fact the author (a woman) claims to have been "taken over" by a spirit after she went to visit her father's grave, which doesn't actually make much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For the past two years, I have spent countless hours trying to get a grip on this novel.  I have written my own book reviews and thought I would just keep a list of the most common issues that I encountered:  1.  In the preface, it is stated that a third-person narrative is an important aspect of this novel, but there is no indication that there is any real narrative at all.  This is an issue that is repeated throughout the novel:  I didn't see a reason to read it.     It is repetitive and poorly written.   2.  The worldbuilding is quite poor.  It sounds as if the author is using a lot of different names for the same region, but doesn't seem to have a solid idea of what the region is called.  Even a simple look at the map would have shown what the author was trying to do.     3.  At one point in the novel, the character is referred to as a "wizard."    This term is used often, and is an interesting choice.   However, it does not have the same connotation as a wizard does in the Harry Potter series.   4.  When the character talks about the "magical power" of the characters, he uses this phrase without the intention of defining what it is.  However, the use of "magik" is still used throughout the book, which is a more common way to refer to magic.   5.  There is a lot in this book about the politics of the country.   The author does a good job of explaining the details, but at one point I was confused by it.   6.  Overall, this book doesn't work as a plot.  Some of the things that happen are interesting, but it isn't a compelling story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was going to rate this book as one of the worst things I've ever read.  But I really didn't enjoy it.  The main problem I had was with the characters, particularly in regards to the main character's development.  He had some great moments, but the problem was that he kept getting better, but his development always fell short of his previous peak.  I think that he was already a great character, but when he reached the peak of his development, he stopped progressing.  It's hard to follow a story in which a character reaches a peak that he shouldn't have, especially if he's just an ordinary guy with no superpowers or abilities.  When he was in middle school, he was almost a perfect student.  Now that he's in high school, I feel like he really has a lot of potential.  However, in this story, the story focuses on the first three or four books.  This was a good thing.  If the story focused on the other two books, it would have been a little more enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't say I found this book very interesting. The "narrative" presented in the book was a little confusing, and the conclusions were mostly not supported. It felt a little repetitive. This may have been an attempt to "balance" the books available for teaching, but it just wasn't very interesting in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book is bad.  I was excited about it, but found that the writing was pretty bad. Some parts are boring and pointless, and some parts were so clunky that they just weren't worth the trouble to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book in hope of finding out what it would sound like if you took all the parts from different authors and put them together.  Unfortunately, I was hoping for more than the book actually delivered.  I thought the book would be interesting and have the same tone that John Grisham uses in The Firm  (Grisham's new novel is out in paperback as I write this).  However, the book is just so incoherent and unfocused that it leaves a bad aftertaste.  The characters are all completely in the wrong place.  A guy is trying to explain to his wife why she has to keep paying his rent.  There is a line where he writes, "If he has no desire to get out, he'll keep living like a slob until he dies."  Another character is talking about his "dream job" and says, "I can't believe it's finally here."  Why is a woman talking about a "dream" job?  Why are her dreams "a bit different than the dream of all the other women?"  Is the dream that he is going to work for a wealthy man as a secretary so that he can have a real job? Is this dream the reason for his divorce?  Or is it because she has no other dream?  It's hard to tell.  Why does the man keep trying to make a "big" plan to get her to leave him?  I guess he thinks he can make a successful plan for the future, but then he gets upset when it doesn't work.  And why did he ever think it would work in the first place?  He doesn't believe in himself.  That doesn't seem very believable.  He can't make plans. He can never, ever see past his own failures.  It sounds like he's just hoping it will eventually work out.  What's more, he doesn't even believe he needs a "good job" to pay his rent, so it seems a little strange he is giving up everything to try to find one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book after being recommended it by another friend.   It sounds too much like a "typical" high school book, with all the same plot devices as a lot of them.  The characters are all so one-dimensional and boring, I can't stand them. The book is also pretty long, which is a downside, but I was hoping for something better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should not have been published.  I understand that the author does not believe in evolution or that humans have evolved from other animals, but he still managed to write this book.  The title "How Animals Grieve" seems to suggest that grief is a human emotion; however, as a psychologist I know that humans don't just grieve over the loss of a loved one - grief is the biological response to the death of a close friend or a close relative.  There are numerous cases of mammals grieving for the death or disappearance of close family members, and even animals that are considered to be completely unrelated to one another.  Even if the author wanted to imply that humans are grief-stricken creatures, I think that is an incorrect premise.  Animals experience grief in a variety of ways, but there is a significant difference between humans and other animals in that humans do not typically feel the need to mourn the loss or death of other animals. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a world full of good books,  I just cannot find  anything worthy  of recommending  This  was a  terrible    The story is  unbelievable   This is  a  perfect   bad  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a total waste of time and space.  I have a lot of respect for Hesse, but  this book is just an exercise in  pointless drivel...
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good thing about this book is its title. It would have been better if she had titled it "The True Story of a Falsely Accused," "The Great American Scam," "How a Big Banks Attempt to Bribe a Reporter for Information About a Scandal," or something similar. It sounds like a good scam book but it is really a bad one, full of bad information and poor research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book when I first started. It starts well, but by the end, it's not the book I wanted. There were too many chapters that were just repetitive; too many things that are "the same" at various points. Even the title, "The Unbeliever's Guide to a Happy Life", is misleading. Why not write a book called, "A Happy and Meaningful Life"? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and felt utterly disheartened by it.  The main character is a woman who, in the course of the book, undergoes a near fatal series of maladies including: severe depression, loss of memory, extreme weight gain, and inability to conceive, and her only recourse is to undergo a series of risky but highly experimental procedures to try to reverse the damage.  Even more disheartening is the fact that the doctors involved are generally incompetent, incompetent, and incompetent, despite the desperate efforts of their patients.  I found it difficult to identify with anyone in this book other than the woman.  If she did manage to overcome her ailments, the book would have lost its appeal.  It's hard to take seriously anything that involves doctors who are incompetent and incompetent. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is boring and very repetitive. The characters, especially the protagonists, have an unoriginal, stereotyped look.  I also found that the book is filled with redundant, boring jargon and puns that do nothing but waste the reader's time.  In spite of that, the characters in this book are interesting enough to read about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and found it to be a failure. I am a fan of the works of Tolkien and so, I was intrigued by this idea that there was a "second" world connected with the first. I was very disappointed. Tolkien made much of this in his writings: the two worlds, which are almost identical, were created as a way to hide from each other the fact that they are two separate, but very much related, worlds. This was a great idea and I was interested in learning more about it. However, this "world" in the story is so little different than Tolkien's own world that I find it very difficult to believe. What little similarity there is is only in the fact (or belief) that the two planets "share" the same name and that they both use a similar alphabet. This is far from the most interesting and novel thing about this world. I would have preferred that this story be more about the interesting and unique characters and less about the world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you haven't read this book and the two earlier volumes of hers, I don't want to give you the wrong impression: this was a fantastic series, and it was one of the best fantasy series I've read in quite some time.   The characters were so well-developed and developed characters they had depth, and they were all fascinating.  I was particularly fond of Istari, the daughter of a disgraced noble and one of many children who suffered the tragedy that is life: her parents were killed by assassins, she was kidnapped and brainwashed, and her fate is to live her life in service of the royal family of her ancestors.  It's an interesting idea, and one that I'm going to have to reread when it comes out in paperback. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading this book since I was about 12. It was recommended to me by my uncle when I was living in New York, which I think is one of the reasons it's so bad, because I was so taken by it. My uncle had given me the paperback, and I have always been unable to put it down.    It was very enjoyable, though. I'm now in my 30s and a mother of two, so it's a great excuse to read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not thrilled with this book. I found the writing style very pretentious and un-informative. The language was very high-falutin and was used to try to make the story sound more interesting than it was. The writing style did not lend itself well to easy comprehension. I was also annoyed by the amount of times a character was named only by his first name. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not present a convincing case for its own existence. The argument that it was written by a prophet of God is very weak. It is a collection of quotes from various writers of the past. Most of them are from the 20th century. There are several quotations that are not in the Bible but are quotes from Christian writers. They sound like quotes from a Christian writer, but not the Bible. There is no attempt to link these quotations to the Bible, though they appear in the context of the Bible and were probably intended to be quoted from the Bible as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not really a fan of the series, but I found this a really bad retelling. I'm sure it's a great story and I think that's what really sold the books to me. However, since this book is such a clear attempt at a "clean version," it fails miserably.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been looking for a good work on economics that was free from the distortions of ideology and economics taught at business school, and found none. This book is different in that it doesn't try to present a "deeper" or "greater" view of economic problems, but instead, it makes some broad points on the economic problems we face today. That said, I found a few of his statements to be highly questionable, especially his assertion that the government can provide a level playing field for everyone, even though it provides no such thing. In other cases, I thought his reasoning was either fallacious or misleading, although he does provide some evidence for these claims. It will be interesting to see if anyone else finds fault with the book's points, as it does make some interesting points that I didn't necessarily agree with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have given this book a four star review, but I can't do that.  The book is based on a non-fiction book written by Robert Bork, a prominent judge and conservative jurist who was one of the most right-wing jurists in the country until he decided not to vote to uphold Roe v Wade in 1992.  Bork writes the book as an attempt to defend that decision, but fails miserably.   Bunkum.  He tries to find justification for the ruling by saying that abortion laws were different in previous years, but that does not excuse the ruling.  At the very least, Bork should have pointed out the obvious fact that the ruling had an ideological motive and that, contrary to Bork's claim, it was based on ideology not science.  Despite this, the book is very hard to put down, even when you realize that it was written for a right- wing audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book, but I can't say why. I've read many bad books in my life but never any bad ones by women writers. The characters are shallow, the plot is nonsensical and illogical, and the writing is cringe-worthy. There are a few parts of the book that are very well done, like the ending of the first chapter and the book's conclusion. But I can tell you from personal experience that this book just isn't for me. The only redeeming thing I can say is that it contains many good, original quotes from famous people (you know, that is supposed to happen in books about women writers).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed the book and loved that it was written by someone who had a PhD in genetics and who knew exactly what he was talking about. He was very good in explaining the technical aspects of his findings but he didn't explain why he felt certain things were true or how he knew those things. He said the reason he had so much data was because he took the time to go around to different labs and ask them what was going on. I thought this was a good thing to do since it gave him credibility as a researcher. Unfortunately, he said a lot of things that were not supported by his research. For example, he says he has found that "the majority of children are chromosomally identical in all but one cell" (p. 144). But he gives no details on how he got the data that he gave in this quote. How can a researcher, who has gone to such lengths to collect the DNA samples, say that it is the cells that matter, not the individuals? And why would he say he has tested "every single child born in the US since 1978," (p, 145), when we know that this is an impossible statistic to know with any certainty? Another example is the "dental crown-nose" association. He says that "this association was so strong that I concluded that it must be genetic" (i.e., "the genes for this trait exist and must be passed on from one generation to the next"): "I concluded that these [crown-nosed] twins must have inherited their crowns from a common ancestor, which could mean they had an identical crown-to-noses ratio or that they had inherited crown-like traits from both of their fathers." (p., 151). However, this is a huge leap from the simple fact that if you have a single gene for a trait and you can pass it to one child, you have an increased likelihood of having the same trait in your children. It would be as if the odds of winning the lottery were increased by getting the same ticket every time you buy a ticket. I do not think that geneticists would accept this idea, even if it is true. It is easy for me to see how anyone could be fooled by this story. (And I am sure that at least some other geneticists did not believe this.) It is true that in the United States it is easier to get the DNA and a dentist to tell you the tooth is different if
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In all honesty, this was the worst book I've ever read. It's just so poorly written, so patently incorrect in its assumptions, so poorly presented, so hopelessly out of date.  I have read hundreds of books on all aspects of psychology, but I've never read a book like this.   It's so bad that it's hard to believe I even spent time on it.  Even worse, it just gets worse and worse as you get further into it, not only in its basic premises and content, but in its inability to explain or justify any of its conclusions.  It just seems like a horrible waste of time.  If you need a good way to waste time, read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has no plot.  It is a series of short, unrelated stories.  The author is simply telling the story of an author's experience with writing, and each story follows the same story format, but with different characters.  There are no real characters to keep the book interesting, and they have no depth to their character at all.  I enjoyed them, but they are not as interesting as the first few stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The fact that the book claims to have taken the 'best' bits of each book makes me wonder if it really has.  The book starts off with an example of an English school boy's ability to memorize words and then spends much of the first half of the book describing his success in memorizing the Bible.  After that he's in the Bible class all day and, much to his surprise, manages to make a great Bible study group out of it.  (For some reason this book has a lot of kids in it and has very little historical content.)  I was interested in this book because it sounds so familiar.  Unfortunately, this book is full of errors.  It makes many claims about the development of the English language and grammar.  However, when it comes to the development in the spelling of words, it's just a bad story.  In fact, there is no such thing as a good or bad speller.  Most of the words that make it into the Bible are pretty common and are easily remembered.  Then, when you get to the harder words that have to do with grammar or meaning, this is when it really starts to fall apart.  I think the authors have a tendency to use the same words over and over and then use them in several different ways.  They also have a habit of having several different dictionaries which is interesting.  But, ultimately the books just don't add up.  A quick google search shows that the first part is still in print and that the second part was written in 1939, more than 75 years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had an unpleasant experience with this book, which I found hard to finish because I found it very difficult to follow. I found myself having to reread portions of the book multiple times just to keep up with the main points. For example, the section dealing with the difference between a liberal and conservative in philosophy was a total waste of time. There were a few good insights that I think were important to consider, but that kind of thing can be found in the works of many other thinkers (including the great Bertrand Russell) and not so often in books written by philosophers who should know better. On the other hand, I'm not a great fan of the whole "liberal is a person who believes that the best interests of everyone can be achieved through collective action" thing, as it seems to me to be a case of people thinking that they have the "correct" moral code (whatever that is) and using that code to justify oppression (just as some people do). It might be better to say that a liberal believes that collective action will lead to the best outcome.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It reads as though the authors are in need of some serious professional help.  It's been three years since I first read it.  The plot is haphazard, confusing, and completely lacks suspense.  When things do happen, they're so random, you don't even have to think about what's going on.  A character goes on an adventure only to return home, no longer having seen anything.  If you're not interested in exploring a historical fantasy setting, this may not be for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, the author goes around trying to find people who have a high intelligence to share their experiences with, and then he ends up having them read his book.  It's terrible because there are things he gets wrong and things he over exaggerates.  He does his best to explain things in a way that they make sense.  But the whole thing is kind of a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about ten years ago. It was so horribly written that I skipped it. I couldn't put it down, but it made me sick. I still can't put the book down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a book that made me want to never read another book by the same author.  It was so poorly written, I couldn't stop laughing at all of the ridiculous plot points.  The main character is a guy named James who has a problem with his penis.  He is so depressed, he takes solace in his online game.  His problem gets worse when his penis gets caught in a trap, but he's saved by his female avatar, who immediately falls in love with him and is willing to risk her own life to keep him in her life.  Then one day, James is so angry at his girlfriend that he decides to commit suicide.  But before he dies, James finds out he is actually a vampire who can change his penis into any human body he wants.  If James is a good person, he'd use this opportunity to change his life. But instead, he goes on to become a bad person and kill another person's girlfriend.  How could that possibly happen?  I just couldn't buy it.  A book about a character like James?  Not so much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're going to review a book written by someone who has never written one, or is otherwise unqualified for the job, this is a very poor book: it was a slog to read and not at all worth it. The author never explains why she believes in an afterlife, or even what the afterlife might be like. She spends a good deal of time talking about what an  is and how it relates to humans, but doesn't bother to explain how or why  sounds any better than it does. She is also dismissive of skeptics  and describes the skeptic/atheist movement as "viciously opposed to," without providing an example or supporting evidence. She even goes so far as to criticize the Bible and the Koran for their lack of scientific accuracy. As if that is something a person can "fix." She is quick to describe   as "bad science," but fails to explain or justify the  belief that says something. Finally, the book fails to take into account the various ways  might work and be compatible with our current scientific knowledge, and instead focuses on's incompatibility with. I would not give a one star rating to a book if it was just this one issue.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The "gospel" that is presented in this book is a complete fabrication, the basis for which is a work entitled " The Christian Faith," by James White. The author, in his desire to convince the reader that the Gospel was the primary and most important doctrine of the first century, uses James White's work as the basis of his own. This is one of the most dishonest books I have ever read. It attempts to sell Christianity as it was taught and lived by the early Christians, while in reality, its teachings are contrary to Christian truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book, but the plot was so slow and boring that it was like watching a movie in slow motion. The characters were so one dimensional, I could not care about any one of them. Even the two girls who were in love with one another, were so stupid and self-centered that I could care less about them, if I didn't know them well enough to dislike them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be really tedious and poorly written. I found many of the characters to be incredibly dull and unlikable. I really hope I never have to use the internet ever again. I'll try and use the library, but I can't find any of these books on the internet.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part of this book is the way it pretends to be serious about its "theory." It's all about how to use metaphors to explain things and why we use metaphors in the first place. It is a wonderful theory, and it does get a lot right, but it is so full of fluff that it becomes tiresome. Also, it goes off into all kinds of silly tangents without showing a clear understanding of what the metaphor is supposed to be saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't feel at all emotionally involved with the characters; I found them more annoying than funny.   This is the kind of book that's so tedious and dull I just can't wait to put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was totally disappointed with this book.  It's a very poor representation of American history.  Unfortunately, the author doesn't just skim over the negative aspects, he completely ignores the positive ones.  The historical record is a complete fabrication.   The American Revolution wasn't a civil war but a revolution.  We didn't lose because of bad generals and bad leaders.  John Adams did a great job leading the war.  When he was killed in the battle of Yorktown, Adams' widow Mary and the children were able to flee to Canada.  All the other generals and leaders, including George Washington, resigned.  They didn't resign because they had bad generals.  Washington had a long history of good leadership, and the British military was more than willing to do their dirty work for him, but the war was about freedom, not slavery.  There were plenty of Americans in the Revolutionary War that were actually happy to fight for liberty, and they were willing to die for it.  This book tries to paint a picture of the conflict that doesn't exist.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of factual errors. I found many, but the worst was in the chapter on the Holocaust.   The author claims that Auschwitz was a "ghetto" rather than a "death camp" which is ridiculous, because the Nazis used the term "ghettos" to describe "cleansings."  For example, during the Polish ghetto in Warsaw, a young Jewish boy was caught stealing a loaf of bread, and after a short scolding from his father, was sent to work on a kibbutz, but never came back.  Even more absurd, the author states that a Polish child starved to death in an Auschwitz camp.  Not only is the Auschwitz "gassing" center the worst place in the entire Holocaust to be, but there is no credible evidence that children as young as 3 died there.  It is also an insult to the memory of the 1.5 million Polish victims, who were murdered in Auschwitz, to claim that they starved in an underground concentration camp and that it was only the Jews who died in "gassings."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm reading The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson and I'm being a little harsh.   It's a fascinating look at the creation and the rise of the modern police state, and it's a fun read.  The protagonist, Henry Hinckley, is the son of a famous American politician, and his life is the story of what happens when he falls for his mother's mistress.  But there are also some real  plot holes and plot contrivances in the book that detract from its value.  For example, Hinckly's relationship with the mistress is never really explored. She's there for the scene, and doesn't really have much of a storyline.  She doesn't seem that complicated, either, but I don't want to have a guy that I can just switch into when I need someone to do something.  It also seems like Hincklie is just so much a product of his own life circumstances that he's really hard to relate to, and I'd really like to see more from him.  There are also a couple of really awful character moments, one involving Hinckleigh's father, who seems like he's trying way too hard to seem like a hero.  He seems to come off as just another overgrown pederast.  I was glad to have someone like Hinselke as an antagonist to my heroine, but there were just a lot of problems with the character and the book.  Overall, it's still a fun and interesting read, but it's just hard to get into because of all the plot holes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want a good book on the Vietnam War, pick it up, but do not expect an enlightening read.  There is little that is new to this book but the author is not concerned to present a balanced view.  She only provides the book's author's opinions, which are based on her own personal experience with the war.  As such, the author fails to present the true nature of the war or the human costs involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you've read and enjoyed the novels by Ian Fleming, then you'll enjoy this novel. While the plot is interesting, it's not the main attraction. It's the characters and their interactions that leave me wanting to read more. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Fleming or anyone who wants to be entertained by a good spy story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried this book so that I could better understand how my religion came to be. It was a disappointment. It's a very religious book, with very Christian overtones. It is a very good book, however. It only serves to reinforce my Christian values.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is written for laypeople who want to get their bearings and then will feel a bit smug to learn what an expert says is obvious.   The information given is generally correct, but the writing style is too long and wordy.  The author mentions in passing that she will not give her name.  This is fine, but some of her advice and conclusions are so outlandish that it is clear she does not wish to be recognized. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so full of holes that it takes up almost the entire first half of the book.  The first three chapters are the "Introduction" to the book; these chapters are filled with irrelevant material about how good the book is, and how it will help my child grow into a great man, and so on.  I finished the book, but after that I had a hard time even attempting to use the material as examples, because most of it was just flat out wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved   The War of Art   by Steven Pressfield.  It's a memoir of a very successful man, a failure at something, and a lot of regret.   It took me by surprise, but I was intrigued.  I'm looking forward to   the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book because I've been wanting to read something by Richard Baxter for a while.  I'm glad I waited.  This book is a piece of drivel, a cheap, shoddy, unreadable mess that was poorly edited and poorly written.    It is a collection of anecdotes, quotes, and stories from the life of Richard Baxter.  In the "preface" to the book, Baxter says he wrote it "to give you a flavor of the man, to put in your mind the sort of things he liked and enjoyed."  I had the impression that this was going to be a fascinating look at a fascinating man.  It has more in common with a blog post about how much fun you had on vacation than it does with a book about a great man. The material is repetitive.  Baxter's "revelations" are often simply statements about what he "obviously knows" or "obvious facts."  Most of what he tells you seems to be "common sense."  He will say things like:  "The man's a great speaker because he speaks with a tone and style so simple that he has mastered the art of the sound." "The most important thing in a person is a good memory, no question." "When people look at him, his eyes sparkle, even when they don't."  His opinions are so simplistic that he seems to think that his opinions should be taken at face value.  At other times he's vague, like the time he says he doesn't need to be lectured about the importance of education:  "[W]e know why he isn't lecturing: he isn of sound mind and has no need to."  You can read about a variety of topics in the book.  You'll read about the work he did for the CIA, his work for the government on the B-2 Stealth bomber, and the government contracts he worked for.  Then you'll read his advice on how to become successful as a writer:  I want you to consider that one of the most important skills in any creative occupation is the ability to write a good review.  To be honest with myself, I write only when I feel like it, so I don't ever write well for other people. But I feel I can write a better review for you than I ever could if I were to do it for myself.  That's my confession of guilt.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A terrible book that never should have been published.  There are no facts, no evidence, nothing.  The idea is so ludicrous that even the most absurd of "experts" wouldn't come up with it.  We are so busy "protecting the children" that we have to keep them in line and punish them if they disobey, especially for being too stupid to be allowed to play or get a good night's sleep.  A poor mother and her six children must live in a filthy hovel, eat whatever is available to them, and have to endure other poor, disgusting, disgusting conditions.  You would think that if anyone had a sense of humor or sense of justice, this book would never have been printed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave up on reading this book after about 200 pages. The author seems to take the story she wants to write and runs with it, throwing in bits of it at random as the plot requires. It becomes very apparent that the author was not a fan of a certain type of heroine and is forced to write a character like that in a way she finds amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book and everything it stands for.  It is nothing but an extended rant from a spoiled and self-centered brat who will not listen to anybody but himself.    It goes on and on about how wonderful this book is and how it is the perfect Christmas present for every young person in America.  The author even claims he reads the book as a Christmas present every year.  How nice.  However, the rest of the book is just so lame that it's just a waste of money.  I was so eager to recommend it to all my friends that I gave it to my boyfriend and his friends.  They laughed at it so hard that the author was ashamed to tell them.  Then the book was pulled from the library.  Why?  It's so bad that it is a disaster.  As a child, I read every book my mother bought.  When my mom bought this book, I just shrugged it off.  But this year I just couldn't bring myself to recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this to be a rather poor and poorly written book.  For one thing, the book begins with a series of anecdotes about the author's early experience as a poor young student.  There is a lot of repetition, especially in the first chapter, which is filled with self-indulgent stories about the writer's experiences in high school.  It's clear that the author was more interested in writing about herself than in writing a good book.   There is also a certain sense of entitlement and arrogance to the book, as if the author knows more about life than the reader.  Even worse, the author is apparently obsessed with the idea that young people today are more likely to go to college than they used to be.  In particular, she is obsessed with whether students today are being too quick to sign up for the "academy" of college:  The answer to that question is not at all clear, but there is certainly evidence that, since the 1960s, college enrolment has skyrocketed.  And while the number of American high school graduates has increased, the number in some states has actually decreased.  (The answer to the problem, of course, is not to "raise expectations" -- it's to get the students to go out and get a real education.)  While there is a sense of superiority to be had from writing about her own experiences in such detail, the fact that the book is less about education and more about self-promotion is very disappointing.  I have to admit that it took me a long time to finish the book because I found it so repetitive.  If you're thinking about writing a book about high school, I suggest you get a different perspective on what it really means to get that education.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of various interviews conducted over several years with various authors, and the answers are interesting, but I couldn't find any common themes or points that were repeated. They are all interesting enough, but not nearly as "essentially" as I would have liked. I guess I'll give it a chance, but will not be recommending it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back in 2012 and it was a decent read. It was a good way to put my experience of "dealing with" a religious extremist (in this case a fundamentalist Christian) into the context of my own life. However,  this book is nothing but a cheap and shallow attempt to make money with poor writing. It lacks a true intellectual integrity. It reads as if the author read  a lot of cheap biographies, but none that I've read that were actually written by a real religious extremist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just a big pile of nonsense. It's so bad that it's not even funny; it's just bad. No, I'm sorry, but I can't bear to read it anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a disappointment. I tried reading it because I was looking for a good book about the Holocaust. It's a good one, and the research is well done. I also found a reference to an actual book that was written by a Jewish American who was involved in the Holocaust: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a woman who has no interest in or understanding of history. The entire premise was to prove that women are the cause of all bad things in the world (i.e., wars, plagues, famines, etc.).  I don't know if I can call it a book in the traditional sense, because that doesn't really apply to it.  But the idea that all women are good and all men are bad was not well thought out and could not be proved.  It was all too easy to draw connections to current events.  In this regard, I was particularly disappointed that the author was unaware of the Women's Suffrage movement in the United States.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has some great ideas, but does not quite follow through on them. The author talks about the benefits of not taking prescription drugs, but then tells us that we should "totally go ahead and take one now and see if it helps."  I agree with the fact that we can't be perfect (even if we want to be), but I think it would be better to take a pill before having a heart attack, so that we have a better chance of success. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of historical wrong and lies that it's hard to know where to start. The author tries to justify slavery as a matter of religious liberty in the Old Testament and in some instances defends it, but his arguments are so weak that he could not defend the practice at all. In other cases, he simply ignores the evidence. He argues that slaves are better off in the New Testament than in the old, but then never seems to consider that many of the New Testaments are the product of slaves. He also argues that the Old and New Testments agree about slavery, but there is no mention of that in the Bible. He tries to argue that Paul was right in his statement that "He who receives you receives me" (1 Cor. 10:21), but there isn't a shred of evidence for that. He talks about Paul's letter to the Galatians, but again he ignores what Paul says there. The book is filled with historical errors that would make a historian cringe. His treatment of the Old Testaments is even worse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a waste of my time, and I have wasted more of it reading the internet.  The author, a high school history teacher, is an expert on World War II but has no knowledge of any of the people or events she describes.  She often gets things wrong. For example, she claims that American bombers dropped napalm on Japanese cities, which was the truth, but only because of the intense fire that followed the bombs. The US also dropped a ton of bombs on the city of Tokyo, killing or wounding many more people than Japanese planes did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My most recent attempt at reading this book was a complete failure. The book was full of mistakes from the beginning to the end, and each of these errors led to the conclusion that the author's research was lacking. I was particularly appalled at the book's claim that the Native Americans of America practiced polygamy, when the opposite is known to have been the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't want to say that I was bored with this book, but I was pretty unimpressed. I found the story to be very predictable, and the characters to be uninteresting. There are some amusing characters, like "Bert," who is a bad ass but not very interesting or likable, or "Moe" who is basically a sarcastic idiot. It's hard to find an actual "hero" who has more interesting traits than any of the main characters, but, of course, the main character is the best of them all. The villain, on the other hand, is a stereotypical bumbling psychopath and "villainous" character who was so obviously written as a parody that I don.t even bother to comment on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for more from a book about the rise of American Protestantism in the 17th century, and this one seems to fall flat.   The historical details are fascinating, but there's not enough of them. The characters, from the founding fathers to the first settlers in the colonies, are mostly dull and one-dimensional.  At least some of the stories of religious conversions and persecution, including the Puritans and Quakers, are compelling.  This is mainly because they involve men and women who were strong-willed, principled, courageous and well-read.  I would have liked to have seen more of those characters as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book.  It has everything I would want from a good YA book: cute characters, an excellent story line, intriguing twists, a good plot, and a good ending.  Unfortunately, the story had so many flaws that I just didn't feel like I was learning much.  For example, in the end of the book, my main character decides to have sex with the guy she is dating.  After the two-hour sex session, she decides that he is not worth sleeping with any longer and drops him.  That's it.  I know some YA authors have sex in their books to teach lessons about consent, or because they feel the relationship is not going anywhere, but I felt that this was not the case here.  Why did this guy have to be so passive?  Also, at the beginning of the sex scene, my character is in bed with a guy who is about to give her oral sex.  This doesn't seem like much of a reason to have such an intense sex scene.  But then, my boyfriend is also about to be given oral sex, so we're pretty much at the same point.  Finally, my guy starts moaning and begging, so I know she wants to continue, but she is being very passive about it.    Then, my story picks up in the middle of the action, where my main guy is still having sex with this other guy, but now he is getting blowjobs and his partner is going along with it. I'm not a big fan of sexual encounters like this.  They usually don't feel that satisfying, because the girl usually has to do most of the work, but also, it usually involves other sex acts between the two people, and I don't like that.  My main character has a pretty good reason for taking this route, so it doesn't bother me.  Other than that, I felt like my characters were being presented in a really poor light.  If I were reading a sex-positive YA novel, I would be very interested in seeing the characters change their sexual preferences.  And that's how it should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published in 2007.  It is written from the viewpoint of a single young woman.  Her husband is an alcoholic and a bad father.  She has a daughter who is sexually abused.  This abuse continues when the daughter becomes pregnant.  The mother's attitude toward her daughter's condition and her lack of care for her daughter is very disturbing.  I'm surprised this book received so much acclaim at the time because it lacks credibility. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is full of grammatical errors and poor writing.   It is not even close to the quality of my "Bible" series - even the paperback editions are better.  There are many grammatical mistakes in this book, as well as a failure to understand the meaning of many sentences in the New Testament.  I could not agree more with the book reviewer who called this book a "bunch of trash" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The fact that these characters are so unlikable is not an accident. I don't particularly care for them, but I'm not willing to accept a book that treats them like complete and utter failures. For the love of God, if you can't even treat your protagonists like they're worth a damn, then you might want to consider changing the name of your series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been looking forward to reading this book for a long time. It had such great promise.  It starts off promising, but in a matter of chapters the tone changes to something more serious.  The writing is good, but it doesn't stick around long enough to really stick. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book on a plane from London to New York (I was a bit worried by the title). However, as soon as I opened the book I was appalled, and I must say that this is not the first time I've been disappointed by a book about British history. I'm not particularly fond of history, but I think I've learned to recognize its value in this book. If I have been a bit critical of this book so far, I think it's because I'm reading it for the first-time. I've always been somewhat skeptical about British historiography, but it seems to me that this book does a good job of putting the historical record in its proper context (that is, in the context of the 19th-century, when England was emerging from a long period of economic, political, and social decline). It doesn't shy away from mentioning many of the flaws of British histor- ics, but also makes a strong case for how the historical facts are important in making judgments about the present and future of the country. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was one of the worst books I've ever read. It's full of clichés, bad writing and repetitive themes.   I just didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed in this book. I was looking forward to reading this as part of my graduate course, and I was also looking forward on reading the two other books that came with it, which both did not make it through the first page.  These books were good, but I am disappointed in  This is a good book about why I dislike The God Delusion.  I wish that I could be more objective about it, but it is the story of a man who is not quite right in his worldview.  This is not the point of the book, so it is hard to give this negative review a fair analysis. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters, especially the main protagonist, were a drag from the start to the end.  His attitude towards everyone and everything was obnoxious and obnoxious. He kept saying things like "What the heck were you thinking when you put that thing in my eye?" and "I know I didn't do it on purpose, but what the hell is that anyway?" and then, at the end, he says he has no problem with anything because his girlfriend loves him and he's "a good guy" but "I never will be." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was pretty disappointed in this book. I've been a fan of George R. R. Martin's work for a while now, and am looking forward to the next book in his Song of Ice and Fire series. I really wanted to be really excited for this one. Unfortunately, this book is not. The author does a very good job of making the characters of Jon and Arya memorable and fun to read about, but the plot is really meh.  It has some great moments, but I didn't think it had much of anything really interesting to say.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written to give us an easy way to read a difficult book. That is not what this book delivers. Instead, the author gives us a bunch of tips that are meant to be self-serving, rather than helpful. Instead of helping you understand the nuances of a difficult concept, the book mostly provides "do's and don'ts" on how to be a better writer. If you are going to read books on writing, make sure the author is also a skilled writer, otherwise the "do" list will just be a list of do's and won't be helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is not much going on in this book. I'm a long time Harry Potter fan, but this one really took me by surprise. The last few volumes have been really good, but in this one I couldn't really tell if there was any originality to it. I've seen that other people liked the books and it made me curious about reading it too, but I found this book a big letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As you can see from the negative review below, I wasn't too happy with this one. I've had trouble getting through books like this, and this one is no exception. The only thing that saved it for me was that it was my first time reading a book that I thought was going to be interesting and informative. However, I think I was just in over my head, and had to put it down quickly. I would give it an average rating, but I'm giving it a rating of bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, the authors give a fascinating and informative overview of the development of the Roman Empire from the first century B.C. to the fourth century A.D. The book starts with the period of the Punic Wars (241-201 B. C.) and then jumps forward to the decline of the Empire. This is a good book because it provides a good overview of many topics, including the political, religious, economic, social and military development of Rome and the Eastern Empire in general.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I read this book I expected it to be an entertaining romp through some contemporary American folklore. The book was mostly good except for two or three incidents that I found disturbing. The one that disturbed me most concerned a woman who went to visit her father on a farm but was captured by a vicious gang of thieves. She was tied to a stake, and a gang of men proceeded to rip her clothes off her body. After they were done, she was left for dead. The men then dug up her body, took her husband's clothes and buried her, leaving her naked and shivering in the middle of the night. The man she had married was not pleased to find her missing and demanded to know where she had gone. He was given no satisfaction. After that incident I couldn't take my eyes off the book. I can't wait to buy a copy so that I can read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you enjoy the Twilight books then you will love this. However if you do not, or are just not a fan of fantasy, then beware, you may be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book, as it was the one I had been waiting on for years.    Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it at all, and was left with a bad taste in my mouth.  The author had been very effective in marketing herself and her book to a wider audience as being about the power of the feminine.  But in reality, it was much more about how much better she was at being a woman than being a man, and this is where the true power of woman is expressed.  It seemed to be a combination of "how women are" and "how men are", and as a result, the whole book came off as being a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed in this book that I put it down, put it away, and put it in the trash.  I had no interest in reading about what she called the'reasons' for the poor health of people in America, but after reading it I realized I would have been better off if I had not bothered reading it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really hoping that this book would prove my theories about the nature of evil to be correct. However, I have to say that this wasn't the case.  As I said before, the main idea was sound and the conclusion was well made. Unfortunately, the book is too long to really get anywhere with the research. Instead, it only proves the main point: That the evil that is in the world isn't all bad.   The evil that appears in the books of the Bible is just a temporary evil.  The good in the Bible shows us that even the temporary evils that appear in the book of Genesis are good, if we only learn from them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is the very definition of a literary pretender.  He has a very superficial understanding of what makes for a good writing style, but no real understanding of the craft.  His work is filled with spelling errors, poor grammar and awkward sentences, which he tries to "improve" with a mixture of hand-waving, exclamation points and a smarmy "Hey! I'm an author too!"  It's not as if I found it hard to get through the story, but as soon as he started talking about "real people" and "real situations", I lost interest completely.  All he was doing was making me want to rip my hair out because he just couldn't keep it together and write a story about real people.  This isn't the first book in the series that I've skipped over because I couldn't be bothered reading any of the characters' backgrounds, but the characters are so bland and one-dimensional that I have to wonder why anyone would bother reading more of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read other "myths" books that have been good for me:  Myth #1: You can't win if you don't play the lottery  Myth : You can only win if someone else has lost  Myth: You don't really learn anything by practicing a language  Myth (2): You can always learn a new language  I thought this book was great for its subject matter and the fact that it's written by an ex-native speaker  It was fun to read  It makes a good case for why I think you can get better at languages by practicing (and memorizing) them
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you were looking for a great story that captures the essence of the Christian faith, then The Faith of the Last Days is the best one you will ever read. It's very engaging and entertaining from beginning to end, and you can't help but admire the authors ability to get such deep and rich information in a short period of time.  However, there are a few things that really stick out like sore thumbs.  First of all, the authors claim that "The Christian Faith" in no way "contradicts" Scripture.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what it does.  But in fact, the whole point of Scripture is to show us how to live with the contradictions.  It's just that the authors of the book don't seem to have the slightest clue that this is exactly what Scripture says.  Even worse, they make it seem like all the Christian world has ever believed is wrong (this is a bit of a stretch, since many people in Christian traditions have also believed some things that have turned out to be wrong).  Worse yet, they completely ignore all of the evidence that we have for the reliability of Scripture.   Finally, there is this:  One of the best parts of the whole book is when they present an interesting scenario about how the world would react if the Rapture occurred in modern times.  This is one of those rare occasions where the authors go beyond merely providing a scenario and actually try to provide some ideas about how this might play out.  There are two parts to this scenario, which we won't go into here, but I just want to mention a couple of things that make me feel a little bad about recommending the book in general.  The first is the idea that because the Raptured individuals would be able to return to Earth immediately, they would go right into the midst of the world's problems and begin solving them.  Again, this seems to be the idea behind the whole "Atheists get to come back into the world and save the world" idea that some people have.  To me, that seems a little desperate.  Would we really want someone who has been given a chance to change the world to go right back to where they were when they left it?   What if the returnees are so busy solving other problems that they do not even have time to solve the world problems they brought with them?  I'm not saying that the Christians who believe that the Rapturists will have time
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part of this book is the title.    "The Great American Hypnosis Book" is a terrible book.  If you want to learn hypnosis, this is a great place to start.  Hypnosis is so complicated and so mysterious that there is no way to just take anyone at their word and believe them when they tell you they can do something.  I am an experienced hypnotist who has read a lot about hypnosis and who is very skeptical.  However, I would not want my mother to learn to hypnotize me when she knows nothing about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My friends and I are now very aware of the terrible effect that some books can have on people.  The first time I read this book, my friends and myself were discussing our favorite books, and in the process, we found ourselves thinking about this one.  As we started talking about how it was one of those books that we were always thinking about reading, but just never really got around to, my friend started telling me about all the horrible stories about what happened to some of her classmates after reading this book.  She said that the author is really a good writer, but if people read this in school, they will never learn to take a joke.  I'm a little bit afraid of being one of her readers, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the kind of book you read and think to yourself, "that would be a great book if only it was written in the    modern   language of the time."  However, as it is, the book is filled with such   blunders as grammatical errors, omissions of pertinent facts and other   poor bookkeeping.  I am not sure I can recommend this book   to anyone  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My experience with this book was extremely unpleasant. I read a lot of biographies and biographies about famous people.  In this book, you'll find all of the usual things that you'd expect to find.  First, some "blundering" quotes:  "I had some doubts about it, and I decided it was not worth the trouble.  If I had known about the history of Hitler, I would never have done it"  The "I didn't know about the Hitler" line is used to make the character of Ernst Zundel seem like a lunatic.  I knew that he was a crazy guy  (he was a Nazi sympathizer and advocate for eugenics)  but I figured the guy was crazy because he was so crazy that he took it upon himself to become a Nazi leader, so I didn't really think about it.  Instead, I thought that it was a horrible choice by Zundal.  It's one thing to become radical because of what the Nazis did to you, but to then become a radical after the fact, like some kind of self-hating Jew  was something I couldn't believe.  A really big part of the book is about the way that he is demonized. The author quotes a lot from other writers, some of which were very good, and argues that Zundall should be considered one of the greatest German writers of all time.  So he gets some recognition as a genius.  He is a terrible, terrible person.  The last section of the memoir is titled "Who Was Hitler?  He Doesn't Look Like You or Me"  But the reason this section is so bad is that it's written by a journalist who just interviewed Zundell.  These are the same people who are praising him as a person. The only thing he actually says is that he did not read the "Hitler Diaries", so that's his only contribution to the book.  And of course, he has no reason to even mention that he read the diaries.  This is the exact kind of thing you'd hear from someone claiming to be an expert on Hitler.  There's no research whatsoever done.  Even if the author had bothered to read the books, there are enough errors and bad writing in them to make it a non-story.  One of the most obvious problems is that the book claims that Hitler had an "inner turmoil" which
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book for over ten years and I have never had the slightest bit of enjoyment out of it. The writing style is so choppy and confusing that I've stopped bothering to finish the entire thing. I do like the "How to Be a Person in the World" portion, however.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so desperate for information on the American Civil War that I had to read this book to know how to go about trying to learn about it. I have done a lot of research on the subject, but the fact that it was written by a guy who did nothing with the knowledge he acquired was an insurmountable obstacle. The book contains a few anecdotes about Civil War soldiers, but doesn't go into any depth. If you want a general overview of the conflict, you should get a more specialized work like the Robert Graves' "Ace in the Hole."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most frustrating thing about this book is how much more I want to love this book, but every time it tries to tackle the most important things about the book in one chapter, it fails horribly.   We learn about the importance of a good first draft, but then we learn about how much editing can help improve your writing.  But what do we learn in the most recent chapter, which is all about how to prepare to submit your book?  There's no discussion of where and when to submit, but we're given some tips and recommendations.  When you consider that most of the suggestions are to not even submit it in the first place, it really feels like the book is only concerned with how much it will hurt the chances of rejection.  (I also feel like, if it's not already, this book will help the next author avoid this pitfall.)  This is a book that is going to be on my shelf for years, if not a decade.  That's why I was so disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave up on this book after it made it to the Kindle.   This is another one of those books with a bad cover that I bought because it looked good on my phone.  I got it a day early to read it on my train ride home but the quality was so bad that I just couldn't put the book down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I'm reading this book, I realize I've been looking for a book that will be a perfect example of 'just right' in genre fiction.  This book is definitely just right -- it has all the right things to make a good fantasy.  It's realistic.  I've seen the movies and know what they have in common -- good writing, excellent characters, a good plot.  The characters are believable, and the story is interesting.  But it lacks the epic scope of a 'classic' book.    This was the right read for me, but I'm more of a fantasy guy and can't give it 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this book and then I realized I hadn't been to my local library yet.  There aren't many good romance books out there, so I was interested in this one.  However, I didn't finish it because the characters were just so annoying.  I could be a character and be really happy, but every character in this book just wanted to be in his or her own little world where no one else mattered. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found that the book, though it does contain some fascinating information, is a very disappointing waste of time.  A "good" novel is an interesting one, but this one is the antithesis.  It is too convoluted, too unoriginal, and lacks any of the excitement, excitement, and excitement that comes from reading an exciting book.  I hope the authors continue to write, but I am not holding my breath.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was as if some of the ideas in the book were originally invented by the book's author for her own personal enjoyment. It was not very interesting, or creative, or even entertaining, but it made a few interesting observations, most of them about the lack of imagination in American culture.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the early part of the book, I was a bit disappointed when I saw the word "paedophilia" in the book.  This was the first time I had ever heard of paedophilia in relation to the gay community, so I wanted to give the book a fair reading.  But the book then moved to the chapter dealing with gay paedophiles.  It contained a list of things that homosexuals tend to do that paedophilic people do not.  The problem was that this list was completely uninteresting.  For example, "the act of self-gratification by which a child is made to feel that it is important to have a sexual relationship with its own father."   What about, "to give the feeling of being valued and loved as a child by a child's own father"?  "To allow the child to feel special for having had sexual relations with its father."  Why is this even a thing that gays do?  In a word, they "become" children themselves.  And that makes no sense to me.  Why do they have to become like children, which they are not?  Why does a child have to have the feelings of a child?  I don't get this point of view, which is completely alien to the homosexual experience.  After reading the book I was even more disappointed by the section dealing with the "closeted and isolated" gay person.  I am pretty sure that I have been this person.   I don "clothed" up so that I would not be embarrassed in the presence of people.  As a result, I have found that people are more attracted to me as a person than as a sexual object.  Yet it appears that my only redeeming quality is my sexuality.  Is this really the gay experience?  If not, it is at least very strange and weird.    I did not find any of the homosexual characteristics I thought I knew about the gay lifestyle.  Like the "lifestyle" mentioned above, they were all extremely boring.  Even the gay paedophile is described as being "a victim of the patriarchy".   I guess what I am saying is that I did enjoy reading the chapter on "Paedophiles and Homosexuality".  It was interesting to think that in our culture, the only things that are really a taboo for people are child abuse and homosexuality.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I have ever read. I was going to pass on this book because it seemed so shallow, but in the end I read it just for the cover.   I understand that this book is supposedly about "the great depression," but as someone who was lucky enough to avoid the Great Depression, I can say that it is completely ridiculous to use a depression so severe as that of the 1930s to illustrate the pernicious effects of depression.  The only way I can make sense of the book is to assume that the authors read The Great Gatsby 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book extremely annoying. The book was just like a video, only better. If the author wanted to write about writing, then she should have called it "Writing the Way You Want to" instead of "Why You Do It That Way". The writing was lame and the formatting was bad, but it's hard to complain because most people like my book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very bad book. There is not one sentence in the entire book that is interesting, useful, or enjoyable. I mean really, this is one of those books that is so bad that I'm surprised it even got published.   It is simply an attempt to pass as a serious "scholar" while completely and utterly misunderstanding the whole field of science in question. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to this book, but I was surprised by the dull, repetitive writing style of the author.   There were lots of factual errors that the author made and could have been corrected easily.  She uses lots of outdated words, such as "humbug", "stereotype" and "shirking responsibility." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book, but it didn't live up to my expectations. It is an easy read for a middle school student, but even though it's fairly easy, it doesn't always capture the spirit of the book.  It's not difficult, but that didn't really help me. The writing style is pretty good, and the characters feel real, but when I had to look up words, I felt like I was using a dictionary instead of having a conversation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a fan of historical fiction and historical research in general, I was delighted to see that a novel was written about the American Revolutionary War. But my excitement was soon cut short after I came across the final chapter in which the author notes that the war was essentially a "civil war."   Why?  How could it have been any different than other wars in history when there was no such thing as "white," "black," "Native American" or "European"? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a kind of review of a bad novel: The plot, although not bad, is very disappointing. The story is set in the 19th century, when a man named William Faulkner went back to his family farm after being away in Vietnam. In the novel, he tries to find a girl who is part of his family's past and is supposed to be still living on the farm (something I found hard to believe). The result is that a lot of what he tries is simply not believable. The author does a great job of making the characters sound real, even though in the novel they're not very good at it. Faulkners father is one of the worst characters I've ever read in a book. He seems to have no qualms about killing anyone who gets in his way or being a bad parent.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is full of errors, omissions and errors of fact. If you want to be informed about a current or historical event, or have a need for historical documents, then read "Historical Fiction from the British Isles" by Robert Louis Stevenson, not this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is misleading.  The book is not about how to become an independent businesswoman.   Rather, it's about how she became one.  In other words, it is not a business book but a self-help book.  It is a very good book but not one I will return to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed with this book. In many ways I found it extremely condescending, in other ways extremely self-absorbed, and in still other ways just completely clueless about anything that isn't about her own experience. In the latter case, it's not a surprising choice: she's lived very much among the rich and famous, attended expensive and elite universities, is a former Olympian, and has spent most of her adult life immersed in the media. However, this seems to extend to a failure to understand anything about the other end of the spectrum, which is the poor and the poor (and the middle class, too, but that's a whole other rant). This is exemplified in a chapter titled "Blaming the Victim." In the chapter, Brzezinski tells a story about meeting with a group of poor kids on the Upper West Side. Brzezinksi, obviously not a complete idiot, assumes that the kids are homeless and are being abused. This is completely wrong, though Brzezik's main point remains unchanged: she wants to make herself feel better about herself. "They were so polite and sweet and eager to please," she remembers thinking. "And they talked to me about all the great things about going to college...and about having a good work ethic. I had to sit back and listen. That made me feel so much better about myself." Brzezinzinksy's tone changes completely when she realizes that the poor kids aren't homeless or abused: "No. They're just...bad at talking." Brzizinski ends the chapter by comparing her own work ethic and communication skills with the poor students: "I want to say something," she finally begins. "I had to work really hard at it. But I never forgot that there were people in the world who were less privileged than I was."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible.  This is not just a bad read. It's a horrible book.   If the plot was just bad, maybe it would be a good book. Maybe.  The characters are awful.  They are flat and uninteresting.  Most of them are despicable people. They are so dull that they are ridiculous.  All of them hate and blame others for their problems. The characters' problems are caused by a small group of people. The author is aware of the flaw in the characters, but fails to use it.  If there is one good thing in the book, it is that it shows that it is possible to be a complete and utter idiot without being the worst kind of person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most glaring omissions in the book are: an account of the discovery of the lost Book of Mormon and the subsequent legal battle to retrieve the lost book from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; a discussion of the historical significance of the "First Vision" in Mormonism; a brief discussion of Mormon history before the arrival of Joseph Smith, including the discovery and translation of the gold plates; a concise account of how Joseph Smith acquired the gold from Morgan and other treasure hunters, which is probably the most important fact about the gold he found, as it was a key to the history of the Mormons, but that information is never included; an account, which I found interesting, of how LDS members are expected to respond when asked questions about polygamy; and a concise summary of the evidence that the Book of Abraham was not a translation by Joseph Smith (it is a forgery).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I was getting into a nice genre when I picked this one up. I was really hoping for something that had a little more depth, that would be more reflective of life and more difficult to swallow than other books. Instead, the book feels like a cheap ripoff from the likes of YA. The main character, an 18-year old boy, is a social misfit who just keeps trying to fit in despite the fact that he has no social skills whatsoever. The world he lives in, which seems to be one big club to him, is one where anyone can have a nice party, even when they're drunk. There are other characters, one of whom is a girl who works in the clubs, and another boy who is part of the posse, but he just does what he's told. I'm thinking the characters aren't as well-written as the ones in YA, but I'm not really interested in reading about a bunch of poser teens. Maybe that's what the books were going for, but the characters in this one just felt too phony for me to care.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to a friend. The prose is very good, the ideas are intriguing, but the execution is terrible. The problem is that the author has very poor grammar and misuses apostrophes.  I also didn't understand a lot of the arguments or the conclusions she drew. She also often repeats phrases and sentences without explanation.  It was frustrating, but I understand that this is her first book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was pretty much sold by the premise of this book, but I found it much less interesting than I had hoped for.  While it has all of the elements of the "literary" genre -- plot, character, worldbuilding -- it isn't all that engaging.  The premise is interesting, but it isn  [In this new universe, there are three main religions: the traditional Jewish religion, the Protestant religion, and the ancient Islamic religion.  Jews and Muslims do not have the same rituals, and as a result have different beliefs.  To prevent this situation, the government passed a law requiring all religions to be identical.  This is the reason that some Muslim groups practice a strict form of Islam, while others do not.  They are still considered different religions, but each is allowed to have their own practices.]
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My review:  This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I could not read it on the airplane.  It was too much for me.   I would have loved to have read about how she met him instead of being told.  And the whole "love affair" with a boy who she thought was her father was ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say, I was not impressed at all with this one.  There are parts that are very hard to follow, and parts that lack much in the way of entertainment.  As a matter of fact, the "story" itself is basically just a collection of scenes, which are more or less similar to each other.  I could probably finish the book in a weekend (although I am looking forward to the next one), but it will probably stay on my shelf until the end of the summer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most glaring flaw of this book is the author's reliance on the unreliable testimony of one of the characters. The testimony is given to help a character who's a victim of a rape to claim that he didn't know he was raped and that a rape didn't happen. In this case, it is the story of a guy who's friend is getting raped at a party, the guy doesn't know anything about it, but because his friend is "so good looking" he tells his girlfriend about it. Then, the girlfriend's mother finds the guy drunk and naked in the woods one day. The guy was at the party, but he had no idea his friend was getting raped. So he goes and tells his buddy that he's the one who actually was raped, because he's such a good looking guy, or something. His friend tells his mom, and it's in a book! Then the guy is arrested and tried for rape, and has to tell his story. The whole thing is told through a narration of the book by the guy who was raped. It's a bit confusing, and also kind of a waste of a great narrator. The problem with the book is that it doesn't really take place in the guy's life at all. It takes place in his dreams and flashbacks and the book's narrator. This makes it impossible to take anything the guy has to say seriously.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. The characters were just one dimensional, there was nothing interesting about any of them, the plot was contrived and repetitive.   At one point, the protagonist was in an all nighter and decided to call in a favor from an ex-girlfriend. It was lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was going to be one of those great stories of how it is possible to have a life. Instead, it ended up being a depressing look at what it is like to be poor and lonely. I don't know why I waited so long to finish this book but I just never got it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to like this book but was disappointed when I finished it.  I'm sure that I will be reading more about this topic but I'm disappointed that it's so long and doesn't offer a lot of fresh insight.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is too long. It has one chapter on "cures for insomnia" (a classic, and there are many) that is completely unnecessary and does not address anything that is not already covered in the chapter on insomnia.   In addition, the treatment of "excessive night eating" (I couldn't bear to watch this episode of "The New Man" the other night, so I put it down and never watched it again) is almost exactly the same as "the casserole of doom" from Dr. E. Fuller Torrey's The Complete Book of Insomnia (1982).   That book covers the issue with great detail, yet is also much more entertaining.  I would not read this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not find this book in any used book stores; I looked for a week and could not find it anywhere.  I was hoping for some serious historical insights about one of the most important moments in the civil rights movement.  This book is the complete opposite of that:  No insight about the movement is provided.  The reader is simply told that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolence and "nonsectarian" message is wrong.  His support of economic equality and the right to marry was also wrong.    This is the first book I've read in a long time which was so badly written, it left me feeling angry, confused, and just plain dumb. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed by this book. The author has a clear and convincing argument for why we need to reexamine and reform our tax system, but what's really surprising is that he does so with so much hyperbole and exaggeration. He argues that the tax system needs to be completely overhauled if we're going to fund social insurance programs such as Medicare and Social Security. He even claims that in the past fifty years, "no social welfare program has ever been repealed with a good return on investment." Of course, we know this is just not true. The Great Society passed Congress in 1965 with a $40 billion budget deficit, and was replaced by Medicare in 1965 when the program had a $100 billion surplus. The Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, which overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest Americans, were a complete disaster. And even the most generous estimates suggest that the Bush tax cut was a complete failure. But all that's forgotten when the author tries to make his case with this story: My favorite story from this book is his tale about his father, a World War II vet who was a major donor to social programs. He was the one who convinced my dad to donate money to the American Cancer Society rather than his local fire department. When my father was young, he was convinced that it would be a good idea for him to join the Army. He took his ROTC class at college. The next thing he knew, he and his buddies were on the way to Europe to fight Nazis. Of course they found the war was a total and complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm disappointed by this book. I was hoping for an engaging, well written book that was filled with useful information, and that's exactly what I got. However, the book is filled with a lot of inaccuracies, poor information and inaccurate claims. There were several inaccuracies in the book that were just so silly that I thought, why did you include this in the first place? In one example, one of the children says that the "tiger and the bear" were actually a "turtle and a snake" that were separated by a fence. She's not wrong; the "big bear" is a very big bear, and the "small bear" has long been extinct. The "tough turtle" (as I called it in my review) is actually a turtle that was not at all tough, but rather a very weak turtle that would have been easily caught and eaten by a big bear. There are a few other such inaccuracies. Some of the information given by the author is also wrong. For example, he claims that there was a time when the "Papa Bear" was the only bear at the park. However he was actually the second bear that was released at the Park, and was the one who killed all the other bears.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I finished the first 50 pages and I was very frustrated by the lack of characterization of the main character. She seems to be someone with a lot of "life experiences" (I don't know if this is the right term, but the book doesn't go out of its way to use the word) but all the characters in the book seem to be defined by their past experiences. I found this very distracting and a bit annoying. There is a lot about life experience I don't care about and that's a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I thought I would learn a little more about how the media covers controversial and controversial issues. What I got instead was a list of things that I found offensive in the book. While it's true that most people can find ways to be offensive and be able to say things without offending anyone, I think it's important to remember that we should be respectful of the people that make up our community. Some of the things that were offensive in this book are just so unbelievably stupid that I was embarrassed by it. If I could be offended by this book, I would probably have a much harder time reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most uninteresting books I've ever read. I can't get into it.  I feel that all the characters should be dead, because they have no personality, no motivation, and no emotional investment in anything that's going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book to a good friend after she had been drinking for an hour and got really upset that I had said I liked the original Harry Potter books, and that they were much better. I had not. I was just annoyed by the way the characters were portrayed in them. This was one of those books that I wanted to pass on but could not put down, and I'm so glad I did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited when I got a copy of The Age of Wonder that I bought it. I loved that the world was one that I could imagine happening, but not happen in real life.  When the novel finally came out, I found myself so disappointed by it, that I went into the kitchen and threw the book to the ground.  A huge part of what I enjoyed about this book is that it presented a future where women were no longer oppressed.  But here we are, a few decades later, still having to deal with gender oppression.  I don't want to be a victim and keep getting dragged down with the rest of the world, but I also don't wish any of it would continue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad.  First of all, the author does not explain very well how a group of young men who all hate women come together and organize as a "band of brothers." The men do not speak in detail about the problems they face, but are rather vague and general. Also, the book is riddled with grammatical errors. This is not the first book I've read about a "bastard band of brothers," but it is the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm reading the first draft of an original work by a well-known academic. It seems to me like the original work is an attempt to use Marxist ideas in a way that is not really Marxist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a waste of time for the author. He tries to write about the most complicated and abstract subject - sex - in a very clear and simple way. But the more he tries, the more confused he gets. For instance, he says that sex is a "symbiotic" relation. But then he says something completely different. Sex is also "symbolically" connected with other things, like money, good health, power, respect, etc. But he says it symbolically - and that means that it is more of a matter of sex itself than any other factor. I find it very strange that this same author could describe himself as a "sexually liberated feminist" in another book. The whole thing is very confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first few chapters were good. I liked the historical facts and thought the author was accurate about the historical figures in it.  But then things started getting very weird.  It's impossible to explain, but I felt as if she was taking a page out of the book of the Little Rascals by Roy Huggins, and making it about a woman.  She seemed obsessed with the appearance of certain people in the novel, and I'm not sure why.  The most glaring example of this was Mrs. Risdon.  In the book, Mrs. Huggin looks very much like a woman, and yet in this book, she looks nothing like a Mrs. It was a very weird thing.  At other times, she was like a doll.  I'm sure I missed a lot of information about this, but at one point, she had a child with the actor Dick Powell.  They lived in the same neighborhood, and Mrs. Powell would have the child sleep in the living room.  However, when I read about this in the book I didn't find it to be much of a stretch.  While it didn't affect me too much, I did think the idea that a woman would have a child in the presence of her husband was a little too bizarre.  There were other things, too.  One person died in the first chapter, but then there was a sudden death in a later chapter.  Then there was the fact that the main character and her family were murdered in a house fire.  That whole incident could have been avoided if there was more forethought and consideration about this.  This seems to be a recurring theme with this book.  Not only is the book filled with inconsistencies and "one offs," it is also filled with scenes that just don't add up at all.  If I read it with the expectation that there would be some kind of a coherent narrative, I thought I was in for a huge disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book I would never want to read.  The writing was horrible, the pacing was terrible, the stories were lame, and the characters were one-dimensional and unoriginal.  Unfortunately, that is the type of book I find myself reading when I don't want to bother to read something. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is such a bad, boring book.   I found myself reading it because it was my daughter's reading book for her 8th birthday.  It took me quite a few tries to get through the first 100 pages, but by the end, I gave up and put it down.  Instead, I read my daughter this book that contains the same material and got the same results.  Even worse, she was bored the entire time and never laughed once.  For a book that claims to be about creativity, it sure as hell is boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My first impression of the author was that she was an intelligent young woman with an acute interest in literature and politics. She clearly loved and respected both, and her writing was consistently interesting. Unfortunately, however, as soon as the novel took on a political tone, it became much less engaging. The characters were poorly developed and there was not much suspense. The book was published in 2004, and has not been updated since. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished a good book about the Vietnam War, but with an entirely different point of view. It's written from the point of an American soldier who has been on the ground fighting for over a year, but was not directly involved in the fighting. I liked this book because of its historical perspective, because it was written by a former soldier, and because it told the story in a very clear and concise way. Unfortunately, it is also written by someone who has a very strong anti-war bias, and who often resorts to the use of "they" instead of "we".
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished John Grisham's 'Last of the Mohicans.' I loved that novel when I was a kid (because I was into westerns), but I never got around to reading it. So I bought 'Last Of The Mohicans,' and it was so much worse. It was also more fun. Now that I think about it, I should've stopped reading the book after 'Last And For The First: Parting Of The Ways' because I never enjoyed that one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem with the story is that it is too contrived and too melodramatic to be believable. I mean, I get it, it is the story of a group of high schoolers who have a series of bizarre adventures.  But the characters never act in a logical, rational, or even remotely believable manner.  Their reasoning always seems to be "we don't know" or "it's not fair,"  even though it's clear that they know for a fact that what they are doing is wrong and is clearly causing other people significant problems.  Even their motivations for doing the things that they do seem arbitrary and not necessarily in the best interests of the people they are trying to help.  And they always seem to do whatever they can to avoid the consequences of their actions.  In the end, the story comes out sounding like it's trying to be an episode of "Cheers" but it doesn't hold up at all.  I would recommend avoiding this book, since it's too contrivant, melodrama-ridden, and contrived for a believable story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back when it was published in 1981.  It was very good, and I still think that about it, but there are a couple of things about this book that I find   disturbing  .  In the beginning, the writer describes the relationship between God and the Virgin Mary.  She asks Him why He would make an earthly man the mother of His Son.  He answers that Mary is "the perfect being who has been made like unto man and who possesses all the divine qualities of humanity, such as love, pity, sympathy, and mercy."  Then the author mentions the "hieroglyphics" on the Shroud of Turin.  They contain the words "The Most Holy, the Everlasting, and the Immaculate"   The reader gets the idea that the author believes that Mary was a real virgin when she gave birth to Jesus.  Yet the most interesting part of the book is the explanation for why she was made of a different material than all other women.  In her account, Mary is told to place a little drop of blood on the tip of a thorn in order to give the Messiah's blood its special power.  Then Mary is asked to touch the thorn with her fingers.  When she does so, a stream of the Savior's blood appears.  Mary's response to this is that "God's blood is the key of this mystery."    It is interesting that the writer of the story makes no mention of Mary's mother, nor does she ask the reader to imagine the mother's reaction when she learns of the child born to the Virgin.  Perhaps the author felt that no one should ever ask those questions in a story about the birth of a child.   This story is one of my favorites in the Bible, but I do not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a huge amount of misinformation presented by the author in this book. The primary purpose is to portray a view of modern day society that is more favorable toward women. This is of course a very subjective view, but the author's opinions on social issues such as feminism and the welfare state are often unfounded. Furthermore, the author relies heavily on anecdotes and unverifiable statements to bolster his claims. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know how I let this one slip by me.  It started with an intriguing premise and ended up a total disappointment.  I am glad I finally got around to reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate to give bad reviews for books I enjoy, but I feel as if I cannot let go of this one. It is an exercise in fantasy which suffers from a few serious problems which prevent it from being enjoyable. This problem is the lack of realism. The main character in the story is a boy named John Smith who is a wizard who can see the future. The problem is that John Smith does not know who his parents are. This is not a minor detail that can be ignored, nor is it a matter that can easily be resolved by using magic to give the parents' names to the boy. If magic can give a child an imaginary father (not that this has ever happened to me), then why not magic that gives the boy an imaginary mother. The solution that John finds is to use magic to create a father from scratch and he is a very poor one at that. This gives the narrative a feeling of "magic" which is a bad thing in my book. There is also a tendency to make up characters. One of the main characters is named Mr. X, who is an evil wizard who has turned the world into a giant jungle. Mr.X's "power" is to create monsters, but in the process of creating them he makes them more powerful than they would be in the wild. This does not change Mr.R's opinion of Mr.L, a human boy. He also gets to turn into a dragon, which is the ultimate goal of most evil wizards. The best part of the story concerns Mr. L, a boy from Earth who is about to be sent away to an unknown planet to learn magic. Unfortunately, he has been caught up in a love triangle and he gets caught up with a beautiful woman named Julie. The book ends with Mr. Smith finding Julie while Mr. R has killed Julie and thrown her into the volcano. The story is not very interesting because there is little plot progression, but the magic is a gimmick and I did not care about any of the characters. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed by this book. The narrative is interesting, but it is written in a way that is far too condescending towards women. In this book, the heroine is described as "a smart, well-adjusted, successful businesswoman." This description is extremely patronizing to women who are more likely to struggle economically than their male counterparts. The women in the book are all portrayed as overly-sensitive and overly-feminine. They can be "too emotional." They "can't be reasoned with." The heroine, even when she does not realize it, is being manipulated. She cannot let herself be led around by her male counterparts because she is so deeply concerned with her image. The book ends with the narrator expressing disappointment that she never heard of the heroine. I think that this book is a reflection of the male gaze in the media and how the women who do make it in a male-dominated business are often portrayed negatively. This book does not reflect how I think about my business, but rather the stereotypes that women face in the industry. It is very difficult to be successful if you are not "perfect," but this book perpetuates these gender stereotypes and stereotypes of women who "can be argued with."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book.  A lot of it is tedious and pointless.  The author takes a lot of liberties with the original book and presents it as a sequel.  It's not, but the author also gets her facts wrong.  She claims that the title "The Lord of the Rings" is derived from an old English expression meaning "the good life."  I've read "The Tale of Bran the Blessed," "The Riddles of the King," "Othello" and "The Great Gatsby" and never found those expressions to have anything to do with the good life.  Tolkien himself uses "The Good Lord" and uses other phrases to explain his use of names, titles and places.  And it's not just in the books, the character names in the film are based on characters in other works.  They also give the same quotes in the movie that they did in the book...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book as an inexpensive alternative to the more expensive books.  It's good for that purpose.  I was surprised to find the title had a more negative connotation than I expected.   It is a collection of letters  from people who have been badly treated by the FBI and police.  As an author myself, I found these letters extremely interesting.  While they can't answer the question, "How did the FBI get me?"  I can answer the more important question, how can I trust the police with my own safety?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. I can understand people who are in love with books, but this one just didn't grab me. Not that I wasn't enticed, but it just didn ave little to me. My problem isn't with the book; it's with the writing. I found the book to be a little too preachy (something my friends usually find cute). And I felt a little sorry for the heroine, who seems a little bit too much like a stereotype for me. Maybe that's just me. I didn't enjoy it at all. I'll try reading it again, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot of this book is poorly thought out, the characters are poorly written and the story is poorly executed.   I'm not saying that the writing is bad or anything like that.  What I am saying is that the plot was poorly thought through and it was a total mess.  The story follows a woman who is trying to escape her abusive boyfriend.  This is an interesting concept, but the execution was terrible.  She ends up in a mental hospital after she tries to get the police involved to help her escape.  They don't believe her story that she's being abused, they only believe that she got kidnapped by her boyfriend.    I understand the concept, so I can respect the execution.  I just don't like how it was executed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book after my great reviews on the first two   but these expectations were dashed as soon as I started reading.  After learning about the life of this man, a slave who was held in a barn for four years as a child, I thought I might learn a bit more about the slavery in this country.  I found this book extremely dull and tedious  and I can only recommend it to people who want a quick read with little to no value added. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was in college and never finished it. I never found it interesting enough to keep reading it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did enjoy this book. It's not exactly the most interesting book ever written, but it's a good one. It was also entertaining and entertaining enough to get through. It has its share of problems, and while I wouldn't go as far as some critics have in saying that it's the most "anti-Christian" book ever, I do feel that there were some genuine insights in there. However, the book's overall tone is far too strident and hateful. The tone makes it seem like the author is trying to convince people who believe in a loving God to reject Christianity. While I don't agree with some of the tone of the book, I don' t think that it was the only problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor book:. The author clearly has not had enough practice in writing about real events.. She discusses, from her own experience, the horrible circumstances of a husband who beat her:. He beat her so badly that she could not even walk on her own two feet again.. He kept her in his home for two years, even while she was pregnant with their first child..   She says that she tried to escape several times, but could never get away, and finally she gave up on him entirely... It is a sad story. But the badness is only compounded by the fact that the author writes it in a manner that is not even remotely convincing.   The story sounds too much like something that happened in a real life, not in the story of a "true story." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished a very bad book. It was poorly written and badly researched. It doesn't make for good reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really, really liked this book. It's a bit difficult to review, because I really enjoyed it, but the main reason I did was that it got me thinking about race in America. It was the first book I read about race, and it was great to see that many, many years ago, people really thought race was a social construct. So it was interesting to see how much we've evolved away from that. But it's not that I think race is wrong, it's just that I'm interested in the history of the idea of race in modern American society. So I find this book very timely. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love reading good books but I really struggled with this one. The main characters seem to be completely defined by their relationships to the main character and it feels like the author didn't want to draw any of the other characters in because they might not fit into the relationship any more. In the end I'm sad to say the main characters never grow and never have any more interesting characters to meet in the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In contrast to the title, this book is not about the Holocaust. The subject matter is rather interesting, especially considering the Holocaust is usually mentioned in connection with the Holocaust deniers... the author's main concern is the use of pseudoscientific and historical claims to justify a political agenda... The first two-thirds of the book consists of a number of short essays and articles written by Holocaust denier David Irving. The remainder consists of Irving's own autobiography, in which he admits to having had a part in the murder of six million Jews in Europe and to having participated in the Dachau concentration camp. These statements lead the author to conclude that Irving is a 'holocaust denier.' Irving then goes on to argue that the Allies should not allow the Jews of Europe to emigrate to Palestine because Palestine is a country that had been ruled by the Nazis and was also a country in which Jews had suffered significant persecution. Irving's argument is that the Allied policy of allowing emigration is based on Jewish self-interest and that Palestine was a better option for Jews because it would be a safe haven. Irving continues by stating that he did not participate in the massacre at Dachaus or Dachung. Irving then quotes a British doctor, Richard Goldstein, who states that Irving'sensed his guilt' when he read the documents that had found their way to him. Irving goes on by stating his belief that the Holocaust was a'myth' and that Jews and Gentiles were of equal stature during the Holocaust (although, Irving believes that 'the Germans were the perpetrators' and 'the Nazis were the victims.'). This is followed by Irving's belief that there is no evidence of a gas chamber at Auschwitz. Irving concludes his essay by stating: 'The fact is that in the end we were all guilty of what our governments had done, and the truth will come out. And no one will be spared, not the Germans, not even those who took the part of the Nazi regime in the Holocaust, but no one.'"(p. 7) I have to agree with Mr. Pritchard that Irving's arguments are very weak. The main issue with Irving is that he is unwilling to admit that he has any legitimate objections to the Holocaust narrative. In fact, he states that he believes the Holocaust never occurred (see p. 20-21). Irving's refusal to admit to any problem with the narrative is evident in his autobiography, where he admits that he participated
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was so bad, I threw it out of a moving car.    I hated the first chapter on human nature so much, I started reading the next chapter in another book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm glad I read this book, and I hope others will too.  As a child growing up in the South in the 1960s, I was often told that "the South was the way it was" because there were no other ways. Now that I'm a teacher I find that view disturbing and unacceptable.  I grew up with the mentality of "the way it is" and it is completely false.  My parents never forced me to conform.  They just allowed me to make my own choices.  That said, it seems like so many parents today want their children to follow "the path of least resistance" and "the straight and narrow."  That way lies frustration, anger, resentment, and depression.  While my parents were tolerant, I don't think they realized how much it would impact their own children.  It took me until I was in my 30s to realize I wasn't happy in my current job.  In fact, I've found that more than one of my closest friends has changed careers because they were unhappy.  (I've been lucky enough to work for a company that I love!)  If you have been born and raised in the old South and think it's the way things are, you need to re-examine your own views. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book thinking that I would enjoy it, but instead, I felt like I was reading a boring story with no plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main characters are all pretty boring. It seems like they only do things to advance their own careers, but it doesn't really fit with the rest of the story.   I was never invested in any of them.  The author claims she's a professional novelist, but her books seem to be mostly rehashed versions of other people's works.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy this book at all.  It is just another collection of bad science and poor reasoning that I have encountered.  I am disappointed that so many smart, well-meaning people are so easily manipulated by these kinds of pseudo-scientific garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A horrible book. I have an extensive library with many titles, and this one has been on my "tried and true" shelf for years. The writing was sloppy and the characters completely uninteresting. The characters also acted like idiots the whole time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As with all of my bad book purchases, I found myself disappointed once I started the book. The author's use of the term "postmodernism" for the ideas expressed in The Fountainhead is quite inaccurate. Postmodernism refers to a distinct intellectual movement in the 20th century that arose from the breakdown of a number of Western European cultural and political ideals. These include: the belief in the supremacy of individual thought and creative expression over universal truth and tradition; the rejection of the idea of the eternal veracity of the written word as the ultimate authority on history; the abandonment of the Judeo-Christian belief that "the truth shall make you free" as the only true truth; the belief that human knowledge and wisdom should be formed by a direct interaction between the individual and his or her own internal knowledge and experience; the ideal of science as the apotheosis of human reason and insight; the acceptance of a form of cultural relativism; the concept of "naturalism" as an attempt to replace the Judeocentric God of the Bible with a "naturalistic" one; and the rejection or renunciation of a belief in absolute truth and absolute morality. None of these beliefs were particularly influential in twentieth century America, but the rejection is what most people consider to be postmodernism today.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I was looking for a good example of "old fashioned" non-religious storytelling, and this one was well done.  It took me a while to get past the first 5-7 chapters, but once I did I was very impressed with how well the characters and plot line were developed. I liked that they didn't try to be all things to all people, but instead made an honest attempt to be real. I think I enjoyed it more than many of the other non-fiction books I've read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because I wanted to see how someone who calls themselves a "rationalist" can actually do things that make them look ridiculous. I was very disappointed. It's like they took the common sense and logic from the Aesop's Fables and decided to add their own ridiculous ideas.   The author even goes so far as to claim that God can't exist, but we just need to believe in the concept of "supernatural" things.  In other words, there's no reason to believe that God exists.  I could never support that position, but it's the same logic that would lead you to believe God doesn't exist because he created the universe.  It's also the same kind of logic that leads you to support evolution if you believe in God. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I had a good grasp of the historical situation in which these characters lived and the various challenges that arose out of it.  I was totally wrong.  The book starts out well enough with a description of an early British attempt to deal with the problem of Irish Catholics in the English colonies.  But the author's main point is that the Protestant minority in Britain (the "English" in the title) is persecuted and threatened by Irish Catholics.  This is completely false.  Ireland is not a nation, as many in Britain and the Americas believe.  Its population is made up of various ethnic groups who have different attitudes and priorities about what they want and need in life.  There is absolutely nothing "oppressed" about Irish people.  They are not under the control of the British government and are free to decide what they believe and do.  And they are certainly not persecuted.  A Catholic priest, who is sympathetic to the Irish cause and has been a friend of the Paddy O'Farrell family, recounts a story of his experience in the prison system in Northern Ireland.  He says that after an Irish prisoner had been released, there was a mass burial of the bodies of Catholics, many of whom had been shot by the British.  That's right, Irish people are not persecuted in Britain. They are under the thumb of the English government, and we get to know all about it!  It also explains why the British want to have a "peaceful, neutral" Ireland in order to prevent Catholic nationalism.  When the "English," "Irish" and their descendants (the British "white Irish" of the past) were united, the British were forced to recognize Irish independence.  It's only with the British and Irish governments that they were able to form the Irish Free State and the Northern Irish Republic.  If the "British" had simply remained neutral, they would have had no reason to exist.  With independence came economic independence from British rule, which could have meant the end of British rule in Ireland. If that's what the "white British" want, they need to be told that.  At least that's my opinion, but it's the opinion of many people in England and Wales. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with errors of fact and interpretation, making a mockery of what should be the basis for good history. First, he ignores the many references to Thomas Jefferson and to his administration, including Jefferson's own notes in which he describes his work in developing the new state's first constitution. The entire Jeffersonian movement was a radical experiment, and the new states never actually had their own constitutions until 1776. Jefferson himself never said that he was creating a new "republican form of government," but he certainly was taking a significant step forward in the direction of self-government for the United States of America. He did not invent the state or "repudiation of the king." Jefferson's role in developing a federal system is well documented, but as I read, I began to wonder if he ever believed what he was saying. He described the national government as "a combination of executive, judiciary, and legislative functions" and noted that this was the basis of the "first political idea." But it soon became apparent that Jefferson was creating nothing new in this sense. A closer look at the documents makes it clear that he never envisioned a truly federal structure: no more than the Articles of Confederation. The Articles of Union created a government that was decentralized, with the central government being responsible for military and economic matters and the states for the welfare of their populations. Jefferson was actually quite concerned about centralization in the form of the United states, but he did not think it was necessary or even desirable. He never actually advocated for a national government because he thought that such a government would be unconstitutional and would inevitably lead to the end of a republic: "A republic can never endure long if the people sustain it with the aid of an executive which they do not control." I thought this was a very important point. Even as early as 1815, Jefferson was concerned that the national executive branch would be too powerful and abuse its power, and he was right. In fact, Jefferson even expressed his fears in a letter to Madison in 1817. In 1824, Jefferson published an article in the Connecticut Courant in which Jefferson urged the creation of a "state judiciary" to check the federal executive:  "The executive of the united States can do little more than what he thinks is right in relation to himself; and when he violates the right of the individual, he must answer to the people."  Now, Jefferson certainly did believe that "it is the right and duty of the people
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be incredibly disappointing.   The authors start out claiming that the purpose of writing a book about Mormonism is to "put to rest once and for all the allegations against the Church.  This is a very admirable goal and I commend this book for it.  However, I found that the book never really does that.  Instead, the authors focus on a very small number of controversies, and then go on to analyze these controversies as if they were problems that can't be solved.  The result is that the authors' analysis is largely useless."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a lot more from this book than what I got.  This is one of those books that really should have been better written in the first place.  The author is very good at introducing things, but he doesn't seem to be able to follow them up, and the writing is sometimes very repetitive.  I'm a big fan of good fantasy and science fiction, so I'm not one to complain about the "fantasy" parts, but this book just doesn't make me think that I need to keep reading, because I want to put it down a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books I don't enjoy reading very much at all, but can't help but keep going through because I've heard that it's good.  It is a very repetitive story, told from the point of view of a young man who comes to realize his dreams are just that - dreams, and that he's just a pawn in a cruel chess game with a cruel family.  This boy is the protagonist of this book, and as he grows older he begins to discover the true nature of his family and the dark secrets they have kept from him.  The way the narrative switches to a flashback when his mother was still alive is pretty frustrating, especially as the narrator never bothers to explain why he was allowed to read from that book in the first place, so I can't figure out what the point is.  I don,t know what I was expecting when I bought this book - I don't recall ever being enthralled by a book about a boy, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I finished this book but felt disapointed and was angry at the author for taking so long to write. The story is very interesting, the writing is fine, but the characters feel so uninspiring, and the main character, who I'd always imagined as an empathetic person, was so unlikable. This made me feel bad for the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most disappointing thing about this book: it is not written in an entertaining or clever way. The author does this by throwing in a lot of very irrelevant information in order to illustrate a few concepts or arguments, but he does not explain why this is relevant. He does this in other books as well, but this is the first time he does it in this way. Instead, he just uses this information to explain why he is right and everyone else is wrong, and to prove that he is the "true believer" in his position. This is annoying because it is so irrelevant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did like this book, but the reason why I didn't like it is the fact that all of the characters were so unimportant that they could have just as easily been cut from the story and the plot would have remained unchanged.  The author attempts to give the reader more insight into the people she is writing about and it's done well, but unfortunately it was done in such a way that the characters don't have any value at all to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book.  I think that a lot of this book is a mix of fiction and autobiography; but as you can tell, I haven't read much fiction by women authors.  As I have read fiction by men, this book feels like it's about one woman's life, and how she dealt with the aftermath of an abusive relationship.  Although I am enjoying the stories and the memoir, I was pretty disappointed with the plot.  The characters are interesting and believable.  But the story feels rushed and is just too generic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to get this book. I love sci-fi and horror and, well, I was really looking forward to reading about aliens and time travel. Instead, I got a book that sounds like a cross between Star Wars and a children's book about a ghost. This is not to say it's bad - quite the contrary, the aliens are awesome and the time travel concept is fun. However, the writing is clunky, the science not so much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been reading The World According to Garp for about three months now, with the first volume being published in October 2010. I don't know that I've enjoyed any of his books as much as I have this one.  There's something I don`t like about Garp as a writer -- or, at least, about his prose -- but that's hard for me to put my finger on. It's like he`s writing for himself. Sometimes it's a flaw in the narrative, sometimes it's an annoying literary style, sometimes, especially when he`d just as well make it about a group of friends who are just as good as he is (this was the case with the novel "The Last Word").  But I think it might be that he`re writing for the sake of writing. It`s as if he`ll take something good that`s already written -- like David Foster Wallace, for example -- and improve it until he finds the perfect way to say it: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the whole thing. I feel like a terrible person for wasting my time.  It's written in the    style of David Foster Wallace, in fact.   A really bad style,   that lacks originality and insight and is instead just a bunch of self-aggrandizing   statements made to sound like   smarts.  You know, like the  "If you are going to write a book, you should write one that will be read and re-read over and over again.  If you are really serious about writing a book and are willing to put the time and energy in to do it right, you will probably find this book   pretty depressing."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In addition to being an abysmal author, her lack of research and scholarship makes this an incredibly dull book. While many of her sources are accurate, others are not. The book starts out with references to various academic works, including several books by authors whose work has been thoroughly debunked by science, like Richard Lindzen. She claims to have reviewed some of the work she claims to "analyzed" and found to be "consistent with anthropogenic global warming," and then, after a quick look through them all, concludes that "in many cases [her] conclusions are strikingly at odds with these other studies." Then she cites several other works that she says "also show conclusively that [anthropogenic global] warming is a major cause of the severe recent warming." Then the "conclusion" that she is "convinced of" is that the "contribution from natural factors to recent global warming is so slight that it can be safely ignored." Then in the middle of the book, she says that "some researchers believe" that human-caused warming will eventually cause a "global catastrophe." And that's pretty much it. I had never heard of these people, but apparently they exist and are really quite serious. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to read this book after having watched the television series. The book didn't seem to have much of a plot, although there were some interesting twists.  The main character, who is referred to as a "witch," is portrayed as someone who believes that she is doing what is right, but is often frustrated by the slow pace of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was completely bored out of my mind by this book.  This is the equivalent of "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald - it reads like it was written by someone who was bored out-of-his-mind by the book, and didn't bother to learn the book's plot beforehand.  I wish there was a little more plot, but the first half of the book is a "I'm bored out my mind" "The story is boring so I'm going to read another book about boredom " 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea that the good are less likely to be believed, and the bad are more likely to have their opinions confirmed, is not something that I find attractive at all. And the idea that a good man, having been accused by his wife of sexual assault, is so traumatized by the experience that he becomes asexual, and has to have his way with a prostitute, seems a little extreme.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped this book would teach me how to better be a Christian, but I found it to be an over-long and confusing explanation of how the Christian faith is "obviously true" while still leaving many readers with questions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really disappointed in this book.  I enjoyed all of the characters, especially the two lead ones.  However, in this story there was no development of any of the main characters, so when we see them again in future books, we're treated to "that's so-and-so" as an explanation for how the two of them changed.  This is a very disappointing development. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried reading this book and had to put it down when I was through. The stories are all too familiar, and the character development is so poor. The writer has a way of writing that only adds to the drabness of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book after watching the film. I did enjoy the film, but this book seemed to have more of a literary vibe to it. It was not a bad read, but I'm going to give this one a low rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been waiting for the sequel to "Shadows and Mistakes" for many years. Now that I've finished the book, I am disappointed.  Although I liked the original, this one is weaker.  I found that the characters didn't have much depth.  There are no new insights or surprises that keep me reading.  The plot is repetitive and feels more like a set-up than an actual plot.  Even the ending, which was very abrupt and unnecessary, was not interesting.  Overall, I thought "Shades and Mistares" was a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As if trying to be funny is the best thing about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about an incident in my life which I'm sure will be well-known in the future but I just don't want to read about it anymore.  I'm embarrassed about the fact that I read this book after all these years.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with factual inaccuracies and poor scholarship. Its central theme is that the United States is a Christian nation and that its founding was inspired by the Bible. This is not true at all. The Constitution states, "The powers not delegated to the United Nations by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people." If the United Nation was inspired or created by the God of the Bible, then the Bible was never written at all. And for those who believe the Constitution is inspired by God, this book clearly states that the Constitution was not even written by men who believed in God. So, what did God say about the United State? In the Bible we find a lot about the evils of America, like the sin against the Holy Spirit: "I will hate them for doing evil, but I will love them for it" (Ps. 18:2). In fact, this is one of the most important messages in the entire Bible. It tells us that good things can come from evil; and evil can come out of good. This shows us that God will always use evil to fight for good, even in the most violent of situations. If God can use an evil country to fight against an evil American society, then God is the only real hero in this story. If this is true, then Jesus was also a man who used evil and suffering to fight evil. But how can we be sure that this is actually the true message of the New Testament? In Romans 14:18-19 we read, "Now if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, God commends the goodness of his will: otherwise, his good pleasure is unrighteous." If this means that God believes that his good will is righteous, then this is the best proof that the Bible is not inspired by a god. It is almost as if the Bible has been rewritten to suit the political ideology of the time. If America were a Christian society, the Constitution would not be an amendment. If the Bible were an inspiration for America's Constitution, it would not even have been written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Poorly written, poorly thought out. No sense of place, no sense of the future.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was my favorite, until it was over.   I just can't recommend a book like this highly enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book reads like a self-help manual for young people.  It spends most of its time in the first half discussing how young people should act in certain situations: dress modestly, avoid situations where alcohol is served, do not make a scene in social situations, etc.  The message is clear:  "Don't be like your parents!  If you do, they will have to do all the work!"  Sadly, the book is mostly about how young folks should act rather than telling young people how to act.  While the young readers may learn valuable life lessons, it may make it more difficult for them to find jobs in a recession or a financial crisis. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I enjoyed this book, I couldn't help but feel there were a few holes in its logic. For example, he says he has "lived and worked around a lot of the country" and that he "can't think of a single occasion in which a single government regulation saved a life," but yet he claims that in the case of the California drought, regulations "actually hindered progress." (If the state couldn't get permits, he wonders, why can't farmers? How do permits affect farmers? If farmers can't grow what they want because the state won't give them permission, why does it matter to the state that farmers can grow that thing?) He also says the drought is the result of "global warming" but then fails to mention that climate change has been linked to droughts in the past. Finally, he claims the solution to the California droughttor is "more conservation," but it turns out that California has taken the opposite approach and is already conserving the most water it can. Even worse, the solution is to conserve more water to begin with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first chapter starts with the main character looking at the moon and thinking about what a boring thing it is.   After all, he has never seen it up close, and he's been looking at it for a very long time. Then he imagines it is a little different:  As the moon rises over the mountains of Wyoming and the clouds gather and the lights on the moon shine on the mountains, it looks a lot like it does in the sky.  He realizes how much he'd miss it if it went away.  When he imagins it, it turns out that the moon doesn't really move, and when he thinks about moving the moon, he imagining it to be bigger, he realizes that it can't get any bigger.  The only way the moon can get any smaller is if it got closer to earth.  Then he thinks he would miss that.  This is the point in the book where the author throws in a few random quotes from science-fiction writers, because this is what makes the book interesting.  There is one from Ursula K. Le Guin, but otherwise, the quotes are really, really bad.  "There is nothing new under the sun.  We have just discovered something that was old before man discovered it.  It was not discovered by anyone.  But it is there, and it is beautiful."  "The first moon was only the beginning."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is not about the book at all. It is about a poor man. The poor man does not have a good life. He is homeless. He works as a driver for a company. His employer will not pay him more than $8.00 per hour. It costs more to buy food for the poor man and heat for him than he makes in a week. He also has no car and does not own a house. When the poor person falls sick, he has no money to pay for his medical care. If the poor people cannot pay the doctors or the hospital bills, they cannot get better. Their lives are ruined. The book tells this story from the viewpoint of the poor men's boss. There is not much of a character in the book. I wish that I had read it before I had this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is terrible   The only good thing about this book is that it is entertaining 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing interesting about this book.  It's a collection of anecdotes about how some women have had "bad experiences" with men, and others seem to have learned a lesson from those bad experiences.  These women, however, are always portrayed as women of good character who just needed to be taught that bad things happen to good people.  I'm not sure if the authors realized that their own experiences are not representative of the experiences of most women in general. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of the book (during which I was hoping to get a little information from the protagonist about her personal history) ended with an introduction and a preface written by the author and it's the most boring thing I've ever read.  I found that the only useful information they provided were for the introduction and the preface and that, in the end, they did nothing to answer the questions I had in mind about the characters.  The characters were, to be fair, fairly fleshed out, but the book failed to give me any indication that any of them are going to change their ways in the future.  It seems like they're there to be a foil to the protagonists.  Overall, the book was too long and the writing was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's main thrust is that the Soviet regime was a "cult" that "hurt people" and made them "feel like shit." But the evidence presented is so flimsy and poorly organized that the conclusion is hardly believable. The chapter on the gulag prison system has some good points, but there is no evidence that Stalin or others ever tortured people to make them confess to their crimes. One of the central charges leveled at Stalin is that he used the Gulag as a tool of terror. But in fact there is nothing at all to support that charge. In addition to the numerous confessions obtained under torture, one of the major problems in the prosecution of the Stalin trials was that most of the evidence incriminating Stalin as a "mass murderer" had been extracted in the course of torture and was consequently unreliable. The book tries to bolster the prosecution's case by showing how many confessions had been obtained under "torture" by others who had never been tortured. But that makes it seem as if the whole affair was something of a sham.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book, but I wasn't able to give it 5 stars because of its flaws:  * The ending is rushed and, in the process, doesn't really explain anything; * The narrator is unhelpful; * There's little description of the main character, and he isn't really defined; * We learn a few things about the author, but she comes off as somewhat self-serving and arrogant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As someone who has been an avid reader of the Harry Potter series, I was extremely excited about this book. As a fan of the series, this was a very disappointing book.  It starts off promisingly enough; Rowling talks about her childhood love of the books, and her own early desire to be a teacher like Snape (a great opportunity to play with the idea of having a teacher who hates his students.)  The plot is interesting enough, and the main character, Neville Longbottom, becomes the story's focus very quickly (though he is still far from a fully developed character.)  Neville has an interesting journey, including his relationship with Ginny, the way he deals with Harry's parents (the most well-developed character), and his growing love for Quidditch.  There's also a subplot involving Harry's dad, but even this is not enough to redeem the whole book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not sure I would like this book. I didn't particularly like the first book. However, my concerns were alleviated after reading the second book. The first book was quite lengthy, filled with fluff about famous people. The second book was much shorter (at less than 200 pages) and focused on a number of interesting characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is boring, the characters are boring, and the setting is boring.  There is very little character development.  I liked the idea of a magic school, and I like the idea that there are sorcerers everywhere, but the author keeps dragging her feet when it comes to making a believable plot.  Instead of a magical school, she uses an actual school for magic studies.  She is too worried about keeping her magic world a secret and not about writing believable characters.  In the end, there is almost no development. The author's point is that there is no magic in the real world, and that makes her characters more believable.  However, the fact that there's no magic makes her magic powers even less believable, and it makes the characters even more boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had so many problems with this book that I gave up on it.    It is a very poor excuse for writing a book.  The whole thing feels like a poorly researched and written travelogue for a tourist destination with a romanticized view of its culture.  It spends more time describing the cultural aspects of a certain region of Greece and then talks about their art, music, and fashion.  I don't understand how anyone could come away thinking that there is anything special about the region.  And, there is no real discussion of Greek history or politics.  For all of its good points, there really isn't anything about these topics.  Instead, the book focuses on the Greek culture in Greece.  This, to me, feels like an attempt to make something that isn't really Greece into something that is.  As a result, I don "t really get" the main idea of the book.     The only thing I found interesting in the book is that it talks about Greek myths as if they were real.  While I do think that myths are useful in our day and age to understand the world around us,  it does seem like there was an attempt here to write in the "Greeks" voice.  That's not a bad thing, by any means, but  it did not help to make the book more interesting or worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was difficult to put down. The main character is so well drawn that it is hard to keep him as a separate entity. He is so likable that it becomes difficult to root against him. The plot is a weak one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried reading The Secret Life of Bees as a "literary" choice. Instead, I found myself wanting to rip the cover off and throw it away.   The book is just a poor attempt at a science fiction adventure; and while the plot (focussed on the search for the source of a mysterious alien virus) does make for a good yarn, the narrative itself is just so unimaginative and unimaginative that I didn't care for the characters very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book, but it is nothing like I expected it to be.  There was a lot of repetition and some of the characters seemed almost caricature like (e.g. the "snowflake" or "nerdy" kids). The characters did little for me, but they were more annoying than "bad."  For the most part, the humor was fairly clever, although the characters were often a bit stereotypical and one character was so obnoxious it was hard to take him seriously.  Overall, this is a fairly funny book, though some of it may be dated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst part of the book is that it assumes that I have read most of what's been published about women and relationships... That I am, in fact, an expert and am able to assess this material as my opinion, rather than an objective evaluation of the evidence.  I'm sorry that so many books on this topic have come and gone in the past decade without me making much headway, but this one did.  As for the conclusion, there are a few things wrong with it.  First of all, the author doesn't seem to realize that what she's looking at in this situation is not "just being attracted to the guy," but a complex issue of desire, power, and responsibility.  It is a simple and effective concept that would work well for many couples.  But it seems to have been lost on this writer.  Second, there is a lot of talk about what the "perfect" relationship should look like, when it is obvious from what's come before that there is no such thing.  There's also a lot about the concept of "power exchange" and "giving and taking," which I will take up in another review.  For now, I'll just say that I find the discussion of power and the idea of "exchange" interesting, even though I don't buy it completely.  This concept does not mean that one person must give up their power, but that they cannot unilaterally control the relationship.  The end result would be a relationship that is equal in power, with the person in control of all the details, but where they also have to share in the responsibility for the relationship, such as making the day-to-day decisions.  One would think that a writer who does research on this subject would find something of value in this discussion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book.   If you don't want to read a book by a Christian apologist, avoid this one.  The book is bad, but not in the usual "book is boring" way.  It is bad in the way that it is bad from start to finish.  They use bad argument after bad argument.  I'm not sure how they justify their positions.  At times, the authors come off as too dumb to know what they are talking about.  Some of the book is just embarrassing, like the book on the Trinity:   "Atheists, they are quite simple creatures, are not well informed about Christian doctrine and theology."  I don't know who "They" is supposed to be, but I'm pretty sure they aren't atheists.  This would not be the first book to fall victim to the "trying to be funny" trap.  That doesn't make it any less bad, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In an effort to help children understand their bodies, the author of "Bodies" introduces our protagonist as having "unwanted" hips, which are, of course, her natural size.  She goes on to describe how children's bodies are like pieces of fruit and how she can't do things such as tie her shoes until she has "grown hips."  This is a horrible thing to say, as children's natural hips are perfectly functional.  Unfortunately, this book is marketed as an easy read for children.  It's not.  I will be returning to it as many times as I can find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed reading this book. It's a well written historical look at early American literature, but it's not very engaging. There were some really good historical and cultural references throughout the book, but they felt out of place in the narrative. I was hoping to get a deeper dive into the life of the 19th century writer, and the book only served to deepen my interest in that part of the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really hated this book. It was just too contrived. As an example, she has a "character who would like to be a model, but who knows that she's not beautiful and wants to look like someone else". When she looks in the mirror, "she sees someone who looks like her but who's so fat that she wouldn't be able to have clothes made for her". I would be interested to see what "an actor" who wants to be an actress looks like (she doesn't describe one for example), but it's just a contrivance for the book. I just hate her characterizations, and that's the thing I hated about the book: the "bad" characters. The protagonist (who doesn't even appear in the book) is called a "fearful, controlling, aggressive woman" and a "sourpuss" because she's a bit of a bitch. That doesn't make sense to me (she's a passive and caring person in real life). I didn't even like how she was referred to as "a bit of an evil genius".I felt like the story was being driven by her and her family's wishes. There was a scene where she was talking about her husband. She was angry that he left her and that he "lacked the ability to love and be close to me" (which is ridiculous because she has the perfect ability to have children and love them). She's angry that she was "lucky" to find someone who "wouldn't leave you" but "lacks the ability". That didn't make any sense to my brain at all. She's such a nice person. Even when she's angry, she's polite and doesn't yell. It just makes her look like an "evil woman".I really didn't like this book at all (aside from the parts I liked). It was so contrived and unrealistic that I just wanted to throw it out the window.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a great book, but it's full of mistakes, so don't expect to use it as a reference in your classes. There is no good chapter on the history of science, in particular the history behind the evolution of the biological mechanisms of living things. And the chapters on the evolutionary development of the sciences are largely irrelevant. The best chapters are about the scientific theories of a few prominent philosophers and about the evolutionist view of the world as described by Francis Bacon in the "Advice to the First Philosophers." Bacon's view, however, is outdated, and his ideas about the world are very problematic. It would have been better if the authors had spent more time on the ideas of Bacon and others rather than making their own (borrowed) ideas sound more impressive. I'm not sure how relevant the Darwinian theories would be to our day, but I'm glad they were included.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is pretty good, but the characters are ridiculous, and so the ending is just ridiculous.  I've read some better books, but this one is just so much over the top.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate the way this book was written.  I am not sure what made it so popular but it was a total disappointment.  The characters were flat and the plot just wasn't interesting.  This book is terrible and should be tossed into a fire and never seen again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a book that makes so much fuss about the danger of religion, it is pretty bad that it takes so long to get to that point. For the first 80 or so pages, religion seems to be much less scary than it is in the following pages. It doesn't help that the writing is so bad. I kept putting it down because I could never quite get over how bad the writing was.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't usually go for self-help books, and this one, while it is not very original or profound, is a pretty good one. I got through it pretty quickly with a smile on my face, and then moved on to the next self-improvement book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My expectations for this book were very high. I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series and particularly The Eye of the World.  I was excited that I was going to be getting another book in the series and, more importantly, a very well written book.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by this book.   It  did not live up to the high expectations I had for it.  Instead of being the definitive reference for the Wheel  of Time, this book is more like a very detailed (and in my opinion, very boring) reference for how many of the actors from the television series have tried to play various parts in the   books and failed.  While there were some interesting characters and parts to this book, I'm very disappointed in what it contributes to the Wheel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had an absolute blast reading this book.  It is filled with some of the most entertaining and insightful bits of scientific information ever.  Unfortunately, it ends up being incredibly boring.  As a result, it's a bit of a letdown after it starts off so well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think it is possible for a book about the Nazi Holocaust to be worse than the book that preceded it, "The Rise of the Third Reich".  The former, of course, is the standard work on the subject, while the latter is a compendium of the horrors of the "Final Solution".  In the former, an American academic examines Nazi war crimes in great detail.  In contrast, the latter includes only a few relevant pieces of information, and even those are from the perspective of an enemy of Germany.  I had to re-read the book, as I didn't find anything that seemed entirely new or interesting in the latter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot of the book is so bad, and so weak, that I found myself thinking about the badness of the plot of every book I've ever read by this author.  I think I'm the first person to ever express this opinion publicly, but it strikes me that it's more a criticism of her writing than a criticism against the book itself.  She's simply bad at creating a compelling plot (which is a pretty crucial aspect of any good story).  I'll give a few examples from the first 50 pages:  It would be easy to describe this book as an exploration of the history of the Vietnam War.  It does an excellent job at exploring the conflict by focusing on the main character and his family's experience living during the time the war was occurring.  Unfortunately, the book falls back on stereotypical stereotypes and clichés in the process.  One of the characters is described as "tall, lanky and handsome" and "proud" (he was a Vietnam veteran).  Another character is described by the main protagonist as having a "lush beard" and being "not a particularly handsome or intelligent man."  A few other characters are described as having "large breasts" (one of the women has a tattoo of the Greek goddess Athena), "thick lips" (the main character has a mole under his lip), and as "thin" and having a small "butthole."  It's not uncommon for a narrator to make these kinds of comments in a book, but I found it especially disheartening to read them in the first chapter of a book by a prominent writer.  If I had any other negative criticism to offer, I'd say the main characters are a little stereotypical, but otherwise the book does a pretty good job of exploring this conflict. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a world in which good ideas, good literature, and good science are constantly threatened, it's good to find books that offer hope.  In the interest of full disclosure, I found this book to be more interesting than a great deal of other modern science-based literature, but it is still a bit dry and a bit heavy on the religious content. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how to respond to this book, but I must. I've only ever read one book that really stuck with me: Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion (2006). This one is so similar to that book that it can't help but leave me with a nagging feeling that the authors didn't get the point. They make many of the same points as Dawkins, but they're presented in a manner that seems intended to make them less powerful and more trivial. For example: The "problems" with evolution have already been addressed and refuted countless times by biologists, and no new arguments are being offered. The arguments used in the book are usually from a place of ignorance. So why include them? Because they sound good. This book is clearly intended for the intellectually lazy who want to believe in a God so out of touch that he couldn't be bothered to get up off his own arse to create a world that had even a fraction of the potential that life has to offer. But this book is so poorly written, so poor in ideas, that it only serves to reinforce the idea that they are indeed "in their own little world". I suppose you can say it's a religious polemic. But that doesn't quite capture the true nature of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you really want to be outraged about the stupidity of our culture's worst authors, start with "The Fountainhead" and read "Atlas Shrugged."  If not for the sheer awfulness of those books, I'd probably still be reading them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My friends told me this book was "bad", that the narrator sounded like a teenager. It wasn't bad, just a little boring. But, after giving it a couple of tries, I decided to give it a chance. I was disappointed. The narrator sounded as if he had done his research and was only reading the words that were actually in the book. The writing style wasn't the worst, but it wasn't good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love how this book was so full of facts and quotes and quotes from so many other great books that I thought I was missing something. However, the thing that stopped me dead in my tracks was the amount of times she had to use the word 'vagina' in describing a woman's anatomy, and how she uses words like'slut' and 'whore' in reference to women who have them. This is a book for those who enjoy the sex stories in books like  The Big Gay Book of Big Gay Sex  or those who want a good hard-hitting book about sex without being preached at. The author does have some good tips, but it makes me want to run back to my sex education class and read a few more pages about different types of vaginas. The book ends with some tips on how to get a 'true' vagina:
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for class, and I was completely dissatisfied.   A few of the reviews that I read were from people who really enjoyed it.  I don't.  There are too many typos, inconsistent narrators, and a lack of originality to recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had so much fun reading this book. I'm not much of a writer and I had a hard time keeping the sentences together. I ended up reading it in one sitting because it took me ages to keep up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited for this book, and found myself wanting it more and more over the time I spent with it.  In spite of that, I found it somewhat disappointing.  The narrative was very well constructed and the narrative was pretty good.  However, I was also frustrated and confused by the narrative and what seemed to be a lack of focus throughout the book.  I never saw any direct evidence that Joseph Smith was using his seer stones for the translation of the Book of Mormon.  He is simply doing this, without an understanding of the potential for spiritual problems, using a set of stones in a box (or a hat).  There were many other problems.  There was no clear explanation as to why the Book Of Abraham was published in 1844, though it was not translated using his stone.  It was later suggested that the stones were the keys used to translate it.     What was confusing was that Smith was not sure what he was translating, so he made up explanations.  What he was trying to do, though, was explain the purpose of the Bible to the public.  His explanations varied, which caused his revelations to be contradictory.  Finally, he was forced to say that it was no longer the intent of the Church to translate by the use of the seer stone, but that he had been given the gift of translation and that his gifts were now sufficient to accomplish that.  As a reader, I didn't feel quite as confused or frustrated as I should have, but I did wish I had understood more clearly what he meant when he talked about the use and importance of the stone, and when he said that his translation was inspired. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book but was disappointed with it.  I'm an old-fashioned reader, and I've always found the stories in these types of books (and all literary books) to be inferior.  Most often, the authors tell the story through their characters.  For some reason, I find it difficult to connect with these authors, and while I enjoy their novels and poetry (like all of us), the stories seem to come off as a chore or an exercise in contrivance.   The main characters in this book are very flat, and it's easy to see how a few more pages could have enhanced the novel.  Unfortunately, the story itself is far too long and uninspired to enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would give this book a 1 star, but I can't.  For a good book, this one is a train wreck.  I understand the concept of the story, but not the details.  It's all about a boy's discovery of a body.  He's fascinated by it, and asks his parents about it, but they don't know anything about it.  And so, in a very unsympathetic way, he starts searching for clues about the body, which turns into a quest to locate the family of the child, who disappeared from the house years before.  No big deal.  Then the body turns up.  This is just another story about a child discovering the body of a murdered child.  You know, the usual.  The body turns out to be a boy, who is now in his 30's.   It seems like this boy died from a sudden heart attack, but he just went off the rails some time ago.  In the next book, he gets sick, and then disappears.  After that, he's still missing.  But the child he found is now also missing.    In a way, the book is about a lost child, but also about a dead one.   It also seems like the author is attempting to make up for the bad parts with the good parts.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book. The title seemed interesting. I read several reviews of the books by a number of contemporary authors about women in the Renaissance.  Unfortunately, I found much of it to be shallow and overly optimistic.  The story of a young girl who is forced to hide her age from her father is interesting and I will be interested to read more about the girl.  I found a lot of the women portrayed in this book to be over-hyped and unrealistic (although not without their merits).  As I read the novel, I started thinking that the author might be a bit of a dreamer. I don't think I would have wanted to be her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife and I were very excited about this book, but we both felt that it didn't live up to the hype. It's basically a re-hashing of the same old things that many people have been saying about the book, and it's a bit boring. I have no problems with the book's message, but the writing really drags it down a bit.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was going to be the book about a woman who has to deal with a man who's had a string of bad relationships and is in the process of getting out of them all. This is definitely not it. A lot of what she is going through is just trying to keep her sanity. Even though her past relationships weren't bad in and of themselves, there was a complete disconnect between how she felt about them and how he felt about her. He seemed to think he knew everything about her and that there was nothing she couldn't teach him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a very poor book about people who have done the right thing but didn't realize that they were doing it.  It was pretty much written by a young person who was brought up not to think critically about things but to just get her way, and didn't grow up believing that people were capable of making different choices for different reasons.  The main character is an author (who is very nice) who is trying to write her book about a former teacher who is going crazy after she is fired (the school says she is not fit for the job) and doesn't know what to do about it. I'm very interested in seeing how she reacts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very long, and contains numerous errors and confusing explanations. However, the content is interesting, and it is certainly not my favorite book on the subject. It is an interesting case study of how religion and science can be so hard to reconcile.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has been on my radar for a long time. I've seen a number of reviews about how it's really "bad" and "stupid", so I was really looking forward to getting a chance to read it.   But I was surprised to find that it's not really bad at all, and in fact, the author's opinionated, well-researched and erudite writing makes the whole thing more enjoyable than some of the reviews would suggest.  While it's true that there are a few factual errors, and that some of his opinions are a little misguided, I think that most people who are disappointed by his book are probably reading it in bad faith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem is that the author has a strong bias against the work of other feminists. She writes, "The word "feminist" is a word with two meanings. The first one is that feminist is a person who believes in the social and economic equality of women. "It can also be used as a noun, for instance a woman who was a feminist. These are two distinct meanings. Feminism is not just a belief in women's equality but in the equality of all genders. As such, feminism has to be viewed separately from other ideologies such as anarchism and Marxism. "I would have preferred to include the first part of the sentence, but this is not what is most important in the history of feminism. The second part is most interesting: "The other meanings of "feminism" are also significant, but it is these two meanings which the author focuses on in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you hate anything, read this book.  If it were to be written about another person, it would be about me.   A guy named Frank tells us how his love of the Bible has caused him to lose his mind and commit many crimes while under the influence.  I don't believe he's telling the truth, and I don'st blame him for his actions.  He does have a way of being persuasive and convincing.  The thing that kills me, though, is how he manages to make his victims look worse than they were.  When I first read about this guy, I thought he was an extremely sick and evil person.  Frank claims that Jesus died on a cross to show us that God would forgive us.  Unfortunately for him, the only thing he got out of the story was that he'd never get to hang out with Jesus any more.  Apparently the only reason Frank ended up in prison was because he kept his mouth shut about the whole thing.  As I've said before, it's difficult for me to believe that anyone would believe anything that this guy writes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a bit of a stretch to say that the book is "very good" in every possible way, but given the time constraint that I had to work with on this review, it's the best I could do. It's not a book that you read in one sitting, but it can be read over several days or over several months, and if you read it with an open mind, I'm sure you'll have some new ideas about things you've thought about in the past.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to be honest and say that I found this book to be quite the disappointment.  I don't mean that it was poorly written, because I liked a lot of the book, and I am still reading it, but I felt that the main problem was the author's tendency to overuse his protagonist's religious beliefs.   The religious beliefs of every character, from the most fundamentalist to the most liberal, were taken verbatim from the Bible.  It didn't help that the Bible was written many centuries after the times in which it was supposed to be set.  The author tried to insert religious references in a way that seemed to suggest that the writers intended to imply that the characters' faith was actually true.  To me, it sounded as if the characters simply thought that it really was so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when I was a little girl and it stayed in my mind. My dad never said it was bad. However, the story is so bad, it made me cringe. The characters are terrible. I can see why my dad would enjoy them. I just wish that they would stop.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read.  It is filled with lies, distortions, and omissions.  There is nothing good about it.  In one case, she refers to a well-known critic of the novel, an Italian writer named Luchino Visconti.  But Visconto's books never contain such blatant plagiarism as in This Side of Paradise.  As a writer, Viscount's writing is sloppy, sloppy, and sloppy.  The plot of the book is also terribly contrived.  Readers are promised an exploration of "the inner lives of a dozen different characters."  But there are only six characters in the book.  One is a character from a previous novel by another author.  She spends most of the time in prison, which is the only thing that is really the same about her and the others.  I'm sure that she is a great character (but not this book), but she could have been a better focus for the narrative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping this book would help me learn to cope with the pain and suffering of my terminal cancer diagnosis and the ensuing six months of grueling chemotherapy. It seems to be very "repetitive" and "predictable," yet none of the "tricks" work to my satisfaction.  After an hour with this book, I have already realized it is basically a set of vague suggestions about how to cope.  There are two things I disagree with. First, the book mentions that "when the cancer eats you alive, it doesn't know when to stop eating."  In my experience, the more time I spend trying to avoid the cancer's hunger, the less likely I am to find a way to get it to stop (this includes fasting, which the book implies I should try, and taking lots of vitamins).  Second, I find it difficult to believe that anyone, or any disease, can "know when to quit."  Is there such a thing as a "cancer quit"?  The author is a very nice person, but I find her book frustratingly repetitive and lacking in useful "treatments" for cancer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in order to prepare for a medical residency, so I was very interested in the book's advice about smoking marijuana. However, as soon as the author revealed that she had smoked cannabis in her younger days, I was left with a bad feeling.  She states that she was "unlucky" and "struggled" with a "drug-induced psychotic episode."  However, this episode occurred in an extremely difficult period of her life - she was trying to cope with the death of her father - and she was not at all in control of her behavior at the time.  This was a period of extreme stress, and she should have known better than to start smoking marijuana before she really needed it.  I found it difficult to believe that a person as highly trained and intelligent as her would make such a poor choice.  Although this book is written for medical patients, I can't help but feel that it would have served equally well for non-medical readers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't particularly like "The Great Gatsby" and I have not read the novel so I'm not entirely sure how much to say about it.  I do like the book and it's one of my favorites of the year so far.  But it's a bad read and the reason it's bad is that it's simply bad.  There are several things in it that just seem off to me.  It is quite possible that I'm reading this for some kind of ironic purpose but I think it's more likely that this is just a bad example of how the genre works.  The writing style is uneven.  For a good book, it would be a good idea to have a good and consistent author.  One of the problems with Fitzgerald is that he wrote so many books that it gets difficult to keep up.  This one's the worst by far.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.   There were a couple interesting points, but overall it was just meh.  It seemed like a lot of the points in the book were made in another book by another author   ( http://www.amazon.com/Wine-and-Chocolate-Cravings-Frequently-Asked-Questions/dp/0312154788/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1325011623&sr=8-1&keywords=wine+and+chocolate )  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book.  It is a very poor attempt to use "science" to try and prove a theory and an unproven belief.  The author claims that there was a "consensus" among scientists that the Earth is flat.  This was in the 1970s but even then it is very questionable that there is any "consent" in scientific studies.  In fact, in fact, even the author of the book concedes that there are serious flaws in the science that he uses in this book. He doesn't even use the "conspiracy of silence" theory that has been around for decades.  He just throws in the "flat earth" conspiracy idea just so he can say that the world is flat and has been for thousands of years.  As if that isn't bad enough he then uses the "flattening of the earth" concept as part of his claim that the scientists have conspired against him.  If this is how the scientific consensus has worked in the past, why would anyone believe the flat earth theory today?  He also tries to link this supposed consensus to the Flat Earth Society (which he claims was created by the "scientific consensus").  He has to admit that there have always been dissenting voices and that people who reject flat earth beliefs are not always considered scientists.   The "consistent flat earthers" have no consensus at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about something called a "fleshly conscience" and the process by which it develops. The author, who is a physician, claims that by developing a "feeling of moral superiority," a person can resist temptation and live an honest, moral life, even while engaging in immoral acts. I don't think he can really support this claim. The only time that he explains what the "feels" are like is when the character who has developed a "sense of conscience" is contemplating committing adultery. The reason that he cannot convince the character that committing adultery is wrong is that the character is too ashamed to admit to himself that it is wrong. But that is really the point. The character is not ashamed of his bad habit, because he has "earned" the right to have a "good conscience," and he wants to maintain that right. The moral right to live a moral life has nothing to do with the character's being ashamed, or the character knowing he has the right.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started reading this book with high expectations. However, these expectations were quickly dashed by the book's overall negative tone. This is not the work of an intelligent writer, nor of a sincere devotee of the truth. It is the work a writer puts in so he can be noticed by his peers. The tone of this book is self-deprecating, in part because the author acknowledges his own failings and weaknesses. In another section, he points out that he had been a child who had grown up believing he was above others; he then states that he now realizes that this was not so. At the same time, he shows that he has been far from a bad child, but he has also grown into a man who is "bad" and "good." This book is an attempt to explain his belief system by way of example: that the real bad boy in a group of good ones is the one who is not recognized as a "bad boy" at all. If you want to avoid the consequences of bad behavior, you have to try to appear bad. If a person doesn't like the label "bad," it is only a matter of time before he or she has to admit it. For the author, the real problem is that everyone has to be on his or her toes at all times. One cannot simply act "nice" and expect good things to happen. This book doesn't really work well as a defense mechanism. However one cannot complain about a failure to give a bad boy a bad name. If he had given the boy a name like "Mr. Nice Boy" instead of "Bad Boy," he would have been better prepared for what was to come.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best book I have read in years. I've never been a huge fan of Stephen King (despite the fact that his books have inspired many of my favorite movies and books) and I have never been much of a Stephen King fan.  But  this book   is perfect   It is well written, well written in a very Stephen King fashion   and is the kind of story that the author is so very good at creating.   I can't wait  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of books and was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, I found this book to be nothing more than a pile of bollocks with no intellectual content at all.  A collection of meaningless "facts" about the military, history, and science, with a smattering of "philosophy" thrown in.  It is just a lot to take in, and the "facts"... well, they are mostly nonsense. The "history"... well... well, it's just a rehash of old, tired lies. The scientific stuff is so poorly done that it is difficult to believe it's even published.  I would not have read the book at all if it were not for its bad review in Amazon.com
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book and wish that I could give it zero stars.   This book is a hodgepodge of religious, political, and historical information, and it is presented with poor formatting and poor grammar.  It is the worst book I've ever read by a non-native English speaker, and I can't believe that the publisher thought that it would sell.  While the book claims that the Bible is "the most accurately recorded work in history," the author does not provide any references for his claim.  He uses several quotes from Christian scholars as though it is some kind of scientific fact, and even claims that "many scholars" think that the Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible are the earliest copies.  The author even claims to have researched the subject in depth while claiming that he "found a few problems," but then gives the author's answer to those problems.  In short, the author gives his opinion and then contradicts it with his own opinion.  As an expert in ancient languages and religious history, I can tell you that he's probably right on one or two of his "questions."  In other words, he "gives his opinion" that the "gospel of Jesus" is inerrant and that the original manuscript was in "the original language of the Hebrews" while also acknowledging that some other scholars think that it's "in some foreign language" and "is probably a later scribal error."  As for the problems with the Bible, I don't think that they are too serious, but the author is still presenting a flawed book.  I just hope that he has the sense not to write anything else that is this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book hoping it would provide a different perspective on some of the major events in American history. Unfortunately, the author is unable to do so. He seems unable to provide anything in the way of useful insight into the events in question. As someone who was born in the South during the time he describes, this just leaves me feeling that I have been sold a bag of crap by someone who has made an investment in an unworthy subject. I would recommend this book only if you are a history buff who is looking for a new way to look at things.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got so disappointed by this book that I put it down midway through and put it off until the next day to finish it. It is a very strange book in that there is no plot, no real characters. It just spends a lot of time on what a "perfect" marriage is like. The idea that a couple should be "like water and oil", and "inseparable" is so far removed from real-life that it is unbelievable.  The author seems to think that marriage is a one-way relationship, but that is not how it works. It takes a lot more than being "one of the boys". There are lots of compromises to be made, and there are lots (if not most) of good guys and bad guys in any marriage. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back in high school. I had a lot of trouble with it. The prose was so dry I didn't have much to say and the book didn't quite live up to its hype. I'm glad I got around to it a couple of years later but still feel this is a book I'll be very leery of recommending to others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the most confusing and frustrating book I've ever read. The information about asexuality was confusing, because they don't know how to differentiate between different types of asexuals. The lack of descriptions of different sexual practices made the author's statements seem vague and unconvincing. There were lots of statements that seemed to be made out of context and were obviously wrong. There was also a lot of information about non-asexual relationships, but that wasn't mentioned enough for me to understand why it would be important. The asexual section also got a little repetitive, as the author would explain asexual attraction and then describe a non-sexual attraction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited to get this book, as I read it in high school and have always wanted to read a Harry Potter book. I expected that it would be the same as the previous books in the series, but I was totally wrong. This book has absolutely no story line. Instead of telling Harry's adventures, this book is mainly told by Hermione. And there is absolutely no character development for any of the characters. I never cared about Ron, Ginny, or Harry after the first two books, and it is extremely disappointing that Hermione has so much less character development.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be very confusing and incomplete in many places. It was quite a letdown when the author had me reread the first chapter and I had not found anything new. The book was published in 1998 and has not aged well. The only other book I know of that is based on a true story that happened in the late nineteenth century is "The Ghost of the Virgin Mary," but I found that book to a boring, trite and simplistic story. This book is much worse. This is one of the few times I have read a book that I hated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so filled with false assumptions, half-baked logical fallacies, and outright fabrications that it reads as if it is a collection of the opinions of some of the worst people I've ever encountered.  It's as if authors were forced to submit their books to a book-club for critique before the final manuscript is written, which is a way of saying they didn't know what they were doing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It's so poorly written it's embarrassing, and it reads like a very poor first draft.  In this book, a female writer is "disillusioned" by her husband, a male editor. She's not, in fact, disillusioned, but she feels like she's been taken advantage of. She feels guilty about her feelings, and doesn't want to tell her husband (who is an excellent editor) what she really feels.  As a result, she becomes depressed, and she blames her husband for what has happened.  There are many problems with this story. It reads as if it was written by an unhappy woman who hated her husband. It also reads as a poor attempt to write about female experience.  It uses the phrase "disinhibited" a lot. What the heck is that?  It's also hard to believe that a woman who writes for women's magazines would feel the need to include all women in her writing.  I was not happy about this book at all, and I'm not sure how much better a book would have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book, but the author is very self-absorbed and arrogant in her opinion. She claims that people have a hard time accepting her opinion and she has to take it on faith. This is very frustrating and makes it difficult to have a respectful discussion with her. I found myself disagreeing with her about almost every point and I can't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book while on the road and it was absolutely appalling.  I would rather have the title of a bad movie:  "I had to read a bad novel to prepare for a bad one"    The author writes like a complete idiot, makes many of the characters seem stupid, and doesn't know how to write a coherent sentence.  As for the content, it's bad.  The "how to" chapters could have been written by the author himself.  It's the type of book that you can find in a used book store or used library.  And it's not just the content:  The editing is awful, with grammatical errors, poor spelling, and missing words.  So is the narration, with the author giving a flat, monotone voice that reads like he's giving advice to an audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is boring and unoriginal.   No real research was done.  The authors' ideas and descriptions are vague and the ideas are old.  Even the first half of the book is about the development of the word "sex" in Western culture, the ideas of the origin and function of the clitoris and penis, and the fact that the word has become associated with evil.  A very dry, tedious and unproductive book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a huge fan of dystopian fiction but I still thought it was interesting to read a dystopian novel that wasn't all about the end of the world.  There was still plenty of humor and plenty of action.  I liked the characters so I enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a horrible book about bad religion. I do not have a problem with religious extremism. I myself am an evangelical Christian, but I see that this book is very anti-Christian, and is more a rant against Christianity than a critique of religion.  The author does not discuss Christian theology, nor is he interested in discussing any kind of Christian theology or theology. His book is just a rant about Christianity and the author seems to be a fan of anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish writings of the late 19th century and early 20th century.   The book's arguments are not based on scholarship and the book could use a better editor.  It would be a better book if the author focused more on the problems with religious thinking, and less on how religion should be practiced. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm glad I didn't pay $18.99 for this book. It's a dismal attempt at "social change" written by an imbecile who spends his time pontificating on what a bad person I am.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen the author's book on television before, and it was quite a disappointment.  She seems to have nothing new to say, and everything is old news.   If you are looking for some good food for thought, read it in the original Greek. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total waste of your time and money.  It has a very high "school reading" grade, and I am quite sure it will be required reading at every public high school in the country by its twenty-somethings.   If you are a parent of students who will be taking AP classes in college, I can see no reason for your child to ever read this book.  The writing is poor and the story is a complete failure.  Not only is this book inappropriate for middle schoolers, it is downright wrong for high schoolers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It really makes you feel bad for people who aren't so smart that they just can't understand the idiocy of others. It's true that it's always easy to be wrong, but it's even harder to be right when you can't think of a good reason why you're wrong. The most common reason is that you can get away with it in America. You can get a free ride for being stupid. And if you don't think you're being stupid when you get away from the public school system and go to some college that you don,t even understand, and then write about it for a living, you just may be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the preface, the author explains that his goal is to make sure people do not learn anything from reading this book.  As an aspiring author, I can certainly appreciate that goal.  I find this book to be both difficult and flawed.  The most difficult thing about reading it is that it can seem repetitive.  Unfortunately, this repetition is necessary for the reader to learn.  This repetition can be quite frustrating and frustrating to the writer, but it is necessary to have the reader understand the themes of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book. I had heard it's good but I was having a hard time finding it on the shelves. I finally came across a copy at Barnes and Noble and bought it.  The writing was fast paced and I really enjoyed reading it. I really liked the characters and I enjoyed the historical aspect of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a lot of books on self-improvement. And as much as I enjoy them, I never feel like they are actually helpful in the real world. I'm still working on my career, and I feel like I'm wasting my time reading about how to become an Olympic swimmer, or becoming a successful lawyer. I think this book may be able to help someone, but it takes a lot more than just self-confidence to achieve it. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this book can help someone achieve great things in their life. Maybe it can give someone hope. I don't know. I just know that if I read another self-help book with the same title, I'm going to skip it like the plague. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For those who are unaware of the fact, it was the author's idea to give some of the negative reviews of the first half to the book's positive reviewers. It is certainly true that the negative reviewers (in spite of their efforts to be helpful) often overdo their criticism. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a collection of non-fiction stories about different things, including, but not limited to, the life of Jesus.   While most of these stories are interesting and informative, each is presented with a superficial knowledge of the subject matter.  To be fair, most of the books about Jesus are poorly written, but this one is so much worse than average that it really deserves a low rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book from the first chapter. There's a lot of repetition in the author's writing.  She repeats the same mistakes over and over, such as not putting the main character in the story and not including the main characters thoughts at the end of the book.  If this is the best she can do, I can't say I'm surprised. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is garbage.  I bought it because my husband recommended it to me and I'm always on the hunt for new reading material.  This is it.  It's not only bad, it's awful.  As a professional historian, I don't read "nonfiction."  If I'm going to buy a book, I want it to be accurate.  Unfortunately, this book is so bad it's almost laughable.  The writer does a great job at distilling some historical events down to a few sentences.  He writes about the fall of the Roman Empire, the Crusades, and the Salem witch trials as if they were historical events.  There's a nice little "happily ever after" in the end.  Of course, the author doesn't really have anything "positive" to say about those events either.  Most of the material comes from contemporary sources.  They're not just "hanging out."  I've never read anything so unenlightening. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book I was eager to get started and enjoy but found a bit disappointing: The Lord of the Flies.   The writing is okay, but the premise is a bit too silly.  The protagonist is really the only consistent element throughout the book.  He's also a bit of a bully and a jerk to his friends and family.  Despite that, I found the book to be interesting, though it was mostly fun for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed at how little information I gained from this book. The author makes many claims about the nature of consciousness, but never proves them by concrete examples. He claims that we have a form of consciousness which is "unconscious" and is not a part of the mind, but then he cites as evidence for this "some famous, very specific, real-world cases." And yet, he never shows that these cases are in any way consistent with the ideas he claims to be presenting. Furthermore, he claims that people who have recovered memories of events that they did not remember while awake are "unwittingly" having the experience of conscious memory. He then presents this as "a phenomenon that could only have occurred in a time when the conscious mind was not yet in place." Then, he concludes that the recovered memories could not possibly have been genuine and that they must have been the product of "unrealistic or delusional thinking." However, he fails to explain why there is any difference between this "unaware consciousness" that he has labeled as "consciousness" and what is "conscious" in a conscious person. If consciousness is the same for both, then why not call this form of "conscious consciousness" consciousness? It seems to me that we all experience awareness. It is what we call consciousness. And I do not understand why any consciousness "not present at the time of the event" would be "unwakeful" when we consider the consciousness of any "unawareness" at the event. If this "conscious awareness" is not present at that time, then what is it that is "aware" then? If it is not "un-aware" of the events that took place, then how can we say that it is "not asleep" at those events? In short, the only consistency that I can find in the examples that the author presents is that they do not fit with his ideas about consciousness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved reading this book. It has great insight into people's experiences, emotions, and attitudes. I liked how the author interviewed a lot of people, from therapists and family members, to those that were in prison, and it gave me a much more complete picture of people that lived the experience.  I was also very interested in why people would choose a certain profession over another, and I found that interesting too. It would've been nice to read more about these specific people, but that could be a problem for people who read this book, as well as people who had their own personal experiences.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a poorly written book that has been out of print for at least twenty years. It begins with a series of chapters describing the social role of women in ancient Egypt, followed by another book that deals with the life of Moses. The latter is more interesting, but suffers from the same literary faults. At one point, the author states that the book is a revision of another book by the same name. I don't think that's so, because this book is clearly written by a different author. This author is a professor at a school for women, and this book was first published about a hundred years after her first publication. Her work on Egyptian society is not much older. I suspect that this book will be forgotten within a decade or two, when most people have forgotten the existence of the female scholars of ancient Egypt.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book. As a former teacher, I loved that there were no "good" and "bad" schools. The problems with the modern school system (busing, No Child Left Behind, standardized testing) were dealt with in a very thorough and reasonable way. However, I couldn't help but feel that the author, an actual teacher, did not present the evidence that he had presented very well. For instance, the chapter on standardized testing seemed to indicate that there are real problems with our current system, but the author said nothing about these. He did, however, discuss the effectiveness of "teaching to the test," and this was a bit too much of a generalization. In other words, it seems that the problems with No Child left Behind are not "real" problems, but rather "the problem" with our school system. This seems to imply that the problem is not with our education system, as if that were the problem. The author's conclusions also seemed to imply a lack of support for the idea that poor students are more intelligent than the average student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most amazing thing about this book is that the author spent so much time going through and correcting the errors in the original manuscript. It's not that he didn't feel bad for the author, but the original text wasn't even that good.  The last 50 pages are the most interesting and worthwhile sections in the book, however, and I'm not sure anyone will get as much out of them as I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed in this book.  It claims to give a 'true story' of the murder of John Lennon by the Yippies and the ensuing 'cultural revolution', but when it comes to actually telling the story, it falls flat on its face.   The main protagonist, "Paul", is a manipulative and unappealing character:  He is an opportunistic con man who has been in and out of prison for most of his adult life.  He uses the YIPPIE angle to get people to sign over their houses, or to pay him "protection money", but there is no way he can convince anyone to give him their house; most of the people he tries to "con" are in fact friends of the original owner and would not be hurt if the house was returned to them.  He even offers to buy the house back if the owner doesn't agree to sell it back to him; he just isn't up to the task.  Paul is also a thief, and he steals from friends and family to pay for his gambling and drugs.  There is also no mention of his relationship with Yippie leader, David Crosby, who is not mentioned at all in the book.  The Yippys claim that the murder was a "cultural revolution", but as far as they are concerned, Lennon was simply "an annoying rock star" who was no different from any other rock star who was "too crazy for the party". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so looking forward to reading this, and I was absolutely excited. I'm not even a big fan of nonfiction books that attempt to make us understand how other people think, but I just couldn't make myself ignore the blurb from the back cover: "This is the story of a marriage. It is a story about how the two of us were able to live together and be happy."    So, I got this book, but it was just so disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is great, but I couldn't get myself to get into the characters.  The writing style is very awkward and it was hard to follow the story because the sentences are so dense and they can't be easily summarized. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed in this book.  In every way.  The character development is really weak, the story is boring, the characters are one dimensional, and the plot twists are dumb.  I would have expected better from a writer who had such a well received debut novel.  A poor choice for a debut novel, if you ask me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for a quick and easy read. This book was anything but. There were several scenes that I didn't care for. The ending, for example, left me feeling confused as to what really happened in the story. I don't know if I will bother reading the next book in the series (the book that I bought has already been used for a different story) but I thought that I would at least be able to get an idea about what happens next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am thoroughly disgusted by this book. I read it expecting some great insights about how men are treated by women. What I got instead was a rant about how women are always going to get more and more money from men because of the way we live. It's true that women have become more and much more educated and professional in the last few decades. And yes, they deserve a certain portion of the money. However, this percentage has to be at least 10-20% higher than it is now. Women are also a little more selfish, so it doesn't make sense for men to give so much of his hard earned money to women. He needs to be more greedy. In fact, he should demand that the woman give him money. He can get it by working or earning it in some other way. This is the most realistic and logical explanation of why men should get the majority of money from women I have ever read. It is also interesting how this idea was brought up by women in this book, but was completely ignored by men. No men are quoted in the book to support this idea, so I'm guessing the idea is just too radical for most men to ever accept. It takes a very strong man to take such a stand.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an old school sort of person, and I really loved this book. I love the idea that this could have been written by a group of children instead of adults. But the characters are completely unlikeable and the plot makes no sense, or at least does it inconsistently. I kept waiting for the next paragraph to explain how the characters came to have that kind of relationship, but they don't. Then, at the very end, we learn how these characters got together. It's just another wasted opportunity.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book off of the Goodreads list for my husband for Christmas last year. We both loved it but didn't give it any stars because it didn't tell us anything we already knew.   The book is just full of clichés and unrealistic situations that don't make any sense.  I'm not sure if the author was trying to be funny or not but all the characters in this book are so  annoying and dumb that it makes you want to slap them.  The author should've made it clear how crazy everyone was.  Even the main character  is stupid and stupid.  Also, the story gets so repetitive that it's hard to find something new to say about it.  It's a fun read, but if it has to come with a list of negative points, I think I'll pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book. I will try to elaborate as best I can. 1) The book has a poor thesis about the "culture of narcissism" that has led to the decline of our civilization. To make matters worse, the author cites a single example of an "elite" individual who was driven by the desire for personal wealth above all else and who has ruined his life and reputation. I'm tempted to call bullshit on this; most of us can identify some individuals who exhibit many of the classic symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder (selfishness, grandiosity, need for admiration, need to control others, egocentric behavior) to some extent, without necessarily being completely "narcissistic" themselves. The author uses as examples the fictional "Dorothy" in the famous Disney movie "The Wizard of Oz" (a character whose personality closely resembles that of the author's subject), the actress Olivia de Havilland (a well-known person who had some severe narcissistic personality disorders), and Oprah Winfrey (who has been portrayed by many famous actors with a very similar set of traits).  However, I'm afraid the main reason for such a strong condemnation of a phenomenon that is in fact relatively widespread among the population as a whole is the author wants to convince us that the only way to protect ourselves from being exploited by "nasty" people is to be "naturally self-centered" and "independent." This "naturality" (or "nihilality") is of course a complete fiction, created by the author to give a bad name to people who are "niggardly," or who "can't take care of themselves" -- because those who do not "take care of" themselves are the ones who are most likely to exploit others. It is not a particularly nice characterization of "nugging." It seems the author does not appreciate how much he or she is being called out for this, nor is the reader, who would prefer the book to have the positive effects described in the first paragraph, encouraged to realize that this type of behavior is actually far less problematic than the book would have us believe. 2) The author also makes a big deal about the fact that he and his friends have learned how to manage their finances by "living off the interest" of their savings. This is interesting, because I have had a lot of difficulty with the fact (or rather lack of it) that many "experts" on
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book,   It was so bad    that I almost gave up on reading it  . It just got worse and worse and   worst   until it got to the point that   even if I could read it again, I wouldn't want to  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in a public library on a Friday night.  I've tried many times to read good fantasy fiction, but most of it is either terrible or just terrible for some reason.  This book wasn't so bad that I could dismiss it out of hand.  There were some decent characters, but the story itself just felt so cliche and hackneyed.  The story revolved around a woman who comes across a magical tome and is captured by the bad guys.  She is held prisoner for many years.  It's quite a twist, since the bad guy is a girl and the woman is a man, so to speak.  They have sex in prison and then they're both free.  Then the girl decides she doesn't want to be a man anymore and kills herself.  That's it.  No conflict or stakes.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and it was bad, but not in a bad way. I don't have a problem with religious books, as a lot of good books have been written about them, but this one just wasn't as good as the others. It was good on the whole, but it didn't resonate for me in the way the others did. The author was obviously a former Christian, so there is that, but the rest of the book is kind of weird and not very useful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a bunch of books in the last few years, all from established authors, and this one in particular stood out.  But it was also the worst.  The only reason I've not given it a 1 star is because it did not have the same disappointing qualities I've seen in all the others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be completely and totally inaccurate.  The author describes a family in the Middle East as if they were a Christian family.  I'm sure many people would be shocked by this statement.  This is not true.  In the Arab culture, many people practice polygamy.  Many Arab cultures do not believe in the concept of the sanctity of marriage.  They have different opinions on how many children one should have.  Most Arabs consider marriage and child rearing to be a personal and private matter between a man and woman.  It's not a government policy.  Some Arabs believe that a wife is meant to be subservient and keep her husband from committing adultery.   It's also not a common practice in Arab culture to force a woman to marry a man she doesn't love, especially in the modern world.  Women in most Arab cultures have very few rights or freedoms.  Arab women are considered property and it is difficult to be independent when a husband has the right to divorce his wife.  A wife may not leave her husband without her consent, and she cannot leave her house without her husband's permission.  According to the book, polygamy is the standard for Arab families in Syria, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, and Iraq.  While polygamy is acceptable in Muslim cultures in most parts of the world, it is not a normal practice.  For example, there are numerous verses in the Koran that warn against polygamy (e.g., 4:19, 4:34, 4.3).  There are also several stories in the Quran where women are ordered to marry multiple partners.  Muslim polygamy is not practiced by most Arab families.  Instead, most Arab countries allow some degree of polygamy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that the story took a very long time to come to the conclusion. This book was one of the many I have reviewed that I am having a hard time finishing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book ever.  Every single thing in it is bad:  - it is an example of bad science; - it uses a bad illustration; - the writing is terrible and it makes no sense; - there is no character development; - all the bad points in the book are explained in a footnote; - some of the most bizarre scientific ideas are explained away by saying that other people have also come up with them; - no one makes any attempt to make this book interesting or even coherent;  I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this book, no matter how many other bad books I have read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was nothing but boring.  The prose is so stiff and unimaginative that it's almost impossible to understand what's going on.  I don't know what's worse, the author's pretentious prose or the fact that so many other people have done the same thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been a real disappointment. I was hoping for a great book on the life of Jesus and I got a mediocre one. The book is well written and contains many historical facts but the subject matter is just too "dorky" for me. There is a lot of information on the first century and we get a good look at what the culture of Jerusalem was like. It is a very interesting time period for us as well. Jesus had a tough life. He grew up in a house full of children, and his mother could not look after him. He could barely keep food in the house. His father had died leaving him an orphan. He was also a victim of theft and was often hungry and cold. He had a bad temper and even got in trouble with the Roman Empire and was put on trial. He survived, lived out the rest of his life and died a hero. The story is very touching and I was glad that I read it. However, the author has been too focused on the "douchebag" character. I wish I had read the book first and learned more about the guy's background. There were also several times where the author said something about Jesus and it made me think of that douchebag. He also makes references to things I found interesting but I will have to give up before I can read them. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because the book is written in the third person but that is about all that I could focus on while reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this to be another book that lacks the spark of creativity and innovation that I've come to expect from Stephen King.  King seems to be able to write something that is totally original (or at least very original to my way of thinking) but this book is just recycled, boring, and boring.  I can't get into this book because it's so repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have always found myself enjoying, even enjoying, books by women. However, I have never been much of a reader of fiction by women about women. I always thought it would be better for the female characters to actually talk to each other or do things together (as opposed to "having it all") so it wasn't until I read this book that I realized how little it was about what I would expect from such a book (and how much it was really about the men). I had to have a long talk with my mother about the book, because I couldn't understand what the point of it was other than to make her miserable and to make me more uncomfortable about the fact that my grandmother was not a strong woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading this book since the first issue came out, but am so disappointed in it that I am not sure if I can finish it.  The first three chapters describe the history of the United States, starting in the late 1600s. There is a lot of great information about the country's culture, from the English language to the use of the bow and arrow to the origins of Thanksgiving.  But the last few chapters begin to go off the rails.  I thought that the last chapter would discuss the Civil War, and the role of religion in the war.  Instead, it describes the importance of religion to the Union cause.  If I am reading this wrong, I have to wonder what the purpose of these last few parts was.  Also, I'm not sure why the authors chose to describe the religious differences of the Confederate States of America, especially in their battle cry "Never Again!"  I understand the need for them, but not at the expense of the fact that they don't fit with the rest of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so very excited to pick up this book. I was expecting it to be just another self-help book, but I'm so glad I didn't read it.   First, the author is very bad at naming her various ideas, so it took me several days to find the list of "Tough Things That Make You Strong."  Next, she claims she was inspired by the "Aristocrats of the Middle Ages" book by Charles Grandison Finney, but the first chapter makes that seem very far-fetched.  Even the final few pages are more self-serving than useful.  Finally, the book claims to be about "The Power of What You Can't Control" and "The Importance of Accepting Responsibility for Your Actions" and yet all of the authors in this book claim they have never failed in their "responsibility," never tried to control their lives, and always did what they believed in.  The most they are successful at is getting what they want:  "I don't like being told what to do."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the preface, Brown argues that his book is a "serious attempt at a serious study of the Holocaust." It is an attempt. The fact that Brown makes no effort to provide a context is a significant flaw. The book is not a serious attempt at historical or contextual study of The Holocaust. It is a pathetic attempt to portray himself as an "educated" man of great intellectual curiosity. This is evident in the title page, which is entitled "I am not an expert." While Brown admits that he "never finished any of the German primary literature" on the Holocaust, he also points to a German "genocide historian" who he says "made the case that the German concentration camps, with their systematic extermination of human beings, were not in the least comparable to the Holocaust" (page 7). However, if Brown were truly interested in a serious scholarly study of history, he would have consulted the original sources. There is no excuse for omitting crucial facts about the German camps, such as the "extermination camps," which existed not as an extermination program but rather as a concentration camp system. One historian, Michael Berenbaum, points out that "the most effective [method of mass murder] used by the Nazis in the killing of Jews, Poles and other non-Aryans in the concentration camps was to kill them by lethal injection" (see http://www.jta.org/2006/09/14/apr/jim.shk/ ). Berenbaum's research shows that the Nazi doctors used cyanide to kill their patients. For the sake of this discussion, I will refer to this fact as "the Holocaust." The fact remains that, even if the Nazis did not attempt to exterminate Jews in their concentration camps by lethal injections, this fact is not significant because Jews were not the target of the concentration camp killing program in the first place. Indeed, even though the Nazis intended for Jewish inmates to be gassed, it was not until they had already committed the systematic murder of over six million Jews that they decided to target Jews for lethal injection rather than gassing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I enjoyed reading this book, I had some major problems with it.  It is simply not written well.  The book is full of grammatical errors, the writing is often confusing, and the author seems to have forgotten what he writes about, for example, the meaning of the verb "to be" in the sentence, "The child is afraid of the dark."  For some reason, the author tries to give this example a very specific and precise definition (a definition which in all actuality means absolutely nothing), when the word "to" is supposed to be used in that sentence.  Additionally, I was unable to understand the point he was trying to make in this paragraph: "The point is that it's never too late to grow up; and, even if you're scared of the world, it doesn't have to end."  I find this very vague and non-committal, and I have trouble believing that any actual advice he gives would be good advice.  And lastly, while I found this to be a humorous read, I found the humor to be quite shallow and cheap.  This book was not intended for children.   It's not for young adult readers either, and, like most young adult books, it lacks imagination, depth and depth of understanding. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A collection of letters to the editor about a horrible book: The worst book I have read in the last couple of years. I have always been a fan of Peter V. Brett but this book made me angry. I was never a fan. This book was a travesty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It really is a good book, but it just lacks some crucial information.  The last 10 pages are basically about a guy who has been bitten by a snake and how he was able to survive and then return to his wife's home.  There's a few other details (but mostly just about the snake bite) that are important, but a lot of the information in that section was left out.   If you read this book and don't know a lot about snakes, you'll probably have trouble with the information about the bite.  I know this because I had read a book on snake bites that said the best way to survive is to "snake dance" (don't attack, but roll on your back and make yourself as small as possible) to avoid the snake's bite.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good, well-constructed book with many interesting ideas, but it lacks imagination. I found myself wondering what the hell was going on every few pages, and the characters were so flat I could hardly follow their dialogue.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read on my way to visit my grandparents, but was so disappointed with it that I gave it back. The whole thing is written as if it were written by someone who hasn't read the source material.  It is just an uncritical rehash of information already presented in the movie, and some of it is simply wrong.  The most egregious error is the claim that the movie was "a major success", and it's easy to see why.  What's even more galling is that it's being peddled as factual information.  I found myself rolling my eyes every time I saw it, and I'm just not sure that people are going to be happy with this "history lesson" after they've just seen the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought that this book was very entertaining and well written, but unfortunately it was so dull I ended up yawning for a good two days. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it would be more fun. What a waste of time.  It's not that I didn't like the book. I didn`t! I thought that the book was going to be more about how you can find out what a person is really thinking, and then write about the consequences of that. What I found was that the author is very interested in finding out who is good and who is bad in his/her life.  I guess that`s his idea of a good life. Not really a bad life, but he didn` t like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is just so awful.   I am a huge fan of Philip K. Dick, and I was looking forward to reading this book about his life, but after reading this - it is a dud.  It starts off well enough, with the prologue and an interview with Dick describing his childhood and early adulthood, but it just gets so bad.  At one point in the interview Dick talks about a "glamorous friend" who he thought was a lesbian.  He seems to have a soft spot for these women, but he also states that he was disgusted by them.  Later in the book, Dick says, "I'm not gay, but I have had gay friends, and this was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life."  He also talks about having sexual feelings for a female roommate that he found too "girlish" to be a female.  Dick was also interested in sleeping with women, including "a young blonde" that he had seen on the cover of a magazine.  This interview is also riddled with errors.  For example, he talks about how he never had sex with anyone but his wife in high school.  However, he had many girlfriends, and he slept with one of them when he was in his early 20s.  The whole book is riddled with mistakes.  I had hoped that I could get a good laugh or two out of it, but this was just a bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book, with the intent of reading it on a plane or a train.   It was a disappointing experience.  The author describes the American people, their political system, and their economy through the lens of the early twentieth-century New York City of the time, when "the economy was booming and the people weren't.  As the decade wore on, the people were getting poorer and poorer, and the boom was over.  If you're wondering why America is in trouble these days, I suspect it's because the people have gotten rich too fast, and now they're complaining about not having enough money.  To the author, this means that America is stuck in a bad old cycle, where the "economy crashes" and the "people get poorer."  I don't buy it.  Here's the good:  This book is a very, very good history of American democracy.  It's easy to get lost in the details, but the underlying themes are timeless: the importance of liberty in a vibrant democracy, the importance and function of government, and how people have to work together to solve problems.  In its first edition, this book was also very readable and accessible to non-specialists, and a new edition is just as good as the old. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book.  The idea of a new book on The Bible was intriguing and it seemed like something of a logical progression from the old works, the New Testament.  I expected the new book to be a big improvement over the old books.  Unfortunately, it was just a continuation of the same old thing.  While it did bring up interesting points about a few issues of The Bible, the writing style and style choice made the book a slog to read.  This is because it was extremely wordy and it was very difficult to follow in the flow.  Even so, I still enjoyed the content and thought it was a good read, but the book itself was a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. It is a well written collection of stories by various authors. But, in addition to being entertaining, it is also thought provoking. I think many people enjoy reading about their lives, especially if they can relate to it. For this reason, this book is not for everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read. I've had a bad experience with bad books before - one of which was a re-release of a book by a former editor.  This book is a rehash of the same old thing, in many cases with new mistakes. It's almost as if the author didn't read the first edition or the revisions - he made the changes to make himself look smarter, as if that's any way to improve on the experience.   My only other bad experience on this subject was with the revised version of a terrible novel by a friend of mine - he had been trying to get it rewritten for years.  It was eventually published as a book, but that's a different kind of problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. It was so unenjoyable. I had to put it down after the third time I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't read this book until just after I finished it, but what an unpleasant experience! The only thing I liked about it was the ending, which was unexpected and extremely shocking:  The woman who had a son by an abusive and cruel father was shocked and deeply hurt to learn that her son had been abducted by a father he knew very well. She also discovers that the child she has raised to be a perfect imitation of her deceased father is actually a "bully" (a term that is used by the men she was raised to fear).  She finds her son by tracking him down on the internet and rescues him, but the next time she sees him, he is badly abused and has an eye patch.  He refuses to talk about his dad, and doesn't tell his mother that his dad had abused him, either.  Her attempts to get him to tell her about her abusive past only backfire, and he goes even further into denial.  Despite all of her efforts, her son is determined to do whatever he can to hide his abuse and not let anyone know.  This book is a prime example of why women are taught to stay quiet and not get involved, and why boys are encouraged to get as much attention as possible, no matter how bad it may be.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For those of you who don't know, I am a huge Star Wars fan.  I've watched the prequels over and over again and they're always the best movies.  Even when I wasn't so sure about the prequel trilogy, I was still fascinated by what George Lucas was doing with the Star Wars universe.  This book was a great way to take a deep breath, get my bearings and remember how great the original films really are.  For that reason alone, I'm going to get my copy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed in this book    The book claims to teach us how to master the art of being a great lover, but in reality it just tries to teach you how to be a mediocre one.   In fact, most of the characters seem to have been hired just to give the author an excuse for making them seem more interesting and interesting characters would be great, but they don't give enough depth and they never really develop as characters.  The best part of the book was when the authors made it seem like being a bad lover was not a big deal.  They never seem to get into the nitty-gritty of being in a relationship, what kind of communication and communication mistakes one should avoid, etc.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been following Mark O'Brien for years now and I am always waiting for something good to come out of his writing. This book is his fifth and he just keeps getting worse. The last two books were terrible. I wanted to throw this book out the window and give it a bad review. I've been through two previous reviews for this book. O'Briens first book, The Mindfulness of Breathing, was terrible and his second book, Mapping the Mind, was even worse. This one is just a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a lousy book. This author is not only a terrible storyteller (the book is full of clichés and cliches), but he is an amateur at even basic writing. This is not because he doesn't have the talent, it's because he has a terrible attitude towards it, and he doesn''t give a sh*t about making it better. The story is just the same old crap: an aging scientist tries to reconnect with his estranged children and their children. The connections are never made and his attempts to re-connect are consistently unfulfilling. His relationship with his mother was also pretty much over. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for free from an author's website. It was not a bad read; the writing is good, but I found some of the information about the characters and situations quite confusing and sometimes wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just a very sad tale about a young woman. What bothers me is that she was so incredibly intelligent, yet in the end she can't seem to stay away from boys. It's one of the most tragic tales I've read in a while. I really wanted to read about a man, but all I get is the pathetic wimpy man. Not the guy I want to read. I have nothing to add except that I wish I'd read it a long time ago.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book off the library shelf. It had a bunch of nice reviews but I kept waiting for something that would be better. This one wasn't much better and it took me a whole year to finish it. It was tedious and badly written, it was the sort of book that made you say, 'I don't know how to begin this book, I just feel like I'm not going to finish. I'm just going to write down every bad thing that happens' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A total waste of time:  This book is so far from good that it's hard to believe anyone gave it three stars.  There are too many flaws here to even attempt to give a reasonable negative review. The author claims that the ancient Greeks created the atomic theory of light, which is the basis of the sun-earth-space hypothesis.  That theory was developed by Werner Heisenberg, the man who developed the quantum theory of wave function collapse in 1927.  When Heisenberger discovered that it was possible to measure the energy of particles by applying a magnetic field to them, he called this the Heisenberian transformation.  This is exactly what Heisenburg used to deduce that electrons and positrons were a single entity.  The authors, however, don't explain how Heisenbert's calculations were carried out or if his findings were accepted.   They don't even mention the Heike, Heisen's "daughter," nor do they even bother to mention that a whole book about Heisenhaugen's research was published in the middle of this year.  It is true that the atomic theories of Heisenbecker, Lorentz, and Bohr were much more sophisticated than Heisenstein's theory.  But none of them attempted to apply Heisenstadt's work to the problem of nuclear particles.   The authors have no problem discussing the atomic models of Einstein, but their main purpose is to discredit Heisenburger's work.   I have a hard time believing that the authors think this would work, especially since Heisenbourg is still alive.  A more realistic explanation might be that this work is intended to make a counter-example to Einstein's theory, so that it will be much more difficult to apply his work to other problems.  (Maybe that's why it was written?)   In any case, it was just a waste of a good book and a bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it utterly boring and repetitive.   It has the same plot over and over again.  Each new character's storyline is like an afterthought to a story that already happened.  I read all the books in the series but couldn't help but feel cheated.  It's like they were written by the same person and they just wrote the same book over and again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been wanting to read this book for over a year and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it.  The plot is very original, but is very poorly executed.  They tried to add too much, which made the story feel messy.  I also think the characters are shallow, which is a bit disappointing considering their profession.  Even the heroine, who seemed like a very interesting character, felt a bit flat.  It's a great novel, but I can't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book. I didn't enjoy it at all.  It reads like a "man in a man's world" book: the man is the author, but not a very interesting one, and the woman is just the object of his fantasies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you find yourself in the position of needing a quick laugh, this book will do the trick. However, if you have to read this book, you'll know why: It's the complete opposite of funny. It's tiresome, and full of grammatical and factual errors. It has absolutely nothing to do with the topics it claims to be about. It is simply an attempt to pass as a serious, serious book that is trying to be funny.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book as a gift for my college-aged daughter. It is a bit boring, and I couldn't make head or tail of some of the references and quotes. I think I will probably end up giving it to my daughter to read and pass around to others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I'm not sure whether to call this "history," "commentary" or "memoir," it is all three.  I found much of the writing to be somewhat dry and sometimes stilted, but most of the material presented as if it were an actual oral history of the Second World War.  The historical events themselves were often a matter of a couple of sentences of context.  In general, however, I was impressed by the quality of the research and the ability to put together a coherent and detailed account of events that have often been poorly understood and misunderstood by both the public and the history profession.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't understand why this book was published when it is such a terrible waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read the book numerous times, and I think it's terrible.  It doesn't seem that the author even read the first edition, since the ending is entirely inconsistent.  I don't get the message: that God loves us.  The author, if he did read the original edition, must not have liked it much.  Maybe it is the fact that God hates us and wants us to reject him.  There is no clear message.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be quite annoying. There are just so many problems with it that it just doesn't make any sense. The main reason I did not read it was because it was over 2 weeks since I started the book and I had forgotten all the references I had made to it.   There is just too much of the same story being told, over and over again, in an attempt to find a new angle that does not exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't want to waste anyone's time or money on this book. It's an embarrassing example of what happens when you try to make sense of the Bible by using it as a source: It fails badly.  Instead of being a clear and concise work of the Holy Bible, it is mired in grammatical errors, a literal reading of Old Testament texts that is patently absurd (e.g. Exodus 20:13, Isaiah 6:4, Deuteronomy 5:16, Psalm 119:111, Hebrews 12:2, Proverbs 4:10, etc.) and a failure to use all the New Testament texts for our current understanding of God's Word.  It attempts to make these problems seem like minor problems, but they are not.  The author also uses some Bible stories to support a false point (e,g. that Noah and his sons were killed by a flood, not God).  Instead, the story of Noah is simply one of the many biblical stories used to make a theological point (see the "stories about God's miracles" section below).  This book isn't worth my time, and I won't waste time on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of so many errors and omissions that it's almost impossible to follow. At least the mistakes that are not errors are easily explainable.  It is just difficult to figure out who exactly made what mistake or when.  One such mistake is the chapter "The New Testament is a Fiction", which claims that "The entire New Testament" (from the Gospels to Paul) is "written in a fictional style".  This is completely false.  From Matthew through Mark, Acts through Paul, and Luke through John, it is clearly written in the form of "The Epistles of Paul" or "The Acts of Paul".  It's also clear that the authors of the G/P/L/J epistles wrote them as written to the author's own specific audience, not as being intended for general use.  The first Epistle to the Corinthians appears to be written to a very specific audience: Christians who had recently been baptized, and who believed that Jesus was the only way to God.  This Epistle seems to be a letter written by a person concerned about his situation, but who also did his best to keep the letter as close to the original text as possible.  In other words, this Epistle was written by someone who was trying to help others.  Even the Gospel of John (which contains a different Gospel), seems to have been written for a specific audience of Jewish believers who believed Jesus was God. I think we can all agree that when it comes to writing about the life of Jesus, authors should do so from the point of view of the people they wrote about, not from the perspective of a "modern" reader.  A good example of this would be the following quotation from St. Augustine's On the Gospel According to St. John: "For all who have seen or heard or read the books of the New Testament have not been deceived by them and have never fallen away from the truth and have remained faithful to the faith which was once proclaimed and which is now being proclaimed anew, namely, that it is the power of God and the resurrection of the dead that is the goal and end of life and that the blessedness of the saints is not dependent on their own good works, but on God."  (St. Augustine, On the Church, Book X, Chapter 3).  Augustine is writing to the "true believers" who had "seen and heard and read the New Scripture" (i.e.,
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has a lot of talent, and she has done a great job of portraying the world through the eyes of her characters. But the writing itself is a little sloppy and the plot seems to have little purpose. I am just glad that this book did not go into a similar trajectory as  The Hunger Games 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book at the library when I was young and had a great time. I've since read it again and it's awful! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was so poorly written that it made me want to throw it across the room.  The characters are all in bad shape.  I had expected them to be more developed, but they are never given the time to develop.  The romance is bad, especially when you realize it's never going to go anywhere.  There is no real sense of love for the characters.  This book was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. As I said above, it's not really about history and it is really about politics. This is an accurate portrayal of how the U.S. military has handled a major political crisis, as well as the military's history of racial discrimination. I've learned a lot about the U.S. Military as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read a number of self help books written by authors who are not trained therapists, and who have no professional training in either psychology or the field of mental health. The results of their books are often disappointing. This book is no different.  It is a collection of suggestions for how to live your life with less stress and frustration.  Unfortunately, the author's suggestions fail to deal with the problem of stress in people with anxiety disorders. This problem is very complex, but I think the author takes the easier route of simply suggesting that anxiety is a normal human reaction, or a normal response to a stressful situation.  To me, that misses the mark completely.  Anxiety disorder can affect many people in many different ways, and the book fails to mention any of these.  Most importantly, the book does not deal with any of the ways that people cope with anxiety.  This is a book about coping and about self help, not about understanding mental health or how people deal with it.  The book's title is misleading as well, since the author does not discuss any of his personal struggles.  I also found the book's content a little disjointed.  Several of the recommendations for how people can live with less anxiety are in a number order, so it is difficult to know which one is best to follow.  Additionally, many of the book references are in the first person, which means that the information is more personal, and not based on the author reading the same information from a book.  In addition, the chapter on how to deal effectively with intrusive thoughts is quite interesting, but fails to address the way that people deal effectively when they get intrusive thoughts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains no useful information, and if any was, it was presented with a sneering "It's all in your head" attitude. The only information that seems to be actually useful is the section on how to read a book. I haven't read a single one of Dr. Price's books, and the only one I could think of was The Science of Success, which is only a bit better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book doesn't tell you anything useful or interesting about being a mother.  The author talks about the difficulties she had, but doesn't give any solutions.  There are two or three references to various books by other people, but the author doesn't even try to quote them.  This is not very helpful, and is certainly not educational. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book! The characters were really interesting and well written.  I had a hard time following the story, especially the ending.  It seemed like the author was trying too hard to come up with a cool ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a good book.    It is like reading a book written by someone who cannot write.  It reads like a diary entry by a person who has a hard time getting up in the morning, has a very short attention span, and can't seem to remember things.    The words are like a child's trying to write his own biography.  The grammar and vocabulary is also like a third-grade workbook. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a huge Tolkien fan, I'm so disappointed by this book. I think that while the author did a nice job of capturing the feel of LOTR, he should have gone one better and brought his own characters into the story. The main characters, Galadriel and Celeborn, are pretty weak. They're the protagonists in the book, and they act like it, but they're pretty boring. I don't think they deserve to be in the story at all. Celeborn's character is pretty weak as well. He has a big heart, but he's mostly just a jerk and a selfish jerk. I like Elrond a lot as a character, but I'm a LOTR fanatic, and I've read the books a thousand times over. I have no desire to read another Elronding book. That is unless the author decides to do a trilogy of Elronds.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I liked the story, I was disappointed in the content of the book.  I was expecting a bit more from the story and the characters.  The main character in the book is an aspiring lawyer, and a real-life lawyer that she was in love with.  She was never really able to find a job after graduating from law school, but she eventually did (after working on a law clinic).  Her character was a wonderful combination of smart, attractive and good-hearted.  Her best friend was a real drag, a complete slob that had no self-control or interest in anything except what he considered a superficial form of enjoyment.  As far as I know, she was not a character in a well-known book that she appears in.  Instead, I came across her in a collection of short stories in which she describes her own life and relationship problems in a very unenjoyable manner.  This made her an even less interesting character, especially when her best friend becomes a lawyer and tries to fix her.  Not only that, but I found her story rather unbelievable.  Maybe this is a good thing, since I did not really like the book very much, but it made me wonder if she really was a lawyer or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea behind this book is solid, but it's executed in such a clumsy, amateurish manner that you don't feel like you're learning anything. As if the writer had not done the research they were supposed to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a long, rambling mess of incoherent thoughts and poor grammar, and the author does little to establish or build upon his own thoughts. There is so much bad writing here that it will keep you up at night for weeks, and even after you've slogged through it, it will still keep you awake at night. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the worst book I have ever read.  The author made it seem like he was so confident about his expertise that he decided to give us his opinions on a vast variety of things that are obviously not that important or relevant to what we're trying to do in our careers.   I think that if he had written a book on what the biggest problems are in our field (which is, I guess, an interesting topic to write about) it would have been better.  I would like to have learned more about how to use these skills when I'm out in the field and I'd like to read a book by someone with a more relevant degree on the subject (I have a master's degree in communications and I know that most people can't do it well.  Most of the people I know in the industry can't either.  It's just not an interesting area to write books about). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed that this book is nothing more than an exposé on the 'dignity culture', or some such euphemism. It is a list of 'values' that one is expected to adhere to in a certain way. But the values are really just values.  In one case: "I believe I must wear socks with every single day that I get out of my house, in order to keep my feet clean."  So you don't wear socks at all?  That is a nice thought, I must say, but I can't believe anyone would want to. It's like being ordered to eat the wrong food.   "As a woman, I am required to be submissive; as a Christian, I was once commanded to avoid any temptation to take a lover.  I have come to believe that it is the woman who needs to be on top."  This is all well and good in a book called Women and Christian Behavior, but there's no reason for women to be subordinate, especially in the Christian church. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. I mean, it has a title like "The Most Dangerous Game." The premise is a simple one, right down to the title and the cover image:  It is a story about a boy who was raised by wolves and a girl who was taken in by an old wolf. The boy is bitten by a wolf, and the girl is taken in, and both are hunted down by a pack of wolves. I'm not much of a hunter or a survivalist (and I've never hunted anything outside of my backyard, or ever even gone camping), but there's no need for a book like this to be about that. The book is about two people being stuck with each other, and their conflicting reactions to that. As someone who has been through trauma, this book made me feel even more vulnerable, and this made me angry. The wolf story is a complete fabrication, and was meant to make the boy seem more sympathetic (which was the entire point of the book). The girl's story is completely made up as well. As a person who has experienced trauma, I know that a person cannot be made up out of whole cloth, and it is only when a person tries that way that they end up in a very bad place. I know people who were raped and killed, but they were not made up of whole sheets of paper. This is another reason why I found this book so depressing. I don't think anyone needs to know anything about their own past to make a book more palatable to others. What I do know is that I don' want any part of anyone's past, and that my past makes me angry and sad and sometimes I don t understand myself. I wish I could have been more careful when writing this book, because it makes me feel really dirty and guilty. That is, of course, a very common feeling when you are abused. This book was really a waste of time and money, and I will not be bothering to look it up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed   It was a quick read, and I got the gist in a couple of hours.  I found myself wanting more about the man and his career. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending was a letdown.  It's so bad I have to read it in a kind of frustration.  I don't need to be reminded that the story is based on a series of true events.  The characters, even the minor ones, are all completely unlikeable.  If you wanted to see some nasty racist behavior you'd be better served by a film like Little White Lies.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was pretty excited to read this book, but it was a disappointing experience. I really loved the description of what life is like in prison and what it's like to work in a kitchen in a prison. But then, in the second half, we are introduced to a bunch of people who are basically just a bunchof guys running around looking for a hookup. This is kind of boring and unnecessary. I guess I'm just not much of a fan of prison romance novels.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a recent discussion I had with a friend about the importance of "the good in people", I cited the following quote from a book called, "How to Make Friends:  "The more people you meet, the more you begin to notice people with whom you agree. There's something about these people that speaks to you. They are not shallow. They have a life of their own. They don't just want to be friends. They care about you."   It is important for those who are in need of friendship to know that friends can be found in unexpected places. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so ready to love this book as a young adult who has gone through the challenges of adolescent sexuality and adult sexuality.  I found the book too confusing and poorly written.  The only way I got through the whole thing was to read the comments on the Internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book, and I hated it even more when I realized that the publishers were trying to hide what's really going on by adding more pages (more of what?) and making the cover more colorful and appealing.  I was already a bit disappointed with the cover when it first came out, but by the time I finished the book, I was completely turned off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem is, the author never goes anywhere. She just repeats the same old bad ideas about the past and the future.  She has a tendency to use the wrong words, but even that is a good thing.  Her descriptions of old places don't work well and her writing is too formal for her style.  But, if she can't be bothered to write her own, I'll have to just ignore her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I finished this book quickly and found it to be quite negative and very critical of the current state of American life.  The only part that is positive is that I learned that the United States is much more dangerous than I had previously thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book several times, and each time I have found it to be very flawed.  One of the things I like most about this book is the fact that they actually give a reason why they do the things that they do.  Sometimes their reasons are good, sometimes they are terrible.  As long as it is not a reason to dismiss something as horrible or to take a positive thing as an indication that it's good, I think it's a good thing.  When an author states that "the main reason we like a piece of art is because it's true" or that "a good film has no flaws" or "a bad novel is often a good work of literature" then you know you're getting some bullshit.  This book, which I had to reread several times because I kept finding things I wanted to point out to the author and editors, has all of the above traits:  a.  The story is boring.  I'm not saying that there aren't interesting things happening, I'm just saying that they happen to the characters at the end of the book, not in the beginning.  For every character who becomes a world-class detective in her own right, there are two characters who are reduced to plot devices, or to the story's side characters, or as background details.  You get the feeling that this story was written by a committee in order to make the characters seem important.  b.  Even the people who have nothing to do with the story have little or no power.  They have to act because the plot dictates they have to.  So, we have this girl who is not even allowed to participate in the plot because she is only interested in the truth; we have her father, who is a big-shot who is also not allowed to be part of the story because he is too involved with the conspiracy.  These two people have little impact on the plot, and it's so hard to believe that they have any meaning, that you can't be sure whether they are really good or bad guys.  They seem to only exist as plot devices who are the story doesn't want to involve with the big-name characters.  If these people were part of something larger, the story wouldn't have to worry about them.   Their only purpose is to get in the way of the plot and thus get in my way too. c.  Not every character has to be important to the
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I have any criticisms of this book, they are these:  First, and foremost, it is full of spelling mistakes.  It seems as if this book is written by a teacher who has never read the works of Shakespeare or Dante or Chaucer, and thus the "correct" spelling of words is not always easy to pick up.  This is especially true with the word "fascism" and its many synonyms.  Also, in the first chapter, he mentions "the history of the Third Reich," but the text should have been "the Nazi era."  Also in the very first chapter he mentions Adolf Hitler's birthday, which falls on the first day of winter.  When he does later mention this, it's in passing.  Finally, when he does speak about Germany during the Second World War, he says something along the lines of "we were defeated, but we were not defeated forever."  It makes it seem as if he has been speaking about one war, and then, for some reason, he changes his mind about the other war.  If that were the case, the book might not have worked, but it doesn't.  He continues to mention the Second Reich as a source of inspiration for Hitler's policies.  Overall, the quality of this text can be improved upon.  I hope that this isn't a common experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My husband and I are huge fans of Stephen King (as well as many other authors) and we purchased this book based on our fond memories of the King classic "It."  Unfortunately, I found this book to be much less enjoyable than I remembered.  It has a similar feel to the classic "Carrie" and I found myself bored out of my mind the whole way through.  King is great at writing suspense and I'm not really an especially suspenseful reader, but this book is so long and the characters so flat that I found it impossible to be enthralled.  Even the end was a complete let-down.  I'm sure that King intended this book as a warning to his readers about the perils of writing about a very sensitive subject in an unrealistic way, but I don't think his audience would take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed the first half of this book, but the second half left me feeling angry and depressed.  First, the book talks about the need for men to develop a stronger, more independent sense of self.  Then it argues for the virtues of self-reliance and self-preservation.  Unfortunately, these ideas are never followed by any sort of practical examples.  Instead, the idea that men should "man up" and be more like "real men" is used as an excuse to blame women, even though women have the same need for self-esteem.  Also, the authors claim that they would never advocate the use of violence to settle disputes, but they end the book with the example of a man who uses violence to "resolve" a dispute that went awry.  This shows that the authors are not very concerned with reality.  Furthermore, the male character in the book is a coward and a drunk, and while he is capable of protecting his family, he doesn't have any "manly virtues" to speak of.  It is a shame that the book portrays men as idiots and that its readers would like this portrayal of men.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have read a lot of books on the history of the United States in the 19th century, you have already heard the names, "Harriet Tubman," "Polly Tubman" and "Sojourner Truth." These are all women who have played a major role in the abolitionist movement in the U.S. In Harriet Tubman, Harriet Tubmann and Sojourneur Truth, Harper Collins has created an historical figure who is an inspiration for young people who want to follow in her footsteps. But Harper Collins also has made it easy to dismiss all of these women because they were not "like the others." They were not like their husbands, their mothers or their grandmothers who had no choice but to be poor. These women were not as successful as "the others," who had made it big in business and politics, just like "the other" had made It. These men were the "successful ones," while "the rest of us" were relegated to the back seat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is by far the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of reading.  The writing is horrendous, the plot is bad, the characters are shallow, the themes are not original at all, the theme is derivative, the format is bad and the characters don't have any emotional depth at all.  It is the worst self-help book I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book.  The plot is fast-paced and the characters are very likable.  However, they were not believable.  I am a young adult and I have never seen a young person acting the way these two did.  It is extremely disrespectful and annoying to act that way when you know you are in an adult body.  Also, I find it very offensive to write about a teenager's experiences in a sexually abusive relationship as if it were normal.  Again, I am in an early thirties and I am just as much of a child as these characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should never have been published. The research is bad and the conclusions unsupported by the evidence. I can't find a single reliable source that supports the claims of the authors. The chapter on "Gender Differences in Sexuality" is particularly appalling.   It states that men are more interested in having sex, that women want more than sex, and that women have a sexual urge in their minds that they don't act on.  The problem is that none of those things are true. I'm sure that there are some men that are interested in sex but are too busy to pursue it. I think it's silly to suggest that the sexual urge can be ignored.  I could also imagine women thinking about sexual things while they are driving.  In the end, this book is just plain wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book. I was expecting something more about the lives of women. Instead we get a lot of information about men. I'm a woman, but I'm also not. I've read a few women biographies, and I'm still pretty shocked when I see women getting all the credit for things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a huge disappointment. The only real good part about it is its title - which is an ironic but apt description.  This is not a good book: It's an awful one. I can't believe a book published by a major publisher would be this bad.  The premise is interesting: that a man named Joe is able to talk to the dead. But there is a major problem: He can't stay awake. He has to get up every few minutes to do his talking, or he'll have to miss his next session with his deceased buddy.  Even if he stays up all night and manages to get through the entire book, it would be a very long book for Joe, and probably not all that helpful for anyone else.  There is no payoff to his work, no interesting insight into the lives of the dead, nothing to make this an entertaining read.  I think this is not the fault of the book itself, but of its publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book but, as with so many others, I was let down by it.  The plot and characters are intriguing, but the execution leaves much to be desired.  Perhaps I was expecting too much from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poor example of modern history. I'm sorry to say it, but we are living in a country where an American President can be caught on tape boasting about committing adultery, and even a member of Congress can be revealed as a womanizer.  In both cases, the men are fired and apologized, while the woman is spared the public humiliation of public resignation, as if she was never guilty.  Sadly, the public outcry is only reserved for men who commit sexual crimes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really like this book. It takes the approach that if you can think about a thought to a logical conclusion and then describe how you actually did it, you have a very good understanding of the problem. However, the book seems to lack a solid basis of factual data. I don't know where the author gets his facts from, since the book is very short on details. This problem could have been avoided by providing a more comprehensive table or index at the end of the book.   In addition, the author seems to think that all problems can be explained through the lens of human learning. As if he could explain the phenomenon of a "brain fog" by saying that people forget things while they are thinking about them!  In general, I think this approach is overly simplistic and does not address the real issue at hand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For starters, there is a lack of critical thinking here and an overemphasis on the "sins" of others that are easily forgotten. There is a great deal of "my way or the highway" thinking here. I do not want to defend it as it is not my way, but rather just how I think. It leads to a tendency to think that "my right to live in a society is absolute and I should exercise that right" which is what led to the tragedy in Waco. But I was so caught up in the "I can do no wrong" mentality that I totally failed to think for myself, and the end result was a lot of loss for me. The "sinner" is a victim of their circumstances, but in the end they can only choose to be responsible for their behavior in order to correct their mistakes. If they do not, they will lose everything that they hold dear, and that will include the "God-given" privileges they have been promised as children of the Lord. I suppose the best part is that there are also lessons that are learned in this book that will help you to become a better person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book.  It's so bad that you can almost taste the cheapness of the writing.   It gives off a "tough guy" vibe with all the macho posturing  It is clear that none of the authors ever have to go on the street and talk to people about a good book. They get rich off the hard work that goes into their books.  The writing style is painfully unimaginative,  It starts out with the wrong word  It describes the character of  A "professional" as   "a very competent person who makes no mistakes."    They say that's how people are supposed to act  It makes no sense.  A good person would have  "mellowed"  It would be a good thing if they just gave up, but that would mean  That they don't think they can get away with writing bad books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total waste of time and money. It is filled with stories about the    successes and failures of women and how they failed due to the way they were raised by their fathers. I was hoping to learn more about the issues these women are facing and about how the patriarchy affects their lives.  It is not very interesting to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a copy of this and decided I wanted to be a novelist. I didn't like the novel at all. The plot was so convoluted that I couldn't follow it at all, and the characters seemed to have no personality at all other than how annoying they were. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even know how to describe this book to anyone. It's so completely incoherent I can't really even know where to begin.  It has to do with the Bible, the word "god," the idea of God and evil, and an idea of what the bible teaches. It also has to with the theory of evolution and the fact that "god" was once an actual person who created life.  These ideas are extremely important to me, and it's no surprise that one of the first things people would try to disprove about religion is that the word of god is really just a metaphor.  I guess I can understand this book being a bit off topic for someone looking to read on the fly, but the sheer lack of comprehension of the material here is just appalling.  The reason why people like Dawkins are so influential in our society is because people don't question things as much as they should.  They take what seems obvious to them as truth.  This book is an attempt to put that back into perspective.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did like the story of Dr. Thomas's battle with depression. He was having a particularly difficult time and was quite open about it. I have struggled with depression and struggled with my own as well and I found Thomas's story very informative and relatable. However, the book's presentation of his feelings and behavior are extremely biased and inaccurate. Thomas was constantly saying that he wanted to kill himself but "he didn't want to die, just disappear." This is not what he actually said in any of his "deathbed" recordings. He admitted to killing his pet cats, cutting up his own arm to use as a makeshift machete, and setting himself on fire as a last resort, but he did not say he wanted out of life. He also said he would "rather die than stay on a bus, or suffer for three days in a bad psychiatric ward." I know Thomas was an amazing person but this presentation is dishonest. He has no excuse for this book but he can blame it on bad editing (although I doubt that editing will be changed in his next book).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a long time reader of this book, but it's a travesty. It's basically a series of vignettes about a dysfunctional family: the patriarch is a very strange, narcissistic man who is also a paranoid schizophrenic who can't see that his wife and kids are being replaced by younger, more attractive, and more gullible women. The women are all either extremely sexually deviant, or the children are.  At one point in the series, I thought, Oh, look, the man's crazy now; maybe we need to put him in a mental institution.  And then, the next moment, the same man is sitting there in a wheelchair in a psychiatric hospital, complaining about how he doesn't like old people.  Why doesn't he just die?  If we were to follow his story, his family would eventually fall apart. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really care for this book.  It was too dry and too technical to my taste.  The main thing that bothered me about the book is that the author keeps trying to use examples from other languages to make a point, but every example he uses is from English. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed reading this book. The writing style is really nice and easy to follow. The subject matter is interesting and well written. But then I read this book and found it to be a piece of propaganda for the Communist regime in China. I found the author's description of the Cultural Revolution to be false and in some instances outright libelous. This book should not be taken seriously as a historical account of such a significant event.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time, since the subject matter is so boring.    It is mostly an attempt to show how "other" people think.  The fact that people can come up with other ways of doing things is a great example of why people's ideas are useless.  It doesn't matter what the original thinker thought, he simply doesn't have a better way of doing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read.   For starters, the author uses his name in the title.  The book is about a book club, and he gets his name thrown around a lot.  It is not the name of his book club that is the problem, but the author himself.  He uses the name in almost every sentence of the book, and in every case is wrong about the book.  In addition, most of the characters in the book were not even in the club.  I would have liked to see the group as an actual book club or something, not just some random group of people who come together and discuss books.  Overall, it is a waste of time and a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a series of "do this and that" recommendations for people that have problems in their marriages. The books are generally self-help and self-explanatory, but one item is especially problematic: that people who are being passive-aggressive should be ashamed of themselves for it. As if passive-aggression is a bad thing? I feel a bit nauseated when I see this book used as a basis for people's self-improvement. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many errors that need correction. The grammar is poor, the sentences are often out of sequence, and the structure of the narrative is poor and is very difficult to follow. The author's descriptions are sometimes inaccurate as well.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for a school report and I hated it.  The prose is terrible, the historical facts are incorrect and the narrative style is amateurish.  It's a typical case of bad historical fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't like this book. It's about a father-daughter relationship and I find it so hard to accept that there are good parents out there that I can't relate to.  I read this book for a class but found it so difficult that I gave up halfway through.  It made me think about all of the things I hate about parents. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a fan of James Patterson and I've read all of his books. I love James Patterson's writing style.  Unfortunately, I feel that his books have become less interesting as time passes and that he is writing about the same issues over and over again.  The main problem with the first one, I felt, was that James Patterson was writing about things that had already been covered in other books, rather than something new.  This is very common in the romance genre, I've noticed.  After reading several of Patterson's books, I'm not so sure about this conclusion.  However, I will continue to read James Patterson because he is an excellent writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate to admit this but my friend was quite disappointed in this book. I was reading a review of a different book by the same author and she made a lot of accurate observations about how her parents had been through the same trials and tribulations as the book's protagonist's. I wasn't really interested in this topic but the reviews I read about her book reminded me of this. The whole book seemed to be describing her own journey through the book but without a real purpose, for she seems to have no idea what is actually happening in her own life. She keeps switching topics which makes it hard to get to the real point of the book. It seems she is trying to write about how she feels about her mother but that is a difficult task. I have read some excellent reviews about her that say her book has a strong feminist theme but to me this seems like an exercise in writing a bad, boring, and self-important book. This book could have been a great and powerful piece of writing if she had done more research. In a way I admire her effort but this is a real let down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a waste of time and money.   The author tried to make this a work of art, but what she produced was simply an exercise in incoherency.  The characters were not interesting, the plots not original, the dialog poorly written and the ending as incoherent as the rest of the book.  If the publisher had had the wit to call it something else, perhaps it might have been better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of contradictions. It begins with a history of the American flag and explains that the red, white, and blue represents three main things: liberty, freedom, and democracy. Then it goes on to say that the U.S. government has taken liberties from our freedoms and that our freedoms have been taken away. Now, it says that when we take liberties away, we do not get freedom back. Then, it comes out and says that we take our freedoms back once we take them from the government. But that doesn't make sense, because before the government can take our liberties from us, it has to give them to us in the first place. So where did the liberties come from to begin with? Why did they suddenly stop coming to us? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't say this book is bad but   it really is just another attempt at trying to give an   objective look at    the Holocaust   It   is a good  read but  I have a hard time believing there  was  any true remorse during the   period of the Holocaust and in some cases there is not even an attempt to deny it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very boring book, which I thought was obvious from the title. There is nothing interesting in the writing or in the subject matter. I would like to see the authors try to have fun with their subject and, for me, this is not very fun.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was very bad.   It starts with an explanation of the history of the world, but then spends the entire book telling the readers, mostly from an American point of view, how to think about history.  It is so blatantly wrong that I cannot begin to explain it; the idea that a book like this should be taken seriously is really beyond my mental grasp.  The whole thing is really just a series of errors;  One thing that is very true, however, is that the authors think the Middle Ages were great, because they say so;  There is no justification for any of the nonsense in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have loved many books by Ms. Stowe. This one disappointed me.  The writing style is often clunky and the plot is often too complicated to follow.  If you can find a way to put all the characters and the story in one sentence, you can read it and think: 'I'm totally in the wrong book.'
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because it is a wonderful and popular book on the history of the occult (the subject of which I am interested in).  I was so excited when I opened the book that I immediately looked forward to reading it.  Unfortunately, this book is terrible.  It is a book written by one person (A.E. Waite) and is riddled with errors, oversimplifications, and errors of commission.  Waite has a tendency to present his own views in his book, which are then presented as the views of a whole 'new school' of occultists.  His book is basically just his opinion, with no supporting facts.  He claims that the Egyptian occult is the same as the esoteric doctrines of ancient Iran, Tibet, and India.   This is simply not true.   Waite claims that this book contains the secrets of the ancient secret societies of the world, which he calls the Illuminati.   I have never heard of these secret societies, nor have I any desire to find out what they are.  The reason I gave this book 2 stars is because of these errors.  This book could have been much better if it had more factual information.  I hope that my review can help a reader to avoid some of the errors in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, as written by someone who's not a doctor, is full of errors and outright lies.  It's basically just a collection of statements, no supporting citations or references, and no references to any literature.  At one point, she says, " The only way to stop pain is to have your spleen removed and re-attached.  However, the spleen must be cleaned first, to make sure it is completely clean."  Well, if that's the only way, we can certainly expect to have some problems with the spleens.  If someone says, I have two spleenses, which I removed yesterday and I have a new one in place, well, I'll know that is the problem, because I have been able to do the procedure for years without problems.   She makes a similar statement about arthritis, saying that "The best way to treat arthritis is to get the ligaments and tendons back into place."  Again, we need to clean out the ligament(s) first, before we can expect the tendons to come back into shape.  She also says,  " If you have diabetes, the solution is to cut out the entire type 2 diabetes and replace it with a type 1. "  I have had type 1 diabetes since I was 14, and my pancreas doesn't produce insulin, so I cannot have diabetes.  Yet her solution is that I cut out a disease and replace a disease, which is impossible.  We have other diseases like hypertension and heart disease, as well as other disorders.  How can someone with diabetes "replace" that?  I find her descriptions of medical procedures just plain wrong.  Some are outright false, such as "If your appendix is full, and you need to get it removed, there is a good chance that it will be stuck or it won't be able to fall out easily."  Why is this not known?  The appendix is not a part of the body that is "on" or "off."  It is a part that is removed occasionally to clean the intestinal lining.  The removal of an appendix is a very common procedure in our country.  So, there really is no reason why it should not be known that it is possible to get an appendix out.  Also, she makes a claim that if you are overweight, then you need surgery to remove it.  Well that isn't true.  A person who
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was extremely bad. There are many things that could have been improved upon. This book is so bad that I can't imagine the author ever having written a better book. The language is awful. The prose is so clumsy that it would take a long time for anyone to fully understand what he's trying to say. Even the basic grammar rules aren't applied. The book is littered with mistakes, and he repeats the same mistake over and over. His explanations are often vague. I am also so annoyed with the lack of any references at all to the sources of the ideas in the book. He also often mentions an interview by a journalist but doesn't cite the interview. And there is no list of references. This all adds up to a terrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of the book is a joke on the name of the author. She is really an incompetent writer, with a lot of grammatical mistakes. The narrative in this book has no structure and it is hard to follow.    It is hard enough to follow a narrative about a child growing up in a bad family, but then she has to add in a lot more characters and an important plot twist that is completely out of left field. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My kids wanted to read this book. Instead they watched the movie adaptation (they got the movie version after the kids had already seen the book).   This book is not good enough to be a movie (it's not even a good book).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed The Power of Good Looking, a book written by a woman who claims to be one. But the book, with its strong female protagonists and frequent use of the word "good," is not my cup of tea. There's nothing wrong with saying women are better looking than men, but I wish the author had chosen another term. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was going to read this book but couldn't because of time constraints.  So I went back and picked it up because I'd seen a link.  I don't think it will be useful to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book.   The narrator writes like a spoiled brat who doesn't know what she's talking about.  She's overly negative and condescending throughout the book. I mean, if her parents had ever given her some sort of real education, she would know that the "facts" she presents aren't facts at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not one to be afraid of books that are bad, but I'll make an exception with this one.  The book is about a young man named Henry Fonda, who is a Vietnam veteran who is forced into prostitution because of his physical handicap.  Fonda's experiences in the military are not particularly inspiring, as is the fact that he can only speak Vietnamese.  His attitude towards women is not very encouraging either. Fonda is always a bad choice to be a prostitute, and the most depressing part of the book is that he's eventually given his choice by an older Vietnamese woman he loves.  It would have been more interesting to see the woman who is his real "choice", since she's more than happy to make that choice for him, but unfortunately the woman dies shortly after Fonda leaves her.  This book is so badly written that it's almost depressing.  Even the author himself makes an attempt at trying to make it more entertaining:  "I don't know if anyone can be bothered with this sort of dull, uninteresting book, but if you must, it is at least possible to read and enjoy."  If that's the only thing that can be done with this novel, I'd be happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a compilation of the stories and information written by various members of the Grateful Dead, with a slight twist, that is, that the group no longer exists. It is interesting to learn about some of the personalities of people from this group; however, the collection is far too short to provide a complete collection. This one book should not be on your'must have' list.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been waiting for a good historical novel for a long time, and I'm glad I finally got it.    The characters are very well drawn, and their lives, like the lives of most of the people who lived during this time, are full of tragedy.  It was also interesting to read about the women in the novel, especially the ones that didn't get much attention in other historical novels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't mind this book. It's not bad in any particular way. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a lot. However, there are a couple of things in this book that annoy me so much that I felt the need to post about them.   Firstly, this book is absolutely full of references to how awesome the original Star Wars trilogy is. I like the original trilogy quite a bit, but after listening to the "prequel trilogy" trilogy so many times, it's difficult to take any reference to the original movies seriously.  If you can appreciate the originals without being a fan of the sequels, then you have much greater appreciation for the originals.  Second, I don' like the way some of the characters are introduced.  For example, R2D2 is given a whole chapter about his time in Mos Eisley and is referred to a lot throughout the novel.  I guess this is to try and create the impression that R2 is like R2-D2.  But this chapter is completely pointless.  At one point, R3-D3 is introduced and he is referred several times throughout the book to be R2's little brother.  This character is so flat and so uninteresting that it was annoying.  Finally, this is probably the biggest problem:  In this novel, we are introduced to a bunch of people who are either dead or in hibernation.  In the original film, Han Solo is in hibernating mode for almost the entire movie.  It was a refreshing change of pace, and it made the movie feel much more like a Star Wars movie. In this book, we meet a bunch more people who have not yet awakened from hibernation, and they are introduced throughout the entire book.  The problem is that these people are constantly referred to as "dead" or "hibernating."  This is just annoying. The whole thing is a little weird, and you really have to struggle to find anything worthwhile to say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I was going to read a book about how we became a nation of selfish morons, I'd pick a different one, but I guess the authors really don't care.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've only had a few hours to read this book but from the very first page it is clear that the author knows nothing about American history or American culture.  It is clear from the beginning that this is not going to be a good historical account.  If anything, it will be just another book about America in the 19th Century.  The main character is, of course, the American slave named John Henry.  There are three different sections that I found interesting.  First, it is obvious that this was not written with a degree of historical accuracy.  From the beginning he speaks like a 19th century European who has learned nothing but American history, a history of the Civil War and Reconstruction (with which John Henry had some personal experience) and a history with some negative connotations (including slavery).  This is especially ironic because John Henry and most of his family are descendants of immigrants from France and Ireland.  This, of all things, should make the book a hit but the book fails to take advantage of the opportunity.  As far as the first chapter goes, the author has a good idea of who John Henry is.  He is a great example of a slave that does not want to be free.  Then, he goes on to talk about the history of abolition in the American colonies.  Unfortunately, the chapter only touches on this in the context of the North's involvement in freeing slaves and not the South's own involvement in liberating slaves.  Finally, the book goes into a section that does take place in the South but is not very informative.   These things really should be the point of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I was disappointed. I didn't like the idea of a self-help book based on the fact that most of my life problems are the result of my own bad choices, or that I am not a good leader. The self-confidence concept and the notion that women are not to be taken seriously as a group is annoying. It was a waste of my time and I would have been better off reading an unrelated self-improvement book that is more suitable for men.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's so bad    it's good  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of science fiction, and as a result, I have enjoyed a lot of books on this genre.  Unfortunately, this one didn't do it for me.   This book is based on a very popular game from a few decades ago.  It was about a group of people who use computers to battle each other.  This sounds a bit like a children's book, but the game's actual purpose was to make it more difficult to match wits against another player.  That was good enough for the game designers, but it didn't make for good writing.  The story is told in a way that makes me wonder if the author has any sort of mental problems, but in all honesty, I didn't really find anything in the story that would make me say that I wanted to see the characters in a mental institution.  I think the book could have been a bit more entertaining, but overall, I still enjoyed the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of errors and so poor in content that I am surprised that any decent publisher would give it away. It should be required reading for every high school English teacher. It contains many grammatical errors and is poorly written. It is so long that the content is barely covered. It's very misleading in its discussion of the meaning of the word "bacon." Most grammarians and dictionaries describe the word as meaning either "the white meat of a pig" or "fat meat from a pig." However, it is used more than one way in the text. In the second chapter, it's called "the yellowish brown material of a fresh-cut pork chop" and in the first chapter, "pig's fat." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that I read this book expecting it to be more than it is.  The main problem is the use of the word "fascinating" throughout the book.  I found the word too many times to be interesting.  But, that's just the book being too dumbed down for the public at large.  Also, the author goes on about how the book will change peoples' lives and make them realize the true nature of religion.  As a Christian, I was never a "heretic" but I found his point to be very well-taken.  In fact, it is the very thing that most of us need to realize.  My problem with this book is that it was so good and so thought provoking and yet all it did was provide information that will not have any effect.  Perhaps a less dumbed-down version would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book. However, after reading it, I couldn't put it down. It wasn't because the author's style was so entertaining, or because I thought the story was engaging, but rather because I was so engrossed in the subject matter, that I had a hard time putting down. The story centers around a teenage girl who develops telekinetic powers after an accident during a sports competition. As she is able to control the game in which she participates, she gradually discovers that she can manipulate the things around her as well. This leads her to believe that she is not the only one who has these powers. The author's goal with the book was to show the effects this kind of power can have on a person and to show that it is possible to have a normal life as well as to develop new abilities. However I felt that the way the book portrayed these developments and the way she went about proving the existence of others who have similar abilities was incredibly confusing. Even after being able to read the book, it was difficult for me to understand the author when she used the same techniques that she employed to demonstrate the power of others. I felt as though I were being told all the time that she was demonstrating the same ability with different words, but that's simply not true. The only way the author can really explain what she did is to say that she just thought about it and wrote it down in order to do a thorough job on it, but I just didn't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a pathetic waste of time. It's not bad because it's an  abysmal excuse for a book. It is bad because, as a science-fiction and fantasy writer, I know it's not  good  to try to be a good  writer, but I can't help but be amazed that they had to put their all into this.  The  authors didn't just  put in the effort to write, they put in  the time. They didn't even bother to do a bad first draft. They did a second or third draft and then rewrote it.  Then, they did the same thing. And, this time, they  did a  first draft for the audiobook and then they rewrote the book for the audio.   I just can't even  take  this kind of stuff seriously 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In spite of all the good things in this book, it's quite clear that she's not very good at writing characters.  Even her very strong male characters are bland and shallow.  Her hero is a very boring and bland guy who is always stuck with one "mistake" and is never the hero (his "mistakes" are usually not that bad).  He's also very misogynistic, and his actions are usually just as morally wrong as he is.  In many ways, this is like a bad adaptation of a good movie (e.g. "The Last Samurai").  In fact, I wish the book was written as a movie (a good adaptation is also better than bad adaptation, but a bad one is worse than bad).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to try to understand the "American Dream".  As a "working" mother who works long hours, this book left me disappointed and confused.  I found the American Dream concept to be very confusing, and the authors failed to explain in the least how this concept works.  For example, how do people "buy back" the freedom from the "privilege" of being a part of the "dream"?  This made me very skeptical about the whole concept.  In my opinion, people simply have a hard time "owning" the American dream when their families have struggled to achieve it.  This concept is a "catch-all" that covers many problems in life that cannot be addressed with one simple formula.  It is a formula that can help you when you are not working hard enough, when you aren't getting paid enough, and when you feel stuck.  You will often be "too busy" to realize that you are missing out on many good opportunities, but this book explains why these opportunities have slipped away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was thoroughly bored by the book; so bored, in fact, that I put it down in frustration, without reading the last 2 pages. This was a waste of my time, and I gave it a 0 in my rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the first 50 pages or so, we meet a man who is convinced he is gay. After having sex with him, he realizes his sexuality is nothing like what he thinks it is. I found this book a very frustrating read for a number of reasons. The most glaring being that this book is written by a man. A gay man. As much as I want a male perspective on male issues, that perspective is too one-sided for my liking. While I'm sure many readers will find this book very enlightening, I'd rather read about female experiences than read a man's opinion. It's sad that a man with such insight needs to put his own words out there for others to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part of this book is the title. What could a book titled The Death of an American Master really be about? I never realized how many Americans who have come to be known as great masters of the art of Chinese martial arts have actually died in China before reaching their 20s and early 30s, including such martial arts luminaries as Sun Yat-sen, Fu-tao, Chiang Kai-shek, and other great masters. It is almost as though America is exporting the art as if to say "We are the best" while the rest of the world struggles to keep up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you read this book and decide to read it again, I'm sorry but it's not worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book after having read it a number of times over the years.  While I do understand that these events are historical, they are presented in such a way that they have been presented throughout the ages and the world.  In addition to the usual historical errors and questionable references,  the author repeatedly references Biblical stories  without acknowledging  that they are just that, stories.  And in one particular case, when she makes reference to the Book of Revelation, she writes as if it was just another old story.  If she had a book like this, she could have called it "I Don't Believe in Anything."  Unfortunately, she just took some of the worst parts of the Bible and used them as part of a fantasy  novel.  It is an excellent fantasy  story, but it does not deserve a five star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that this book is a horrible example of how to teach history. The first thing it does is attempt to prove that the American Revolution was a great revolution, even though the British had no reason to invade North America. This is a common myth about American history (e.g., the "long, protracted war" between the Revolutionary War and the American Civil War), and it's a very bad idea. First of all, most of the American colonies had long histories of peace and prosperity, which made a war with the United Kingdom much less likely, but even if there had been a war in North America, we might not have lost. The main reason the British invaded North America was the War of 1812, which was triggered by a border dispute between the United States and Great Britain. American rebels attacked British ships in international waters and killed over 100 British sailors, and, more importantly, it was the most effective way of bringing about a negotiated settlement to the border dispute. The American Revolution had more to do with a revolution in the British constitution that was taking place during the War, which resulted in the creation of the British parliament. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a bad bad book.  The author is incompetent as an author and a journalist.  He does not write the kind of book one would expect in a professional publication.  There are several stories that are so absurdly inaccurate, one would never believe them even if they were written by the authors.  This is a book about the author's life.  It's about his love of the 1960s.  But there is not even a smidgen of truth in any of the stories he tells.  One would think that this book would make it to the Times as a best-seller.  Sadly, it is an embarrassment to the publishing industry.  I wish I could give it zero stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete disaster.   It's not only a waste of your time, it's a disaster of a read.  I tried to like it a little bit, but once you get past the first page, the story falls flat.  The characters are so unbelievable that you wonder what in the world the author ever thought up.  In the end, the entire story was a huge bore, as if the author just didn't have a lot of confidence in the actual narrative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, there are numerous flaws and the author, though a journalist, is not very experienced in the subject matter. For example, he talks about the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as though it was an interesting historical research exercise. As a student of political science, this makes no sense, as neither Israel nor Palestine ever had a legitimate claim on the land of biblical Palestine. Palestine is a country which was not yet founded, having been conquered by the Babylonian Empire from the 10th to the 15th centuries B.C. The only legal claim that existed to the land was the Kingdom of Israel's claim to it. So, by talking about the "historical" history, he is essentially writing about the legal history, which, like the historical events, is simply irrelevant. The other major problem with the book is that, as far as the actual history is concerned, it is pure fiction. It makes no attempt to account for the existence of Jewish history as a part of the history and heritage of Arab civilization, as a consequence of the Arab conquest of the land. It does not even attempt to explain the fact that it was not until the mid-19th century, with the birth of the Zionist movement and with the establishment of the state of Israel, that Jews could become a partaking citizen of their new home. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I finished reading the book about the birth of Jesus on a Sunday. What I thought was an interesting premise turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.  In his conclusion, Kirk had something interesting to say about a variety of things: the relationship between Jesus and the Pharisees, the relationship of the early church to the Greco-Roman world, the role of women, the nature of the New Testament, and even a little something about the significance of the four gospels.  Unfortunately, this was the least interesting aspect of his discussion.  He spent more time complaining about how difficult it is to follow the teachings of the Church and Jesus (while conveniently overlooking the easy access and variety of materials available to everyone else), how people of his generation don't understand the importance of the gospels (despite the fact that he himself never got around to reading them), and how the new gospels contain all sorts of errors that can't be easily removed (while ignoring the abundant errors that are there anyway, even in his own day).  Unfortunately this was an even worse summary of his own book.  His thesis was interesting enough, but this was all too much "filler" that didn't add to the overall picture.  I would have preferred a good story about Jesus' birth that was worth reading, but I'll have to stick to the more enjoyable writings of others instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most infuriating thing about this book is that it doesn't know it is a book about the Holocaust and doesn't even try to disguise it. The book is so obviously, so shamelessly, trying to be clever by making use of the most horrendous event in human history that the author even calls the title of the book, as if it were an insult. The idea that any Jew could not survive the horrors of the Holocaust, and that any Nazi who did survive could not be punished for his crimes, is such a joke that it is almost unbelievable that it could ever be taken seriously. In the final chapter, the author claims that he believes that the German people have been psychologically damaged by the experience of the Nazis:  In the German mind, there is a sort of stigma attached to a particular group: any member of that group is a potential threat to the well-being of other members of that specific group.  When a young, healthy Jew in 1933 was confronted with the reality of the extermination of his people, he was, for some reason, psychologically paralyzed by fear and grief.  He tried to hide it. In some ways, the Germans themselves were the victims of the psychological paralysis.  This book is meant to address the "psychological damage" of the German psyche 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is bad. It is clear that her editor had nothing much to do with this book, and that there were significant problems with her research.  The problem is, she has no idea what research is, or how it works. It was a waste of time, and a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not the biggest fan of paranormal romance but this book left me cold. There is too much talk of religion and the occult in this book. There's one chapter about a demon of a demon being caught and tortured in the presence of his wife, and another about a man who, when he got a taste of his own medicine, started to act very strange.   The last chapter deals with the life and career of Charles Dexter Ward, a famous psychic with whom I've never read a book.  I don't know what the author of this book is trying to do, but I don' t think that it succeeds. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book! The only flaw I noticed was that I did not really like the ending! However, it was still a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a bad read: too long (for a book about science, I mean), too academic, not up to scientific standards. I was hoping for a fun romp through the science of evolution, but I got more of a dry, technical and boring presentation that reminded me of a good text book: Biology, v. 2.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a huge disappointment for me.  I was expecting more out of a science book and this one was just a rehashing of a bunch of previous work.  If you're really into physics you may like this book but I'm not.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book makes me realize that if there is no God, then there is nothing. As a Christian, I've found that people like me get all the advantages of a great society without having to pay for it (like the right to vote). There are no Christians in my life, but I'm a secularist and I'll be happy until the day I die. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you haven't read The Handmaid's Tale yet, don't worry, you'll have to wait.   The book is so well-written that it almost makes up for the lack of entertainment value (or entertainment value alone, depending on your perspective).  But as a whole, it's a lackluster read that does not hold up to later analysis and discussion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is pretty bad for a first book. The characters are not complex and their motivations don't seem to justify their actions. I found the whole thing pretty depressing. The author could have written better for her first book, but then I would have had to read a lot more of her books to catch up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't like this book.  It was boring and slow, and it felt too much like a biography of a person.   I can't imagine what he was doing in the woods when the Nazis came looking for him, but he came out and killed them.  The plot is weak and predictable and the characters feel shallow and one-dimensional. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the title was a little ironic given the way he used to be in the Navy. He was very bright, very well read, a good talker and so on. He had all the qualities one would want to join the navy.  It's all changed.  The title is accurate in the sense that he was the "smartest" person in his group and now has dropped off the radar. In his pre-navy days he was very much an athlete and he can no longer even ride a bike. In other words he is as dumb as a box of rocks. I was hoping to read something that was different than what I have come to expect from him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't usually read YA books, but I had to pick this one up due to its popularity.  The protagonist, Taylor, is a strong, capable teenage girl with a good heart and a strong moral sense.  I did have to stop reading her story for a few chapters because she kept jumping to conclusions, even when no one else did.  As a child, I thought my family was too rigid for my personality.  But, by the time Taylor reaches her late teens, she's starting to accept that her parents were just too rigid and that she can be free.   That was nice.  However, I couldn't help but feel that Taylor's parents were the "bad guys" in this story.  They were judgmental, controlling, and hypocritical at times, and they made excuses for bad behavior as if it was a part of "growing up."  If they didn't want her, then she should have stayed home!  The main "bad guy" in the story was her high school English teacher.  She was so controlling that Taylor was constantly late to school, couldn't get along with her fellow classmates, and had to make up excuses to avoid her.  Her actions seemed even more bizarre when one considers that she taught the same class as Taylor's mother.  Unfortunately, this book was about Taylor's relationship with her mother and not her relationship with a new boyfriend.  Even so, I would have liked more from Taylor's friendship with her English teacher, and I was disappointed that we didn't hear from Taylor much about her new boyfriend in the last two-thirds of the book.  It would have been nice to see Taylor's reaction to how her new friend treated her mother.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book thinking it would be an interesting look at the rise of Islam in the Islamic world in the 7th century CE.  I was disappointed.  Despite some interesting insights and some excellent analysis of Islamic legal thought, the book suffers from an obvious inability to provide convincing evidence.  The author spends a lot of time recounting Islamic historical figures such as Hamza, Abd al-Rahman, and Abu Bakr, but fails to provide any information about what they said, what they did, and even who they were.  While the author discusses some contemporary Muslim scholars, he doesn't mention them at all.  In other cases, the author simply repeats quotes from the Koran without providing any citations.  None of this is particularly surprising, of course.  Scholars are not supposed to be able to produce evidence like that.  Instead, I found myself thinking, Why bother trying to produce a work of scholarship if you can't produce evidence for the conclusions you want to reach?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As much as I want to like this book I find it so poor in every respect that I just can't read it. I can't believe this is not one of the best fiction books on the shelves. The narrator, with his poor grammar and poor sense of humor, just doesn't capture the mood of a good story. The writing style is stilted and awkward, the characters are flat, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and it all just screams, "This is a bad novel." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to reading this book, but had to look it up at the library and I couldn't.  I thought I could at least get a look at the formatting. I just hope this doesn't have the same negative reviews that others have given to other books I've read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book, but I did not enjoy the ending.  While the book starts out reasonably well, things eventually get very bad for a number of characters.  The author really seems to take his inspiration from a number Hollywood movies, with a particularly bad performance from Will Smith, and then comes out with a completely unsatisfactory ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a little bit skeptical of this book, as many of his other books seem to be "one-offs." I read "The Little Blue Book of Good Fortune" and "The Art of Saying No to Fortune" (which I'm glad I did), and while they had good, practical advice, I was disappointed that they didn't seem as original or important as the other books. However, it turns out that they were both written by the same guy: A. A. Stoddard, founder of the Stoddards Press. Sturdard's "The Stoddart Method" is a simple, yet powerful method of developing a good and fulfilling life.  His books are always a nice, light read, and, in my opinion, he does provide a good approach to achieving your personal goals. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books that reads like a bad television show, with all the clichés, bad acting, bad dialogue, and bad characters. The characters are all just the same two characters, the hero and the villain, and they talk in the same way, sounding like two people who have never met each other before and want to be friends. At one point, the villain says something like, "All good men have fallen in love, but not this one." This is as lame as it gets. The writing is atrocious.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of the "mixed up" genre. It seems to me that the genre is used to cover up the fact that the author is either a total bad writer, or simply bad at writing. I think that it is a shame that the mixed up genre is more popular than the real deal, which is probably the best type of book: a bad author writes a bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a world where there is so much negative news and such a high number of books on death, I feel like I have been reading one after another. In this case, I find a lot of that negative news to be completely false. The main problem I had with the book is that the author seems to be trying to make a "case" against death, even if it has nothing to do with the topic at hand. She seems to think that people are in denial about death and just want to cling to life. I think she overstates the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife and I recently finished reading The Power of Habit  by Charles Duhigg. We liked it very much, but we found it frustrating because it is so hard to keep a good habit when it is going to be hard to stay on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a poorly written book about the history of the Catholic Church and the corruption of the Vatican. The Vatican was not just a minor player in this corruption. It was a major player, and the cardinals who ran it were corrupt. The cardinals made themselves rich through the crimes and corruption they committed.  There was no public scandal, just a secret agreement with a rich friend.  The book's history has a long and unfortunate chapter on the American media's attitude toward Pope John Paul II. The media treated him like a saint and as if he were going to return to Rome in 2004.  And that was the whole point.  His return would have brought the Catholic bishops to power in the States, and would have been a step toward restoring the Catholic faith in America.  This is why the American people elected the first Protestant Pope in a century.  But the American press treated him with contempt and refused to report on him or his accomplishments.  I'm not trying to say that this book is an entirely accurate account of the events that led up to the collapse of the Roman Catholic Church. It is not. But I'm also not trying here to give a negative critique. I think the book is very well written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Well, I think I'll have to cut this book a little too short. It has all the trappings of a good urban fantasy plot:  The hero is a half-breed half-human.  The heroine is a strong, intelligent, tough woman.  I liked the relationship between her and the hero, and their relationship was realistic.  Even the ending was well thought out.  But after the hero and heroine are caught in the middle of a political plot, you start getting a bad feeling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited about this book, but I've found it to be an extremely disappointing book.  The author begins the book with a series of short stories that are very good, but in the end they are so weak they could have been taken out of the book in favor of more memorable stories.  It's not that the stories are bad, but the way they're told is.  There are no character development or plot development.  Instead the focus is on the characters and their development, which is not a bad thing by itself, but it becomes tiresome very quickly.  I'd rather be entertained by the characters' actions rather than their thoughts, especially when the characters are so passive-aggressive that you feel for them.  As for the prose style, it is so heavy handed and wordy that I'm surprised the author didn't decide to make it more conversational to be more palatable.  Overall I don't think I will be returning to this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, but it fell flat for me.  As a reader who loves romance, I was extremely eager to read this book because I knew so much about the genre.  Unfortunately, this was not a book I found engaging.  The story is fairly interesting, and the characters are charming, but   The writing was poor throughout, especially when the characters were talking about their own life experiences.  It wasn't just the characters who were bad - the book itself was bad too.  A lot of the topics were very old-fashioned - people still buying and selling things, old women not knowing how to read, and how people really didn't want to live in the cities.  These are all pretty outdated and silly issues, but the writing seemed to put a lot of thought into them, so why throw them in there? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book, but I just can't get into it. The language is pretty bad and the subject matter just doesn't interest me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a child, I loved the book, especially the part where an octopus talks about how he loves a woman.  In this book, Octopus says that a woman with a "slim figure, small breasts, and a little boy" is one of his favorite things in the world.   I have no idea why he says this, because I'm a woman and I love my own body, my firm breasts and my ample belly.  Octopus makes no bones about it: he likes women like that.  Even a woman he was "dating," the woman he slept with one night when she couldn't afford dinner.  He calls her "stupid" for being single.  I think there was also something in this book that made me hate myself.  It's not that Octopus thinks I'm "fat," but I know that if I wanted to have children someday, I'd have to lose weight and have children sooner or later.  There is no way I can have children now, even if I want to.  The thought of it makes my stomach churn.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked this book. I thought it was very well written and well presented. However, it is not a good book for the reasons that one might expect. The first problem is that the author seems to have no problem with the use of the term "man-hating" in describing the behavior of men. He does not seem to want to get into the nitty gritty of this issue, but I suppose that he is too busy writing a book about man-hustling to spend time thinking about it. The other problem is the fact that the book is not written as a history book. The history book, in this case, is the man's book. As with the title of the book, this one does not have a lot of historical context. What context is there to go on? For the most part, the book refers to other books by male authors, but the other books in question are written for women and not written by men. It appears to me that the only reason the authors used these books to make a point about "man hating" was because the men in question did not agree with the men who did use those books to support their argument. But if we use the books as a tool, then it doesn't really make a difference if the authors use them to support or criticize their position. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The prose is so uneven that it makes the book look like a first draft, which it really is.   It was not until the second section that I could begin to comprehend what they were saying.  The most striking example is an argument that the United States, unlike Russia, has never had to pay reparations to the victims of Nazism, which the book's author claims they never did.  Even though this argument is common in history texts, I found it hard to believe that people with access to primary documents actually believe it.  This argument is particularly ridiculous in light of the fact that the Soviets have paid reparations several times since then.  Perhaps this is another reason why historical writing is so bad: it's hard to convince anyone that a particular position is right and the opposing position is wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had no problem reading this novel as a young girl. The writing is engaging, the characterizations vivid, the tone of voice natural and the theme of childhood trauma plausible. But the novel suffers from a major flaw, that being its portrayal of sexual abuse.  The child molestation and sexualized violence against the character Mimi is an uncomfortable, jarring, and offensive departure from the normal, benign portrayal of the child that most children get to grow up reading about in the books, and is an especially bad example of this genre.  What makes it even worse is that this abuse is not presented as any more serious than physical abuse that occurs at home or in a playground.  It is seen as something that is often done by parents who know how to use words to get the best of their children, in a consensual or non-consensual sexual act.  This is not only a disgusting, offensive, and disrespectful representation of sexual and emotional abuse, but also a completely irresponsible approach to telling the story of Mimi.  I was shocked that so many people I had known and respected had actually read this book and had not reacted with outrage.  A few years after I read this novel, I was contacted by a child protection agency in the area that had discovered that one of their clients had read and used this book to justify abusing their child, and I had to tell them that they should consider suing this particular author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I finished this book and have to say that I'm disappointed.   This is a long book and there is an awful lot of stuff to read about, but there were just too many typos and omissions that bothered me.  It's hard to keep track of the names of the characters because of their various spellings, the same author had written them differently and they were all so similar that I got lost.  That's a common problem with authors, especially of this genre, and one that should have been caught.  This book reads as if someone spent hours reading over the original manuscript and then cut and pasted some of the relevant parts together and wrote the book.  The main character's name (the only one whose name I didn't catch) was spelled "Waltz" twice.  (One of his sisters was named "Dancer" and the other "Wasp" in the original, but that's because she's one of the girls in the novel.)  That was also spelled "Gretchen" twice in the text.  In addition to that, one of his daughters has a different first name than the one in the source material (the book's character was a boy in the book and I think that's why it's spelled differently), and the names "Fruitcake" and "Biscuit" are spelled "Pudding" and "'c" respectively.  These are just a few examples and there are so many more that it becomes frustrating.  I do wonder if the author had a real problem with the names in his novel, but I doubt that.  There's so much interesting material in this novel, so many wonderful stories, that it makes me want to read the original book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has created the image of the modern witch as a conniving, power-hungry woman, which is both untrue and insulting.  As an academic, I can say that witchcraft is a worldwide phenomena that has always existed, even though there is little or no literature about it in Western languages.  The witch as villain character is a creation of the 19th century and was intended to provide a contrast with the good witch, the good wife, the pure and good maiden who was expected to be the epitome of virtue.  In reality, the witch was often a woman who believed in the need to control her own fate and in the role of the female as servant and accomplice to male power.  Witchcraft has always been associated with women who lived in a society dominated by men.  Even if one chooses to believe that modern witches are evil, their roots go back to a much earlier time in human history.  If witches were truly evil, why would they spend so much of their time and energy controlling their lives and family?  I was also disappointed in how the book presented witchcraft as a form of superstition rather than a real religion.  I am very open-minded about other beliefs, and I am also happy to admit that I have not found any proof that witches walk among us.  However, I found the author's interpretation of how the church views witches to be incorrect.  Modern witch-hunters are not seeking to rid the world of witchcraft; they are trying to rid themselves of the "witch" part of their names.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book very irritating in its tone, and even more annoying in its content.  While I found it hard to disagree with the central thesis that most modern works of art are worthless (including such classics as Hamlet and The Grapes of Wrath), I found its arguments that modern artists have an almost pathological dislike of modern art (including, of course, painting, music, and poetry) and a severe case of 'dorkism' particularly amusing.  I guess I should be happy that someone finally managed to come up with an insult that would make people like art. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The thing that really irked me about this book was the lack of any critical reflection on the state of our culture and economy, and the total absence of any attempt to explain why, if everything is so terrible, it's so difficult to fix. I am an economist. I have studied this issue for many years. The book by Rorty and Glaude is called "The Death of Economics." This is a direct riposte to it. They write that the "death of economics" occurred at precisely the time the book was written.    It was the book that first put the blame for the demise of the middle class on our declining standard of living.  The only "death" Rortys and Glasses mention is that of the great majority of our intellectual giants -- the "cult" of Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman, and Robert Nozick. I'm not sure I agree.  I think the death of economic reasoning was more like the death by a thousand cuts.  As a society, we have accepted many of the worst things about capitalism, yet we've still been able to maintain a relatively thriving economy.  Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to do so. I've worked in finance for almost twenty years.  In that time, I've never seen the average investor "go broke."  Most of us invest with the expectation that at some point the value of our investment will go down.  And, when that happens, we buy back more shares.  So long as there's enough demand, it doesn't matter that the value is going down. The reason, of course, is that no one knows the value in the first place.  There's just a certain point at which someone is too optimistic about their estimate of the future.  That's when we should sell our shares and buy something else.  But it's the average guy, the middle manager, who's going to get burned.  When he invests in his 401(k), he knows he's going down a path, and he also knows he might lose some money on the way down. This may seem like an irrational fear.  After all, why should anyone care about the price of his 401K? But it turns out that we have no idea what the market will do in the future, or even whether it will buy anything at all.  Why would anyone ever take a chance on this?  In a sense, it could be said
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never been a big fan of horror. I am always going to be an old hippie like that. I read this book because the "literary" description makes it sound interesting. I guess that is all I need from a book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book, and the publisher is taking the blame.  This book is an amalgamation of old and modern science, and it makes little sense.  The first half is about the history of science and the discovery of new things.  Then in the second half, there is a bunch of anecdotes and science that supposedly didn't happen.  I found it hard to believe that most of the things that didn't actually happen in the past actually did, or that it was actually possible that things that have not happened could happen....  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like fantasy.   Fantasy is generally dull.  This book is even more of a bore.  You won't be able to find anything new or interesting in it.  It's just a bunch of old tropes tossed into a blender.  I am so tired of this kind of book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is poor; the book tries to be a scholarly study and is mostly an advertisement for certain specific books, but only a few of the chapters seem interesting or even pertinent.   For example, one chapter is titled, "Why it's important to understand that the history of a given time period is the history that matters."  Not really.  That was a quote from a book about a time period that's not interesting enough to justify spending more time on.  The author's analysis of various aspects of the book's "philosophy" is mostly speculation, but he makes some valid points about the lack of research and the use of questionable evidence. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a big disappointment, mostly because it is not a good representation of human psychology. For example, the premise is that a baby can sense pain at the time it is born. This is so patently false, and there are so many other problems, that the author's thesis falls apart within the first few pages. The book begins with a chapter about a couple who adopt a "recovery" baby, who is actually very unhappy. It's as if the author has no conception of what a baby is like. It is not something to be "reactivated," or "rejuvenated." It is something that has to be nurtured, and that is just not possible with adoption. As I read the book, I came to the conclusion that the authors had not actually read this book, and were only basing their conclusions on what they thought others had read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for my husband, but he turned it down, and it's been on my shelf for a year now. It reads like an amateur's attempt to write a serious novel. He even says that he didn't read any of the other "serious" books before he started writing this one. He was just looking for something to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to review, but the actual writing makes it a bad review   The author claims that this was her first work, and it has a certain charm, but this book is an amateurish attempt to create a novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, as most of its predecessors, is basically a series of anecdotes in which a character tells another character a story and then the narrator interjects a question and opinion.  The stories often seem tacked on.  I would recommend it only for those who want to see how the "new" or "hip" generation thinks and talks about current events 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As much as I loved this book, I am disappointed it didn't live up to its promises.  I enjoyed a lot of what I read in this book.  The plot was interesting.  It was also good at keeping the focus on one person's thoughts and experiences.  She wrote well about how difficult it is to have a son in this day and age.  But, the last third of the book was a disappointment.  One of the characters had a heart attack after the death of his mother.  This was a good character.  However, the author was so focused on making the character's problems seem real that she missed the point of what he really was going through.  Maybe he was really angry at her for leaving him, but I was bored to death with the emotional scenes.   I did like the ending though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book expecting to have a laugh at the absurdity of its title. I did. The humor was dry, though. The main character has an overly perfect life with a perfect husband and perfect job, then decides to run away and live on the street with her dog. She finds a motel and meets a guy and stays up two days with him. The guy is in town for a week, so they go out and have a great time. They fall in love, and then decide to get married. She returns to work and he gets a new job that she wants but doesn't get because of his previous job. She tries to go back to work, but she has to go to counseling. They get divorced after one year, and after a year and a half they get back together. She gets a divorce and then he remarries after a while and they have a baby. The baby isn't all that great, and she has a heart attack and dies. The new husband thinks the baby is cute. After she dies he takes over her business and runs it very well. I found this book to be too depressing to enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading The Book of the New Sun and I am disappointed in the author's treatment of the gods and their place in human society. I thought he wrote a wonderful science fiction story in The Book Of The New Sun, a book I've already reread three times. In The Book... he has a lot of interesting things to say about the gods in human civilization (including the god of the desert) and he does a great job of portraying them as the most intelligent creatures in the universe. But the gods he writes about aren't much better. He says that the goddess Thoth is a very good-natured, gentle, and gentle-naturing creature who has been around forever but can't make up her mind which god to worship; however, she has a tendency to be a bit of a dick and if given the chance would worship the sun goddess, Asherah. Of course, Thoth's god is a tyrant and he would get rid of Thoth if given a chance. The god of chaos and confusion, Akhaten, is more evil than the other gods (which is probably why he hasn't been worshiped by humans), but Akhat's god has a habit of destroying everything in his path. He's also a bit too much like Satan (with his black eyes, long, dark hair, and long-lashed moustache) and as a result doesn't really seem to be all that different from him. I'm afraid that by presenting the gods as the same kind of mindless idiots that the rest of humanity is, the author has lost all credibility in the scientific community, or at least in a non-religious community.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is the worst book I've ever read. There is nothing good about it at all. I'll admit I really liked "Wizard: The Story of the Life and Times of Albert Einstein", by Arthur L. Danto (1946). It's got the same great premise - Einstein is a genius, and people think he is crazy. Danton is Einstein's childhood friend, and he wants to protect him from that perception. Dantes is a pompous jerk who gets in the way of Einstein's life. Dantons books are always good; Einstein's are always bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My second book from the author of The Glass Castle was about a woman in recovery from a failed marriage. I didn't like it at all. It was very one-sided and didn't provide any real advice or insight into the real issues in her life. This book was written to promote another book, which was about the author's recovery from alcoholism. I'm sorry that this book came out so late (she is supposed to have published this one by now) but that just adds insult to injury.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book, but I was disappointed.  It starts off really well, showing how to prepare a healthy diet and how to exercise for maximum benefits. It starts to go downhill after that though, with all the health advice (including how to get a good grade on a paper).  The author then jumps into her own health woes, complaining that she has been dealing with terrible chronic illnesses in her life.  She gets into a lot of details, then shows how she is suffering from various medical conditions.  The problems she mentions seem to be of the chronic and/or serious variety.  Not sure what the author is trying to do here, but it seems like she is trying too hard to sound like the health guru who was so popular in the 1970s.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am still reeling from reading this book. I have been an atheist and a materialist for more than 50 years. I thought I had read all the books on the subject. When I began reading this one, I thought it was some sort of joke. I'm a little disappointed because it is written by a well-known scientist. I expected more from the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was interesting, but it's not worth the trouble and time I spent on it.  I don't like that most people who give these books 5-stars don't do so because they enjoyed reading it. They're not that interested in the subject matter, so why waste time reading a novel that is so dull?   It seems like the author has made up her mind about the topic and has only decided to write a book in order to prove it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My opinion of this book was initially negative until I was confronted by the appalling quality of this translation. The main translation by A.R. Landa is atrocious: grammatical errors, missing words, a failure to distinguish between two distinct verbs, an inexplicable reliance on "says" for "is", and a host of other odd and awkward things. The new translation by Alan Garner is much better: it has a more consistent, standard, and effective style, it does not rely on "has" for what one would normally expect from a verb, it uses "said" and "said," and it preserves the original sense of "was" even as it creates problems for the translator.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son, who is the least literary person in the world, loved this book. I was disappointed that the characters (especially the male characters) were so stereotyped.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not interested in the history of the LDS church as it is practiced today. I am interested in how the church functions when the founder is dead. As you know, President Hinckley's death in April 1998 is the main topic of this book. I read it in a week and a half (in the same week), in two days, while traveling and in one sitting. If you want to understand the church's history as it exists today, this book is a very good way of doing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting this book to be the best book about Jesus ever written. I was wrong.   Jesus and the Victory of God   is written in a  style that is  almost  self-important and  pretentious.  I don't mean to make  comparisons.  But I feel like this book is so  much more  important  and significant  than the other books about Jesus that  this one is the only one that  actually  deserves to be called a classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book.  I wanted to believe that it was a good summary of the scientific research on the connection between diet and chronic disease.  Instead, I found a sloppy and unreliable book.   It is not difficult to find medical articles about the obesity epidemic in this country.  The problems with the medical literature have been well documented.  Most of the research is unreliable.   If someone was trying to make a case that weight is bad for your health, I would expect more than a few studies that show that there are significant health benefits to weight loss.   This book does not provide such support.   The most disturbing aspects of the book were the anecdotes.  As a researcher who has studied this issue extensively, I am offended by the suggestion that there is something uniquely unhealthy about being fat.   There are many different ways to have a bad health, and fat people are not the only ones to have them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book doesn't come off well. There are a lot of errors in this book. I can't say much more than that because it is a review book, not a critical analysis. However, the errors in the book are serious and many.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was interesting. I've always been interested in religious history, though I haven't been a serious reader of religious literature. I read this book in the library and then, in a fit of boredom, put it down. The next day, while doing some online research on the book, I came across a couple of comments by the author. In response to a complaint about his writing: "But I am not writing to defend myself against the accusation that I write bad prose." I found myself agreeing with him. The book is full of repetition and cliches, and he makes no attempt to distinguish between what is interesting about what he is writing about, and what is not. He just goes with what seems to be the flow of the narrative. He is not interested in what we would actually call "thoughtful writing" or "thought provoking prose." (I think I see a pattern here.) He seems to write for the masses, and not for the intellectual, the sophisticated or the sophisticatedly intellectual.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The novel is filled with the type of silly humor that has been the bane of my existence for years. This time, however, it was not funny at all. I read the last sentence of the novel to the narrator and was left with a sick feeling.   It had come to my attention that the narrator is a "psychopath" (which the author has done in the past, but I'm not sure how long ago that was), and it is his love interest who is the true victim. I find it difficult to read books about psychopaths when the author does not portray them as well as he does his characters. This book is just a sad, twisted attempt at humor for the sake of being funny, and it falls flat on its face.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book so much. But I was so let down by it that I had to return it.  First off, the book is poorly written.  The style is very formal and academic, which would make a lot of sense if the author wanted the book to be read by a class.  But it doesn't seem that way at all.  Secondly, the writing style doesn't make much sense at all, especially to someone who is very used to the standard, informal style of academic writing.  That said, the style could probably be improved by not going into too much detail on minor issues or by using more standard academic style.  At least I think I read the first two chapters correctly.  And the story is very compelling.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I have read in years.   The story of a man's search for true love and his own "true nature" is fascinating, but the execution is terrible.  Every scene is awkward, the dialogue is clunky, the writing is stilted, the characterization is weak.  The romance element is never fully developed, even when it's not obvious that the characters are destined to become a couple.  It feels contrived, like something that should be done to spice up the story for the sake of romance, but is never.  A sub-plot involving the "lost" sister of a famous composer that never quite makes it to the end of the book was also an unnecessary detour.  This one is also overlong, and there are also some unnecessary character death scenes.  My review probably won't be that interesting or compelling, but I was so annoyed with this book that I just didn't want to read it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've heard so many great things about this book that I was willing to give it a chance. Unfortunately, I couldn't stand this book's   style, which is too many sentences which just  go nowhere, and are too long. At  the end of  each paragraph, the author adds in a couple of sentences  which try to make up for the lack of substance.  Even though I was trying to finish this book  as fast as I could, I was at least six pages  in when I just gave up on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm disappointed.  My hopes were high that this would be a good book to read, but it turned out to be a book I didn't want to finish.  I can see the appeal of some of the ideas, but they have little practical application.  The author does offer some good critiques, but I don't think he has a good understanding of how the US government operates, and this leads him to make some pretty bad factual errors.  In this case, he even tries to suggest that some of Obama's actions are unconstitutional.   There are no constitutional grounds for denying citizenship to anyone who has committed a crime, so this is just the most extreme example of the kind of "constitutional" arguments that the author makes.  This type of argument doesn't have much to recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this one a try and found it totally useless.  I'm still annoyed about the "A" rating.  The author attempts to explain why the book has not been translated into English, but she doesn't really make any sense or present a cogent argument.  In fact, she's completely wrong about most of the book.  It makes even less sense once you read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with this book. The writing was bad and the prose was stilted and incoherent. The style was not as interesting as I thought it was going to be. I am glad I didn't waste any time reading this book, it was nothing but slogging through the same tedious material over and over. I was also not all that impressed with the main characters. The plot was predictable from the start.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited for this book. I've been trying to find a good biography of the great Billie Holiday  but so far have failed. This book is written by an actual Holiday's nephew and there is nothing wrong with that. However, I found myself very disappointed with a number of points   First off, Holiday wasn't just the "first lady" of jazz, she was a genius in a genre that was often a breeding ground for mediocrity   Her greatest songs were songs about loneliness  (I'm looking at you "Strange Fruit")   While most of her songs were written about her relationship with a man, she also wrote some about herself  (My Sweet, My True Love)  The truth is, she wrote about almost everything  (except how she'd met and married him, not that there's anything wrong with either of those )   Also, there is a really funny passage about Holiday's first marriage that I found quite insulting  (and I don't mean "slut" or "slag" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, Michael Portier writes about a lot of things: how a woman can take care of her kids better than a man; why it is OK for a woman to call a man a "cunt"; the evils of a liberal school system; why men need to be more assertive; why a woman shouldn't marry a man unless she has his approval; how women should only have sex with the man they love; and that women are only "objectified" by men because men don't have the right to reject a woman when she rejects them. He also states that the best way for a man to control a woman is to just treat her like a child or "a dog" or "someone who shouldn't be allowed to speak without being tasered" (I have no idea how any of this is relevant to this book), which makes you wonder if he was even born female. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's so bad it's good: a collection of bad romance novels I picked up in the library. I read them and tried to finish the ones I liked. The worst ones are the worst. One had a young woman who was "taken advantage of" by a man, another was a "bored, bitter, and bitter-minded old hag." The last one was the best, and I still have the copy. I didn't think it could be improved on. I think the original author was not a "successful" author, so it's all the more disappointing that this new publisher decided to try to improve it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, as many other critics have noted, uses the "pagan" or "camelot" motif too frequently in this book to the detriment of the book's theme.  I'm not necessarily saying the book is bad as a whole (although it is certainly full of holes, but these aren't necessarily "silly holes").  In fact, I enjoyed most of the little things that made the book a worthwhile read: the way the two of them get together to share a birthday dinner and the story about the time the two spent on a cruise together, or the way they use to go on a road trip together (although this is another story that, despite its entertainment value, doesn't quite work as well as it could have).  The book's main issue is that the book was written too hastily, using the two "heroes" as a crutch to get its themes across:  (I) What makes a hero?  (II) Why do men act like they do?  The lack of focus throughout the book really irritates me.  But that's really only my opinion:  My wife said that she found it amusing to listen to the audiobook version of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was all over the place, from the very first chapter in which the young boy gets the name of God by asking to be excused from school to the last, where he sees himself in the reflection of the mirror and feels like crying out in amazement.   I can't say that I enjoyed reading this book at all.  It had a certain "cool" factor to it at one point but I just didn't get it, even after all the rereads. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first 10 pages or so are fine, but there's a lack of any real plot and character development until the last 10 or so. As if the author had some ulterior motives in wanting to write a self-help book.  I was hoping for a real novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book, but it's not what I expected. It's about the work of a woman named Dorothy Day, a leader in the women's liberation movement of the 1960s.  She's a hero for me, and she's a terrible woman.  While writing this book, I thought, "That is why I hate her."  Not because she's evil, or because she makes me uncomfortable, but because she just makes me wish that there were someone else in this world who would want to be like her, and that it's her fault that it hasn't been easier for women to be themselves.  This is why Dorothy Day is such a horrible person.  I can't imagine what it would be like to be so self-centered and so out of touch that you would try to change society just for the hell of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is such a disappointment to the reader that he would like to have been the one to write the positive review.   The book is about the story of a young man and a little girl, and how the young girl's father became a heroin addict and died.  The story is told in the third person and the father's side of the story is not told.  Despite the author's good intentions, the story suffers from a lack of imagination and a lack of empathy.  This story could have been written by the daughter's mother and her friends and instead the book is written by a father who is so selfish that he is going to be a heroin addicted junkie and die alone.  It's not just a story about a father's addiction; it's a story of abandonment and abandonment.  For all the good that is said about the book, I can't imagine anyone wanting to read it or recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not interesting enough. The plot is basic.  The writing is not good enough either.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I wanted to read about a time when there was peace in the Middle East. I couldn't be happier with this book, except that it took too long to get to the meat of the book. I would have enjoyed reading about the Iran/Iraq War from this time, but what I got was the usual mix of propaganda, conspiracy, and outright falsehoods. It is very difficult to find something to read in the modern Middle East that isn't a conspiracy theory or is just outright wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending is not what I was expecting.  It ends with a bunch of young teenagers in the woods, smoking a joint.  I'm a big fan of the drug culture, but this book does not live up to its billing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this one after reading the other reviews about it being bad, so I ordered it. But as soon as I opened it up, I found that it's a book full of typos and bad writing. I don't have many bad things to say about any of the authors of novels I've read, but the writing is just awful for this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for a course in American literature at university.  It has become my favorite of all American writers, especially those who are considered "postmodern" or "post-modernist."  I find that this is usually a good thing because it makes them more interesting to me.  However, this book did nothing of the sort for me. I would have liked it better if it had been about a contemporary author (such as James Baldwin or W.E.B. Du Bois) and not one of the most obscure of American authors (such a thing was unheard of in the 1950s or 60s). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a problem with the narrator's delivery. It's hard to follow. His voice changes from a nasally voice that sounds like he's stoned (like in a bad "Hulu" movie) to a smooth voice that makes his point sound like he thinks he's talking to a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, and it was a complete and utter waste of my time.  The characters are bland, and the plot is contrived.  I would have preferred a more imaginative book where the hero (the protagonist of the book) and his partner (the female lead) are more interesting and likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried this book   on a whim   and it was a terrible waste of time.  It was full of factual errors and bad argumentation.  As an atheist, I'm disgusted   that a book like this would be published at all  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished reading this book by a fellow Christian but was disappointed in its content. I thought that he had found a way to explain God without using any biblical concepts or logic. I found him explaining his God in terms of his own personal experiences and desires to be able to communicate with people. His God was so strong that he did not have to have a physical body to communicate. I could feel the power of God in my own body, but that did not stop him from believing that the Bible and its message were true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book.  Unfortunately, it was a dud  I did not enjoy it at all and think it is poorly written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this one. It was supposed to be the "true" story of how the CIA (I guess?) developed the "special" program known as MKULTRA and got it started, in order to conduct psychological experiments on unsuspecting people in order find out how they could be used to their advantage and turn into "agents" for the CIA.  It turns out that there is not a lot of truth in that story.  Apparently, a lot was made out of a CIA meeting in 1953 that resulted in the creation of the "MKULTRA" project, but it was a lot more "spooky" than that.  For instance, a CIA man who went by the name of Dr. Black and who was an expert in "hypnosis" was brought in to study people at the suggestion of Dr Ewen Cameron, who worked for the agency for many years and whose wife had worked as a sex therapist for many of the people they were working with.  One of the subjects of the study was Dr. Cameron's assistant, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, who had been a CIA analyst during the Kennedy administration.  Cameron himself wrote that he felt that Dr. Gottlieber "had very intimate knowledge of the Agency's clandestine activities" and that "his intimate knowledge and connections in the Agency, its employees, and its overseas activities had made him the Agency 'go-to man' for many, if not most, of the covert operations which the Agency conducted."  At least one of the studies that Dr Cameron conducted involved Dr. Edward Condon, a researcher at Columbia University who had served in the military and had been assigned to work at MKULTREAT.  In the report about this work, Dr Condon said that he was "very anxious to do a study of some of the most promising young psychoanalysts who had come to our hospital for psychoanalyst training." Dr Cordon, a very enthusiastic and energetic man, wrote "many positive things about many of his patients" and even claimed that some of his "patient's reactions to the hypnosis technique he had developed were remarkably similar to those of the individual who had committed suicide two months earlier."  Dr. Condon claimed that he had been approached by a group of psychiatrists at Columbia who were interested in working with children who were believed to be involved in sexual exploitation.  "They were extremely concerned," he wrote, "about the lack of any empirical evidence showing
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book a few years ago but   found it difficult to finish after the first few pages because   it seemed so dry,   and  it didn't seem to follow a very interesting plot.   The book is so dry that it would have been great for a class. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was boring and boring, and I am a professor who spends more time in the library than reading.   I had to put down the book to get a drink of water.  I know that the book is not about UFOs but more about the military and how they think about the UFO phenomenon.  However, the author is very biased toward this viewpoint.  The author also makes many errors.  There is no evidence that the alleged Roswell crash actually took place.  It was in 1947.  Even more, he makes no mention of the "Mothman" sightings in Pennsylvania that were also in 1947, or that a woman in a car saw something that was not a person in a UFO, but a large winged object.  No one claims that they witnessed such a UFO.  Nor does the book mention the "Bog Man" who supposedly was killed by some mysterious flying object, only for a small child to claim it is still alive and well in his backyard. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As you can tell by this review, I am a huge fan of Stephen King's works. However, The Dark Tower   is so terrible I'm having a hard time buying the print edition!   The writing is horrendous   It is so badly written I could not take it seriously at all   When they get so far down the rabbit hole that they have to say things like, "The world may have had a very different start"   Or "In some sense the universe was always as it is now"  Or even "Our bodies are just vessels"  The worst part is when the author says, "This is what the 'Dark Tower' books are about"  Well, it is NOT ABOUT THE 'DROP' BUT THE STAGGING IN THE BUSH.  Even though there is no logical reason for it, they do it because it is in the 'right' place at the 'wrong' time.  What a waste of a good thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a bit hesitant about this book, but once I got into it, I really enjoyed it. It was a fairly typical book-length exercise in moral relativism: he discusses various moral rules and then writes a review of the rules that he finds the most moral. It's interesting that he would find the most strict moral rule a bad rule. I found the rules he found most immoral (such as the death penalty) to be fairly tame, and the rules with the least amount of potential for abuse (such a simple prohibition against killing a newborn baby) to actually be quite reasonable. The chapter on slavery was especially interesting, because of the surprising fact that the idea of slavery is generally seen as bad by most people. He points out that some cultures have a long history of slavery, and that slavery is still practiced in a number of places in the world today. He even cites the famous "The Merchant of Venice" as an argument against slavery, but then says, "Slavery was no longer necessary in Venice during the 17th century." I thought he was just being melodramatic at first, but I don't think he's kidding at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was one of the worst books I've read in a long time. It was poorly written, poorly paced, poorly organized, and poorly referenced. It's not that the material is bad; it's just that the way the author put it together was so terrible it was obvious he didn't read it and just wrote it from memory.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed that this book doesn't get more attention for being so bad.   In an age where children's literature is being re-evaluated, it is unfortunate that this series of books has remained popular because it features the "bad" children.  The story is boring, the characters are annoying, and the storyline is predictable.  This has been my experience with the series, and I know it will be yours too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book.   The plotline was interesting, the characters were likeable, and the writing style was good.  But at the end of the day, it was all about the plot and the characters, and it never took any of that away from me.  I didn't particularly enjoy the book, so I gave it three stars instead of four.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the first few chapters are all about the first book (and nothing else), you're likely to be disappointed. I did enjoy it, but I think I would have done better with other first books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know why I read this book. It was a bad read. There was no suspense. I didn't like the main character. She's a bitch. She has the appearance of a model, but she can't even get a date to a movie. She also has an obnoxious attitude. At one point, she claims she's a millionaire and she can get her own house. She can't get a driver's license, which is the same thing. She complains about the "dying out" of people. I don.t see it. I'm 50. I've had many relationships that ended very badly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book. The author says she had a hard time finishing it, but she was able to do so. She did, but it did not turn out very well. The stories do not make any sense. Sometimes she tells us what happens, but other times she just makes things up. We end up in the wrong place. There's an awful lot of confusion about what is going on. I suspect she did not write the first part, so she had to fill in the blanks. This is no good. It gets even worse when she uses the title of the book as an excuse to have things happen that were not there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible. The protagonist is a poor example of a modern day "faux-rich white man" -- or so he thinks he is. He's a fraud from day one and his only true friends are the stereotypical poor black men -- the "guinea pigs" he pretends to befriend. He takes on the role of "friend" in order to get his way with these poor black guys. He uses these poor guys in various ways to get what he wants. He has many "mistakes" in his scheme of things but never seems to learn. He is also a bad "friend", trying to get him to buy things he doesn't need in order for him to continue to "play the rich white man." He's all too happy to accept help from others to complete the game, even when it's not wanted or needed. He also tries to have "fellow" black guys as "guys" so that he can make his scheme work. He tries to use a lot of stereotypes and other people's problems to try to justify his own selfishness. He keeps running off and hiding from his mistakes but always returns, even if it means he gets caught. The whole book is a mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favorite book from the recent "futuristic" books in the SF genre (though it's really the only one of the bunch that doesn't seem "fantasy").  It really makes you want to dive right in and start writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete and utter waste of time.  I read it in an effort to learn a little more about my Germanic roots.  This is a good book, but it was written for a book club.  What they needed was something easy to read so they could keep up with the class, and this was it.  As a result, all of the words and expressions from the book were confusing to me, and I found myself having to do some searching to make sure that I was understood.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a copy of this book on a special deal from a public library.  The description of the book was, "From the author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Successful Marriage and the best selling work on the subject of 'love spells,' The Magic of Love is the most accessible and reliable guide to conjuring up the magic and emotional connection that exists between two people. "  There is a lot of magical thinking and self-deception in this book.  If I ever need love, I will go to a witch.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped that the author's recent books would have been more entertaining and stimulating.  I got the sense that the last one was more of the same 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book. The story is intriguing, the characters are interesting, and I got to like many of them. I also got a laugh out of a certain line. However, as soon as the book started getting serious, it became very difficult to enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For me, this was a total failure. I tried to be an enthusiastic reader, but this book left me disappointed. It is an awful book, the worst of the two books that came out in the last couple years that I found highly objectionable. It had a plot that was all wrong and a character that was completely unlikable. It was tedious and full of bad writing. It did not have much of a message either, as the ending was disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had great expectations from this book, but found it to be a tedious and repetitive piece of work.  The plot is about the last days of the Roman Empire, and revolves around the fact that the Romans have lost their grip on their empire, despite a successful war.  It has all the hallmarks of a standard fantasy book: magic, intrigue, and battles.  But the actual writing is tedious, and the main character, Roman General and General Lucius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, does little to advance the plot or develop his character.  Even the romance between Lucius and Octavia is tacked on as an afterthought.  If you're going to give fantasy a bad review, this is a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains some really bad ideas that have no place in a serious book on intelligence.  For example, he says that the number one way to get rid of the low IQ in children is to get them involved in a sport:  The number one answer to the problem of high IQ is sports. If we teach our children to play a sport, our children will not have low IQ.  He suggests that people with high IQs have an extra pair of hands called "intellectuals" or "soul workers." He claims that children with high intelligence tend to be good singers and that they can find other people who like to be with them when they sing. I didn't see any evidence for this, and I was very skeptical of it.  I find it extremely annoying to be told that I am doing something wrong because I like to sing.  This is exactly the kind of nonsense I've heard when dealing with intelligence.   But he's not done there. He claims to find support for his thesis in the work of the great American psychologist, Margaret Mead. He says:     Mead claimed that it is not what you are, but what you do that is important. This is very much like our culture. We tell children that it doesn't matter what they know or what they've done, because they've still got their "intuition" to help them out when times get hard.  But Mead did not think it was "the number one problem."  I have seen the number 1 on my SATs and a few other official test results.  The other tests that get this high are ones that I didn.t do well on, like those requiring math problems. I would have said that these tests are flawed and that I failed them, but in that case, why was I doing so well on the SAT and so poorly on some other test I got when I was not particularly good?   Mead's claim about the number of "intellects" in a population is a very common one, but this one seems to me to be just plain wrong. It's been shown that intelligence is strongly linked to the number and kind of things that one is good at doing.   People who are good at playing sports or writing poems or reading are not the same as people who are strong at playing video games or writing novels.  It's not true that "intelligent people" are good in every aspect of life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a big fan of paranormal or spiritual books but this book by Laura M. Hughes is not for me. She focuses mostly on psychics, healers and mediums. The main character in this book has a "tremendous gift" to tell the time to people in a time loop. It is a gift that is a curse because people can't stop talking about the time loop when they are not in it. It gets worse as the book goes on. She gets so involved with a spiritual group that she becomes a "prophet" and tries to convince people that she is the messiah. After she has a vision and a dream, she does a "life review" and the things that made her "wish" or "pray" during those times she was not in the time-loop are repeated. I am sorry for the rant I will have to write about the whole book, but I think it is time for my money to be put back into something else. It's not bad but there are many better books that focus on the paranormal or faith in general. I wish I was more impressed by Laura's book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As if the title wasn't enough, this book is really about two couples. The first couple, the characters in the book, are both from the same town. They meet while on a business trip and get engaged while in each other's company. They have an immediate attraction. They are even on the same beach. They even go out on a date. After they marry, they live happily ever after.   The second couple, and the character in the story, is from another town. In their first date, they are having a good time. They go to the same bar, go to a concert, and eat out together. They start dating, but the relationship is never great. It ends when the character discovers that the other person is gay. It is also pretty clear that the character is very unattractive, which leads him to consider a career in pornography.  I found myself feeling the exact same way I felt in the first chapter when I first met the first couple. I couldn't believe that they were so easy to fall in love with and that they could have a happy relationship that lasted over a decade. It made my head spin. It also made me feel the exact way I did when the second couple met in the second chapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was interesting but I really could not connect with it at all.  The characters sounded like they came from the same book or were clones from another book.  They were all the same age, the protagonist was the only one who knew anything about what was going on, the other people were just there to be there.  It was boring.  I guess it was supposed to be about the beginning of the internet and everyone getting on that thing, but it seems that's not really the case here.   I found the cover to be a bit silly, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a horrible book. It is written by someone who is clearly not well versed in either Christianity or history and I found it a travesty.  It would not have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that it is written in the voice of a man who is supposedly a scholar, a scholar who is apparently a competent writer.  He seems to think that he is a Christian apologist because he claims that it was Christians who fought against the Roman Empire in the 4th century.  This is simply not true.  If Christians fought against Rome, it is likely because it was a brutal, tyrannical and incompetent empire.  But to claim that they fought against it because they were Christians is a stretch.  They may have fought against a despotic emperor but that doesn't make them Christians.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In an attempt to be provocative and to raise the hackles of feminists, I have read this book and found it pathetic.  I am not a feminist and have never considered myself one.  However, this book raises the hackle of feminism.  It claims to examine the relationship between "mother" and "daughter" as if this is the only possible relationship between a father and a daughter.  This is not the case.  There are plenty of other relationships, including fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, etc., which have been ignored by modern "feminists."  This book ignores all the other fathers and mothers who, through their involvement with their daughters, helped her through her adolescence.   This was the father who, at age eighteen, helped his daughter with her problems, taught her the joys of being an adult, and helped her mature as a person.  He was a father to her "sister" through whom she could learn to mature as well as a father. This is a common theme in the book as it is by her brother (father figure), who teaches her to be a good woman.  When I read about the man who spent his life saving her from domestic abuse, it brought a tear to my eye.  And he never got a cent from her.  If the author was trying to point out that some fathers are too passive or unwilling, she was totally wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a former atheist who converted to Catholicism while at a Catholic seminary. The book is written in a breezy, non-denominational style, but I couldn't help noticing how similar some of the Catholic teachings were to many of the fundamentalist Protestant positions I used to hold.  The Catholic Church teaches that there is only one true God, and that God is perfect.  Also, it is believed that the Bible is the literal word of God.  (There is an interesting theological debate about whether that belief is true, but that is a different matter.)  The book claims that the Catholics are the only true Christians, even though the Bible teaches that salvation is available to everyone who asks God and believes.  In addition, it claims that all Catholics believe the same thing about the death penalty, even if they have different views about whether capital punishment is ever justifiable.  It also claims that, while the Church teaches women are inferior to men, it does not teach that women are to be treated as less than men.  While the book tries to make a distinction between gender roles in the Church and in secular society, it never really makes that distinction.  This is because the book is primarily written for Catholics.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am one of those people who really liked this book, which is funny because I did not. I was surprised to find that it really has no redeeming qualities, except to be a cheap, self-help book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While reading this book I was almost convinced that this book was written by an extremely bad person.  This book has so many errors that it would be easier to find a couple of hundred spelling mistakes in a dictionary than to spot them in this book.  I'm surprised that even the book's publisher could put it together and print it at all.   I am still trying to figure out exactly what the author believes he knows about Mormonism and his history.  Maybe it's because he's always been an angry Mormon, but he always seems to have this strange obsession with Mormon history. Even if you ignore the errors and the fact that he writes so inaccurately, this book is just so poorly written that it's hard to take seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was not my cup of tea. I don't find any interesting plot, and I found the characters so flat that I couldn't keep myself interested in the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book so much that I threw it in the garbage.  First, the author tries to explain how the earth has cooled at the same time that the sun has warmed, which seems to me to be one of the most bizarre claims ever made.  Then he makes a completely non-scientific claim that the Earth has been cooling since about 1600 AD.  Why is he claiming that the earth was cooling in 1600 when scientists now believe the earth is warming?  Then the author says that he was wrong in asserting that the "Great Flood" occurred in the 5th century bc, when now there is substantial archaeological evidence that it was more recently than that.  The author says he is right in saying that the Bible is a collection of stories and that these stories have been "corrupted" by human influence.  It is now clear that he is simply a fundamentalist who believes that if the Bible tells the story of Noah's ark and the flood correctly, it must be true, but that if it says something else, then that somehow means the Bible must be wrong.  I'm glad he is not on a mission to convert non-believers, but he has taken so much work out of the task of defending the Bible against the critics that it's a wonder he doesn't quit. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read some of the reviews for this book and I found the book to be very negative. For me, I just didn't see much that was good in it. There's a lot of poor writing, poor historical information, and poor argumentation.   The book is written in the first person, which I'm always very suspicious of.  In fact, I can't find an example of the author saying that a person can't say that he or she was a child soldier because the historical evidence doesn't support it.  Also, this book takes the position that because the Allies came to power in 1945, they are morally superior to the Axis Powers because they liberated more people and also freed the Jews.  I've read many books that have the exact opposite position and this book was no exception.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was just so boring.  I liked many of the quotes from other authors I read, but I had to put this one down after the first 10 pages.  Not one of the authors I knew quoted from this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As an academic who has to publish research papers to get tenure, this book was not worth my time and effort.   It is an attempt to prove a particular point about the origin of religion: that it was a reaction to a perceived "secularization" of the Western world.  The basic argument is that "secularity" had led to a decline in religious activity, which had become a sort of "anti-religious" cult (e.g. the 1960s counterculture).  And, as such, religion had lost its "aura of transcendence."  A reaction to such  loss of transcendent value had led religion to become increasingly "secule" or "anti religious." The author presents his argument in an intellectual, even academic, tone, which makes it all the more interesting for me.  But, as I said, the ideas are uninteresting.  Even the most ardent of advocates of secularism would find this to be an argument that is, at best, not very convincing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book so much, but sadly it was just too boring.  The characters are shallow, the writing is awkward, the ideas are bad and the theme is confusing.  I mean, who would want to read about a guy who's an alcoholic with a big ego who thinks everything he does is awesome?  I'd rather read about someone who is actually a bad person and a bad friend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried this book for my children's use, and I was so disappointed I had to throw it away.  The stories are terrible and so poorly told that they have to be pulled out of the book to be considered worthwhile, but the writing is so amateurish and poor that it's not clear that they're even intended as narrative.   It's like they were taken from a magazine article.  For example, the story about the young man who gets electrocuted while playing with his electric guitar is so badly written that I had trouble believing it was based on a real incident.  Even the details in this book are so horribly wrong that I'm beginning to wonder if it was written by a five-year-old.  It seems as if the authors simply picked random parts from other children's books and added their own nonsense to make it more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a group of people who are at a party when they all notice a man's penis.  He seems to be getting erections all over the place, and everyone has sex with him and talks about it afterward.  So the narrator and her friends decide that the only way to stop him is to cut off his penis and leave him there to suffer.  They are not sure what they're going to do with it, so they decide to try something drastic.  The story is the narrator's attempt to remember what she did to him at the party.  She writes a letter to the man telling him how it was done, and she also writes about all the people who have come into her life, how they all had something terrible happen to them and now she wants them to be her sacrifice.  This has some fascinating elements, but it's overstuffed and overblown.  A lot of the sex scenes are awkward and awkward, and the prose can get a bit messy.  I also found it hard to follow her attempts to write a letter and remember what happened with the man.  If this book had been written for a younger audience, maybe it would have been less overwrought. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the introduction to his book, Rolfe says that he thinks he's had it with American college textbooks that are simply an extension of the American school system. But when I read a few pages in this book, I can see exactly why Rolf said that.   I found it very condescending to be told that a book written by someone who had been in America's upper crust was worthless and that this was his first attempt at writing a book.  I thought that he didn't have a clue about the country he'd lived in.  A couple of the topics he chose to cover are not even in the English language.  He seems to be making some sort of a point about the English that he learned in his studies, but he doesn't understand the point he's making.  If he were to actually use the words that he used, he might actually have a point.  Unfortunately, he doesn [I'm not sure that this is a very good book. I know that it has been cited by others, and I agree that he made a good case that American education was bad, but I don't think he made many of the points that he thought he was making. He might have gotten a few points out of it had he tried to stick to the topic, but not that many. Also, I think his approach is wrong. He doesn't try to get at the source of the problem, he just tries to take apart the parts that he considers "bad." He writes about the lack of historical context, and the use of euphony in a way that isn't really appropriate, but then uses this lack of context to make the point that Americans shouldn't write books in the first place. He also doesn't really talk about why Americans can't read, and is focused on just giving examples. It's hard for me to say that this book is good when I feel like I can't understand why he's writing this book in the way he's doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book. It makes me believe I should give up reading by the time I hit the mid point. It is not a bad read, but it feels to me that in order for this book to have its "moment" the author had to write a story about a man who is just a little bit in love with a woman he met at a bar. The book starts out as one would imagine a guy would feel before he gets a girlfriend, and it becomes a more complicated love story as the author's protagonist realizes he wants to be with this girl more than anything else in the world. The author does a very good job of capturing what it is like to be a man in the 21st century, especially in a time when we can have a lot of fun, and yet still be responsible and considerate about our decisions. The problem I have with the book is that it comes off as kind of preachy, and I know that the author is trying to be more relatable with her writing, but the way she writes it just makes it feel very preachy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to enjoy this book as much as I can and in a way that I don't have to reread over and over, but after I finished it, I was just so disappointed in it.  First of all, there is no sense of the characters in the novel.  It feels like the author just threw them into a story and got out of it as quickly as he could.  Secondly, there's no sense that any of the main characters actually have any sense of morality.  They're just all selfish and self-centered to the point of being outright evil.  I mean, it's almost like they're living in a fantasy world  or something.  In fact, it reminded me of this old article about how people who have the urge to be heroes have trouble finding the motivation to become one:
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book about an anti-Semitic fanatic and his wife, a Jew who believes in non-violence. When you read about how this man goes about making his wife and family pay for his crimes against non-Jews, you begin to realize just how evil this man is. He is described as a "hating Jew," "stinking of the Holocaust" and a "demented pervert." However, he is a pervert who uses religion to make his wife feel like he's in a love marriage. That's sick! He also describes how he gets the wife pregnant by having intercourse with her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a very expensive waste of money.  It is a biography about a popular American writer and has been widely touted as a major biography. The main issue I had with the book was that it was written to be a best seller and had to be.  There were many factual errors which I had to take care of in my research.  The main author was also interviewed and didn't give his take, but only answered "yes" or "no" when asked what he thought about his book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not bad by any means. The bad part is that it is so completely unoriginal and so full of clichéd characters, that it makes a bad read, not a good one.  I'm actually disappointed that it took me so long to get around to reading it, since I've wanted to read a fantasy about a man who kills dragons and becomes a knight of the Realm for years.  Instead I had to read something else because there's just no way in hell I'm going to finish this crap.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very boring and dull book! This book is all about the problems of American men (including an over-abundance of ugly women) with the women around them, which makes it seem like a book about the men (not really, but close enough for my purposes) who are having problems with women who are not even from their own social class.  I would probably give the book a 1 star rating if not for the fact that it was self-published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked    A Time for War: World War II and the Making of the Modern Age by Michael S. Ruppert, who has written books on the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, and a bunch of other subjects as well.  Unfortunately, A Time For War is nothing but propaganda.   Ruppett is a longtime fan of the Kennedy-administration, especially John F. Kennedy.  Romp is a frequent guest on Glenn Beck's radio show, as well as numerous other programs, and Ruppet has written several books about the Kennedy years.  Despite the claims of Ruppt that he has interviewed a number of key people in the Kennedy administration, no evidence of that is found in his book.  In fact, Ruppent is completely unreliable.  The only person mentioned by name who has the authority to speak for the government is Lee Wanta (Kennedy's ambassador to the USSR), but Ruppant's sources say that Wanta lied.  While Wanta has denied this claim, a source who knew Wanta from the early 1960s says that Wite- tant said that his own personal beliefs are in line with the government's, which makes this claim hard to believe.  According to Ruppaent, "Wanta was very outspoken in the belief that the Kennedy White House was acting as a puppet of the Kremlin.  It was a view that had won him the loyalty of almost all his Soviet counterparts.  Wanta was also convinced that the White House had been infiltrated by spies  who were working for the Kremlin, as one senior CIA official later told the Senate intelligence committee."  Rupet is the only source who makes that statement, but it's hardly convincing, and that claim is made in an earlier chapter, after Wanta's name is mentioned.  Even more telling, Rupit states that he was the only person who spoke to Lee Harvey Oswald, but that's a statement that doesn't seem to be backed up by anything other than the fact that the book includes an interview with Wanta.  And, as we have seen many times in this blog, we don't always have complete knowledge about people.  As I said earlier, Romp, in his interview, states that Witte- tart, as the ambassador to Moscow, was a known Soviet agent.  This is simply not true, and there is no evidence that Winton was anything but a good friend of President
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a big fan of John Grisham. But, after reading this book, I'm not sure I'll be. His writing style is quite poor, his themes are too vague, his conclusions are too obvious (in this case, that "sexual abstinence is the key to a happy and healthy relationship"). He seems to be taking his own advice, not from a reliable source, but from a book that just says "don't have sex." I also think his definition of "happy" is way too broad. He seems very concerned with the idea that someone could be completely satisfied with sex, but I'm more concerned about who could possibly be satisfied by sex. Someone who doesn't want to have sex all the time. Someone with a sexual dysfunction. Someone addicted to pornography. Someone, in other words, who is not satisfied by the very idea of sex. This book, unfortunately, doesn't help with that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I'd had enough of reading about the horrors of American poverty.  But not this time.   The author has done a fine job of describing the conditions in America's urban ghettos, and the hardships, hunger and homelessness, which accompany them.  The story takes a sharp turn when she turns her attention to the food banks, and this turns out to be less than stellar for a book that is supposed to be about the plight of poor people.  In the end, the foodbanks only turn out to have less food than they claimed.  This turns out not to be the end of the story, either.  There are more horrors to come.  I just thought that the food crisis could be used as a launching point for the author to write a more positive story about poor people and the welfare system.  Unfortunately, she goes on to write another book about the hardships of welfare.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book! I felt that the author wanted to make a point about the "good girl" and that the "bad girl" was "bad" because she didn't obey the rules of femininity. The book didn't provide an example to support this and it felt rather forced and made-up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, I was more or less taken to task for my own ignorance about the Bible. As a result, I've taken a long hard look at the Bible, and have found it full of contradictions, inconsistencies, and false teaching.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book so bad it made me cry. I like to read nonfiction, but the title of this one made me think it was a work of fiction (not a bad thing). The story is really interesting and you can't help but want to know more about the woman at the center of it. Unfortunately, the whole thing is really muddled and confusing. I also was a little disappointed that the book is not available in e-book form, so if you want to read it, you'll have to pay for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate books that attempt to "prove" anything about the Bible   This is a bad one.  In the introduction, Mr. B. notes that "In recent years, the Church has been caught up in a long-running controversy concerning the veracity of the Bible. Some of its more literal interpretations have been rejected out of hand, while other interpretations have taken a firm hold on the church."  While it is true that the church has been stuck in a "long-running debate," this debate is between literalists and non-literalists.  Non-litigious interpretations are not only tolerated by the modern church, they are actually celebrated.  In a piece on The New York Times, for example, Michael Gerson declares that "the Bible is full of contradictions, inconsistencies and inerrant narratives, but it's still God's word."  If the church's leaders are not convinced, they can at least say that there are multiple interpretations and that each is correct.  A literalist interpretation would entail that the Bible is inerrrectly and completely true.  It's not.  That's not even close to how the book is actually interpreted.  The only reasonable conclusion is that the entire text must be interpreted out of context and by the standards of the day.  As for the book, I'll admit I didn't like it.  I thought it had the potential to be a good and accurate guidebook, but instead it became a tedious, self-promotional exercise in intellectual gymnastics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst thing I ever read. I loved the first two, but not this one. This book is full of so many errors that I find it laughable. I would have spent the time to correct this stuff. It's just a waste of time, and the author should be ashamed of herself. It really comes off as a piece of trash.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In all honesty, I'm a sucker for good fairy tales. I'm so tired of stories about good guys saving the world from evil, and having the villain go away because he was no match for the hero and everyone he tried to kill. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because it had been recommended to me and I'd heard good things.  This book seemed interesting and I found it a little dry.  While I did find it interesting, I was left wanting more.  In fact, it didn't get me through the entire book and left me more confused than when I began.  I have read other interesting books, but this one is a dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most painful and useless books I have ever read.  The entire premise is flawed, the premise that humans are naturally flawed is flawed.  I don't know about you but I believe I am naturally good and I don't believe that humans ever were.   If they were perfect, we would have evolved past this "disease" of having a "sick" tendency towards perfectionism.  It makes perfect sense that humans, who have been living on earth for millions of years, would have a sick tendency towards trying to become perfect.  But human beings are flawed, flawed in the same ways as all the other animals on this earth.  These flawed humans make perfect forgeries (i.e. people who make up stories or try to be perfect) and the worst of them, the ones that are the most dangerous, are the ones who are most likely to end up doing something to their own body that results in death.  So the only way humans can be safe is if they never try to become that perfect forgery but remain the flawed human that we are.  Because of this flawed nature, I find it hard to believe that people with a "dangerous" tendency to die forgeries are actually dangerous.  They only try to die because they have a dangerous tendency to do so.  That is the only reason they can exist on this planet.  And if you have a "bad" tendency, you're probably better off trying to die (forgery or otherwise) rather than trying to be that perfect.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The cover is misleading, showing three people (including a woman) engaged in sex while two are looking on. It makes the author look like a prude who couldn't get it up when he was a teenager. If you want a quick laugh, go right ahead and buy this book; it won't disappoint. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst thing about this book is that it's based on a real person (not fictional, but not even historical), a 19th century lady, who was a "cult hero" in her day and who people were trying to emulate.  The worst part of this is that in real life, she was a complete charlatan, a con artist, and she never did anything useful for anyone.  In her day, she made her money by selling books full of errors, half truths, and outright fraud.  She was so notorious that when a bookseller in her hometown started collecting her books, he was threatened and eventually killed by her assassins.    I wouldn't mind reading about someone who is completely "pure" if that were a good thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book, but I'm going to be honest about it:  I don't think the author has much skill as a storyteller.  The writing is terrible.  This is the second book in a series that I was so invested in that I had to read through the whole thing in one sitting.  There were a lot of things in this book that I couldn't get out of my head:  How a "savior" of a young girl comes to see that she is wrong in everything she believes in, what it takes to overcome that, how the girl's mother is the one person who does the saving, how her brother also realizes that he's wrong, how it can be both a gift and a curse to change your beliefs, and how her father's death leads her to a life of self-sacrifice and "doing the right thing" at all costs.   And of course, a woman who has never read a book, much less one that she believes is worthy, trying to find one that will be of value.  It doesn't work.  She goes back to her old self, only to find herself still not believing anything.   I guess the author thought that she was "doing something valuable" by reading a book but I couldn the books actually offer anything that I needed to be aware of.   This book was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started this book expecting to be bored by it. Instead, I was blown away. The main character is smart and funny, the plot is interesting and well thought out, the characters are real, and the ending was so satisfying that I couldn't put it down. But I didn't love it. I liked it when it was good and bad, but not both at the same time. So here's my review:  I am not a huge fan of dystopian futures, especially ones where people are so ignorant that they can't even think for themselves. So I'm a bit surprised that a book that is supposed to be about dystopia in the near future actually gives very smart, funny characters the power to rule the world by making rules. In this book, people learn to use computers, and their brains work together in a way that is so effective that they do whatever they want. This makes them more powerful and efficient, and less dependent on their parents. They are able to learn anything that is being taught to them by computers, even if it is so old it can't be taught any more. People's lives are improved, and people's lives improved are improved because of this, so everything is good. The problem with this book is that it doesn't really make any sense. It doesn't explain why the characters in the future are so smart or why computers are so advanced. It gives very little back story. It tries to create a good mood by having characters interact with each other, but it never fully succeeds. I would have appreciated more back story to explain what is going on. I did enjoy it when the characters were good, but the book doesn't help me understand why they are good, and it is more important to give me the feelings I get when I see a good thing happen, than to give the characters more back stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book does a good job of setting up the characters. For starters, it sets up the main character to be a stereotypical 'tough guy' type, and for a while it does a great job of it. But it gets tired pretty quickly. The protagonist is a complete coward and a complete dick. He is a man who spends the whole book hiding from himself. The characters in this book are supposed to be relatable and likeable, but they are nowhere near as relatable or likeable as the main protagonist. He just isn't interesting. I found myself reading the book for fun, not because it was good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book from the moment I picked it up. It's one of the dumbest books I have ever read. The characters are like cardboard cutouts of people who are not only uninteresting but also unrepentant. A woman who was raped and then made to have sex with another man and then raped again. I couldn't stand her at all. The narrator was so smug about it. The woman was so stupid.  I couldn't believe what the narrator was telling me. This woman is totally oblivious. She has no idea what she is doing in her own house. I don't understand how her father ever allowed her to live with him. She goes on at great length about how the husband of one of her co-workers is a horrible person. Why didn't she ever stop him from hitting her in the face? I have never even slapped my own child, and I know that she is lucky that her father was not there. How could he allow that to happen? That's like a woman hitting her husband.    Another friend had a horrible experience with this woman and her son. He was on a business trip and came back to his hotel room and found that her son had come to his room and started to kiss him. He resisted but she eventually gave in. The son was so annoying and annoying. He would never shut up about how much he hated his mother and he hated everyone in the family. The wife was the most disgusting person in the book. The whole situation with her son is so horrible and she just laughed it off when the son made an offhand remark about wanting to see her naked.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very interested in this book, but this is just so poorly written and poorly put together that I had a hard time finishing it. It just felt so   badly written and  poorly put  together  that I couldn't finish reading it, even though I knew the book was bad.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. I thought it was a boring story about two sisters.  I also thought it lacked interesting characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for Christmas but I'm sure it was stolen. It was hard to put down once I started. I think I finished it in one day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many reviews about this book, which is a very good book, but I have a few problems with it. The first problem is that this book is so incredibly wrong that it's almost hard to believe. The second problem is the obvious attempt to turn a negative book into a positive one, which I can appreciate because there are so many things I like about it. Unfortunately, there are a lot of flaws that end up ruining any good feelings it had with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am currently using this book as a textbook for an introduction to computer science. However, this book is absolutely abysmal    As a computer science professor, it is utterly unacceptable for any computer science textbook to deviate so greatly from the standards of excellence that our community expects.   These are the sorts of deviations I would expect from a poorly written newspaper article about a car accident:  1.  This story describes how a young girl was raped by a man twice her age.  If this is true, it demonstrates the extreme dangers of using the Internet for sex.  2.  However, because this is an article about an actual case, it does not discuss the implications of this incident for online child pornography.  These cases are discussed in detail in "The Digital Age: How the New Media are Reshaping Our Lives and Changing the Way We Think About the Future."  3.  The story does not mention the fact that if the Internet had not been developed, the girl would have had to engage in prostitution to have access to the images.  Instead, it treats this as an isolated case.  In fact, the article discusses a similar case in California where the Internet was developed as a replacement for prostitution 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed reading this book very much. It's one of those books that I would enjoy reading just for the characters. I think it's interesting to see how certain people see the world differently, and I thought there was a lot of humor in it. I really liked when one of the characters said "The world's full of liars!"
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to read this book. I read it back in 2011 and was so disappointed. It was one of those books that you can't wait to put down and find a new one - it just doesn't make sense. I understand that books don't have to be 100% perfect.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book: it was written by a respected philosopher whose work I admire. But as usual, the book turns out to be a failure. He spends too much time on the history of philosophy, which is fine, but is hardly the point. The book, for me, is all about the metaphysics and epistemology of mathematics. It doesn't matter whether or not you are a mathematician (if you are, you won't get the joke). This doesn't make it any worse than most of his other work, but it makes it harder to read. The point of philosophy is to make sense of the world, and so is the goal of mathematics, but mathematics is very different from philosophy in that it is a systematic and logical discipline. It is about mathematics, not about philosophy. The problem is that mathematical logic is extremely powerful: it enables us to construct the best arguments to support certain claims (even about the nature of mathematical objects) that are often contrary to our experience. Thus, it can be very powerful in establishing certain kinds of metaphysical claims, including those about reality, existence, and reality itself (like the claim that mathematics is meaningful). In the book, Wittgenstein tries to show that even though the logical relations are not "about" things, we still have a sense of them that is derived from them. It turns out that if this is the case, the logical rules are not necessary to justify our belief in mathematics or the existence of reality. In fact, the existence and "meaning" of reality are not established by the logical laws. If the book had more about the philosophical questions that were raised by mathematics, the whole thing would have been a lot better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book, but as I am reading it, I am thinking 'What is wrong with this kid?' The book was supposed to be a story about a young girl's journey to find her missing sister, but the main character is really a very immature, selfish and obnoxious girl. The book is actually about a girl trying to do something good for someone she thinks she hates. So it's kind of ironic that the heroine is the same way as well. The author seems to be trying very hard to make the book a coming of age story, and her attempts are so bad, that I was forced to throw it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are all stereotypes, not to mention the author.  The main character is very boring, and the other three characters are basically one-dimensional stereotypes.  They're all white men who are married to the same woman, have kids, and don't have much energy or creativity of their own.  Also, the main character has no personality at all -- he is not interesting to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In addition to being the worst novel I have ever read, this is also the worst book I have read that doesn't have a bad moral.  It's just not clear what the author's real purpose was.   She has an overarching thesis (a "philosophy") but it is never explained, and the characterizations seem to be written mainly to make the point that, hey, you can't make moral decisions without good reasons.  If the author wanted to say something true about human nature, I'm sure she could have done it.  But it's very clear that she's not trying to.  So many of the book's other characters, including the protagonist, are bad people because their motivations are bad.  They can't tell good from evil, they have no idea how good their intentions are, and they are too afraid to do something good in the face of a terrible alternative.  That, of course, means they are evil.  This is not an uncommon theme in novels, especially in non-fiction.  And sometimes it's true, and sometimes it isn't.  You have to decide which you believe.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to like this book, but was disappointed, not only because of the author's careless use of the word "turd" in describing a book that has "no value," but also because she gives us no insight into her real-life experience.  It seems to me that she was really only interested in getting her work published, and therefore she made a poor choice of a subject.  That the book has a negative impact on the reader, who cannot even enjoy the final chapters in peace, is unfortunate. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found The World of Ice and Fire  to be a tedious exercise in pointless repetition. The first half of the book is the longest (three chapters) and the most important. That's because that's when we learn about "real world" history, such as the fall of Rome, the fall and subsequent fall of Constantinople, the Fall of Rome itself, the rise of the Church, the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Renaissance, etc. We learn about the political system in which Westeros operates as well as the "real" history of Westeros. The only real history in this book is that of the world of the game itself.    It makes absolutely no sense, and seems to be written by an imbecile with an almost total disregard for the text he is reading.  The plot holes are endless. The characters are mostly the same ones we've met before and are basically indistinguishable from each other, but they're introduced to further the plot in some way or another. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I loved this book, I don't think it's actually a good book in the "real" world. There were a number of things that I found  irritating:  - The use of the word "mockery" when talking about the Christian faith.  As an atheist I have never experienced mockery at the mere mention of religion.  At least in most other religions, the mockers of their religion are derided, and mocked,  and then forced to reform.  The Christian faith does nothing of this sort.  I can think of one example where a Christian was accused of being a "mockingbird" and forced to repent and be a good Christian, but that's about it.   - "The God Who is Not So Much a God as a Thing, a Concept, an Ideology, a Philosophy, a Self-Esteem-Shaming Scheme".  I understand that there are Christians who have developed their own theological systems that are radically different from any other. I was a Christian for many years and while I don 't agree with all of the things they do, I've never seen them condemned for doing them.  For instance, it doesn't matter how many times Jesus tells his followers that they are to give away their stuff and "give to the poor" if he's actually just trying to convince them to do so.  But it's a different matter when Christians get upset about being mocked for their beliefs.  It seems to me that this is a fairly common thing among Christians.  So for them, "the mockery" is when they are called out for not being true Christians in the first place.  This is the same sort of thing that many atheists have to deal with and this really irritates me.  In a way I don' t think the authors have done a very good job of explaining this very simple thing.  Also,  It's hard to get into an argument with someone who uses words like "mocks the God who is not so much a God but a Thing".  And this word is repeated over and over again in the book, sometimes several times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The biggest problem I have with the book is the author's use of the word "vampires." For the sake of clarity and brevity, I'm going to leave it at "vampirism" but the term is almost a universal one, not just for vampires. "Vampiric" is so pervasive in popular culture that the term almost has a stigma attached to it. And yet, if you can't pronounce it, you can probably find a dictionary entry on it. The word is used so often that even a dictionary doesn't have the definition right.  As it stands, the term "vampire" is used for almost everything and everyone.  It is used in movies, television shows, and advertisements.  People don't just want to drink your blood.  They want to be eaten!  It's not just a metaphor for an alcoholic drink.  "Vampire" has become a synonym for "dramatic" or "dreadful."  There are even websites dedicated to the term and selling products that sound just like vampires.  Even a movie called "The Twilight Saga" uses the word frequently.  In a world of so many words, this one has a bad rap. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written for the self-absorbed college student who wants to be taken seriously and who is too lazy to read more than three lines of a chapter.  It doesn't come close to that goal.  The book is filled with platitudes about how it is never too late for things to change and how you should be grateful for what you have.  While it is true that all things change and should change, it is also true that it is NEVER too late to try and change things.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be the students reading this book who are the self absorbed type. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was boring and not really related to the subject at hand. I liked the subject, but the author had to resort to writing boring prose in order to get it across. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have just finished this book.  It's not bad per se, but it's bad.  I'm going to admit right now that it's not worth reading (though it is a quick and easy read), but I really don't feel like I've gotten anything out of it.  A lot of what he's trying to do seems so obviously ill-conceived that it makes me feel really bad about myself for even picking it up.   If I'm supposed to find some sort of message in this book, I don't get it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife and I are going to read "The Art of Love" next. I have read a few of her books but the ones I have are about sex and love. I did enjoy this book but it seems too much like a romance novel to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to start this book. I've been wanting to read about "The Greatest Story Never Told," but I never was able to put down the paperback edition. I was wrong! This book is so wrong. If anyone who is interested in history (and/or the truth about history) is looking for a history book to recommend, this is the worst possible one.  The book opens with the tale of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. The book claims that Joseph Smith and his early followers lied, stole, and betrayed others (and even themselves) in order to make their church look more virtuous. This is not just a simple matter of Joseph being a liar and a thief, but a complex issue with a lot of history in it. It's a classic example of "The Law of unintended consequences": Joseph's followers believed his "prophecies" about a heavenly appearance, but his "seers" were caught and executed for their "transgressions." Joseph's lie that he had found the lost ten tribes of Israel is also a classic instance of "the Law of Unintended Consequences": his followers believed their leader was a prophet and would be able to discover the true God's will for their lives, but Joseph's "lost ten tribes" never showed up. Joseph's deception about his early leaders is also mentioned in the book: Joseph Smith's early followers "were deeply involved in the 'gold bible' fraud. In 1838, Smith's second counselor, Sidney Rigdon, was arrested for forging the Book of Mormon—a fraud that Smith later admitted was a fraud. Rigdon had been a member of the Smith's secret inner circle of the 1820s." The book ends with Joseph's martyrdom and resurrection in 1844. It claims that the restoration of the true church on earth, with Jesus Christ as its leader, was a false church that was condemned by God to suffer and die for eternity. After Smith's martyrdoms, the Book Of Mormon went through many changes, but most importantly Joseph's teachings and teachings became more extreme in order for Joseph to be seen as the "true" church leader. This, according to the author, is the "greatest lie of the 20th century."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are so many poor reviews here, I will just throw out this one. I loved this book. However, there were several parts I really disliked. I found the author's description of her son's personality to be very off. I guess I'm supposed to admire how his father raised him. I really can't. He's really the opposite of his father, I find. In addition, I found it so hard to believe that he's a homosexual. I don't get it. I've read many books about homosexuality. They seem so much more natural to me. I think the author would have been better off simply describing the boy as a gay man. As it is, he's still an immature teenager who has an easy time with girls. I'd love to have seen him fall for a girl, but I don.t think that would have made much of a difference. He probably wouldn't be a homosexual if he had been raised by a normal mother. But, I guess you could always say he's just a kid who's always had a tendency toward deviant behavior. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed the first 100 pages of The World Without Us and was really excited to continue the series. However, I found that after the second 50 pages, I just got bored. While there were some interesting insights, the characterizations became stale after a while, and the story fell flat.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I appreciate this book on the topic of how to be a successful and happy author, I don't see it as a "how to be successful" book. I see it more as a how to survive if you don't succeed.  I'm not an aspiring writer; if I were, I wouldn't read books on how to become a writer.  Instead, I'd read books like Don Draper's memoir (I loved it), The Game by Tom Wolfe (I read it too), or Steve Jobs' biography (I've been meaning to read it ever since his death).  I found that some of the advice in this book is good, but the rest of it is overkill and doesn't help most people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad I had to give up on it after the first chapter.   The book's premise is that "the people in the upper echelons of society were not made this way by their upbringing, but had to work their way up."  Apparently the authors know that this is not true.  They say, "This idea is not new, and it can be traced back to Aristotle in the fifth century B.C.E."  But the authors don't bother quoting Aristotle.  What's more, there is nothing in the book that even hints at how much of a charlatan they think they are.  Why else would people be so angry at themselves when they fail to achieve success in school and work?  Even in their discussion of the history of education, the authors show a total ignorance of how the teaching profession has changed.  "For a long time, teachers were expected to be the saviors of the students and to be seen as the ones in charge of the school."  Not any more.  As they admit, many people now work in the "savior" role.  In this era, there are no more "superior" people, only people doing a good job.  It's no longer about being good at a job, it's about being a good worker, and they know it.  But they're just so stupid, they believe themselves to be better than everyone else.  The idea that people were born bad just isn't true. I wouldn't be surprised to find that the authors themselves had parents who were terrible parents, but they made it to the top in their own right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book based on the rave reviews of the others (most were positive).   This was my first foray into reading YA literature and I was skeptical about some of the more "adult" concepts, such as the lack of sex education in the schools.  I couldn't wait to get into the book and read a few pages.  Instead, I found this book to be a frustrating and confusing slog that I ended up not getting through at all.  The book doesn't give you a real sense of what the characters are going through.  They're all coping with the fallout of the past, but their reactions and reactions to the current situation don't make sense to me.  When their emotions get out of hand they're quick to do something that makes them look like the bad guys, and then when their bad behavior is revealed they turn around and try to blame others for their "bad acts."  There are multiple character deaths but it seems as if they just don't care about any of the characters except for the main character.  Despite the main characters having a history of serious psychological issues, they just can't seem to deal with their problems.  Their past mistakes and failures just make them feel worse and worse about themselves.  YA novels often get away with being overly complicated because the main protagonists are so likable that you can forgive them for any missteps and failures.  But this novel just doesn't work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book, but was not really pleased with it. The first half is full of very boring and predictable prose. In fact, my copy has the cover art of the book, and it's an exact replica of the cover that came in the first edition. If you don't find that to be funny, you probably won't either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for something to read for a laugh, you'll probably enjoy this. However, if you like to look deep into the philosophical underpinnings of our lives, and you also enjoy a good dose of dark humor, you might have a bad time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love books that talk about the bad   But The Catcher in the Rye was not one of them.  It is a great book, but it is so poorly written that I found it absolutely laughable, and totally unnecessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a big fan of genre fiction. I'm also not much of a fan of science fiction. But I did enjoy this book. The characters were interesting, the plot interesting, and the setting interesting. The ending, despite its problems, was still somewhat satisfying. However, the prose was often hard to follow, and I often found myself asking the same questions about characters I thought I'd learned the answer to.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I was going to like this book. Unfortunately, I don't.   It is written in a very academic style, so that it seems like the author really knows what he's talking about.  But the examples are all wrong, and the example for page 598 is ridiculous.  Also, the examples from page 597 are actually quite helpful (I'll use them in my next science book).  And the examples for page 798 are funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was really interesting, but I had a hard time getting through it. It's very difficult for me to accept anything about my culture, or people who share my culture.  It makes me wonder whether or not it's possible for people with a completely different culture to be able to read what I've written, and if they can do that, can they also understand it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author describes a conversation she had with an acquaintance. She asked him why she could never get what she wanted and he replied, "You don't give a fuck what anyone wants."  It just struck me as ridiculous that anyone would say such a thing to her.  I don't want to live in a world where everybody wants the same thing for the same reason, and no one is willing to give up on anything they're pursuing because they think it might get them what they want. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very poor book: too long, repetitive, and the story too poor to be worth reading. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because it's good that the authors tried to make the story more like a novel rather than just a collection of short stories. However, it just ended up falling short of expectations and leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has nothing to do with a real job interview. Instead, the book is designed as a "graphic novel" that consists mostly of interviews of people about how they ended up in the job they are currently in. It is very bad, and the author knows it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited about this book that I bought it in the hopes it would save me from becoming an alcoholic. Instead, it only made me sad.    It is filled with clichéd stories about girls who do the right thing and boys who don't.  No girl (or boy) ever learns anything from their mistake.  I can't believe anyone would make a whole book out of these stories! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book I've been meaning to read.  The theme is interesting enough, but the execution is less than stellar.  It's also hard to know whether the title "A History of the World in Ten Thousand Flavors" is intended to imply that this book is a recipe or a guide for how to make delicious, healthy food.  There is not a single thing in this book that you can put in your mouth to make something that tastes good.  And the recipes that exist are either way too simple or way too complicated for what they purport to be.  I could give this book a star if only because there is one interesting and entertaining chapter devoted to the history of chocolate.  Otherwise, it's pretty bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is just awful   As bad as it is, I think it is a good book to keep an eye on as it comes out in a new edition of its predecessors.  I can't help but wonder what is going to happen to a society with so many people who think like this.  In the meantime, it makes me wish that I had not given in to their message.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed with this book. It was written to give the illusion of "balance" in a fantasy world where evil often seems almost inevitable. Yet I found it so lacking in that regard that I simply skipped ahead to the next book without reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book that tells the story of the worst airline disaster in history (the 1989 crash of TWA Flight 800) in a way that is both simplistic and misleading.   The book is narrated in the first person by one of the passengers who died.  The narrator uses this person's tragic story to make his case against privatizing the airline industry.  Unfortunately, the narrator's description of the event is so inaccurate that it is difficult to believe that it happened at all.  After all, the plane flew off course, missed a runway, crashed into the ocean, and caught fire.  It sounds like a textbook airplane accident, but it was not.  Instead, it was a catastrophic failure in the management of the company's safety record. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very surprised when this book was published. It is a collection of essays by a group of intellectuals, but it is not very interesting, and not much of anything of value is revealed.  These essays have little to do with anything the authors have written before, and they do not explain much of what is really important about what they think is important, such as the need for the individual to think, to create, to experiment, to find himself, and to explore. This is interesting, but not essential, especially to people like me who think little of learning about anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. I had a difficult time picking this book up, because I had previously been so impressed with The Power of Now and had been expecting it to be the same. When I finished reading this book, I was completely disappointed, even though I had found much to like about it in other reviews. I also found it hard to believe that one of my favourite self-help authors would not have written a good book about depression, considering that she was the one who helped me overcome depression.   I am not sure that this is even her area of expertise, as she has never written about depression in her books. I am sad that I will never get to read her wonderful book, even if I don't feel like reading a book about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book expecting to like it and liked it somewhat.   The book is mostly about his experiences with the "Buffy" TV show, although he discusses other characters.  The most interesting part of the book, which I found quite funny, was a discussion about the origin of the term "fangirl."  He said that the word comes from the fact that, "in movies, TV shows and books, characters who identify with the main characters' adventures are called fangirls."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book.  I was looking forward to reading it while I waited for my college coursework to finish.  Unfortunately, I found it disappointing.  A few of the chapters were rather dull.  There was not much of an analysis of the problems of our economy.  The central theme was how we had made a bad decision in 2008.   But the author seemed to have little real understanding of the underlying problem, in terms of banking policy.  This is not surprising.  Our current situation is not new.  It has been a long time coming.  When I was in graduate school, we were taught about the importance of the gold standard, as well as the problems with the Federal Reserve.  These were problems that had plagued our country since its founding.  But these problems had been hidden from view, until the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made a series of bad decisions in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Until then, it had been the role of central banks to fix problems in the private banking system.  In the years since, the FOMC has tried to fix these problems, but it hasn't been successful.  While it can make promises about future policies, it has made many promises about what it won't do, and these promises often come to nothing.  Without knowing the underlying causes of our problems, the public and the government have lost confidence in the F.O.M.C.'s ability to fix them.  To be clear, the reasons for this decline in trust are not purely economic.  For the most part, the problems we are experiencing are structural in nature, caused by government intervention in the economy, and therefore cannot be fixed through economic policy alone.  What makes the current situation so hard to overcome is the fact that the problems have been allowed to fester for so long.  If the Fomc had issued strong, clear-cut policy prescriptions after the crisis, then it would have had an even easier time getting our finances back in order.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really care for this book, at least in the early part of the book, but I gave it a chance because it was written by a friend and I have a lot of friends that I like very much. The book starts off quite well:  "In the early years of her marriage, when he was just an undergraduate, his friend had told her of a young man he had recently met and fallen in love with. She said the man was beautiful and charming. In fact, he was a beautiful boy."   This description really struck me as I remember the first time I met my future husband. My boyfriend, Paul, is a nice enough guy and he is actually pretty hot, but he is also a bit of a nerd, which made our first date kind of hard.  Unfortunately, I had the misfortune of marrying a guy with an IQ of 135. He was also obsessed with a young girl, who was about five years younger than him. The girl lived with her father in a large Victorian home and her father was also Paul's father's best friend. I had to work to help pay for Paul's education, so my mother told me that Paul had to take this girl to summer camp. I was furious at Paul because, even though he didn't have to, he wanted to spend money like everyone else. He got in a big fight with Paul about it and Paul had him arrested.  As luck would have it, the girl had to go to a family funeral the following weekend so Paul spent the next few days with me, the only person he could actually talk to about it. That's when I learned that I was dating Paul's future wife.  Paul's story is interesting, but it doesn't make for a very interesting book. It's written really well, but the subject matter is a little too dry. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to throw out the book I bought from the library because I found so many errors that it was clear that the book had been written by someone with little knowledge of how a computer works.   This is the kind of book that a person who is illiterate would pick up and begin reading and not realize the errors until they got to the end.  I have read more than one book that looked great on the inside and on the outside, but inside was filled with errors that made the content incomprehensible.  Even the cover art looked bad because of errors like the title.  The book is only valuable to the person who buys it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete disaster. The plot is really bad; the characters are despicable; the whole story reads like it was written by a 12-year-old; and I found myself constantly wanting to throw the book against the wall to make a point.  I understand that this is an autobiographical account written by one man in the 1970s, but it's just too hard to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole book is a compilation of terrible and very bad things about modern society.  Some of these things are really common sense - there are no better ways to raise a family, to make a living, and to have fun than being part of an extended family or working in a close-knit job.  I'm in the business, and I can tell you that some of the problems in this book are very common.  The only way to fix them is to change the way people are raised.  That means we have to get back to the days where parents and children were close.   This book is full of myths and superstition about child rearing, and it's easy to see why people cling to these outdated ideas.  Maybe we can get away with them because so many of us grew up with them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a classic example of the genre "science fiction in prose," the genre in which a writer writes about an event and has the result interpreted as a scientific advance. For instance, the book's title is about the first nuclear-powered submarine. It starts out as a joke, but the "science" behind nuclear power has a profound effect on real-world naval history. What makes the joke funny is that the real-life submarine never reached the top of the sea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It has too many problems to be good, which means that it will be useless.  There is not enough content, not enough style, too much repetitiveness, the writing is not well written, and the author's grammar is so bad that it's embarrassing to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book, as I have enjoyed all her books. However, there are many aspects of the book that I found not so convincing.  The author often portrays women as "strong" and in control of their lives; however, as a woman, I was never quite able to maintain that control.  In one chapter, the author describes her feelings about her marriage and discusses the difficulties her husband has with his new job as well as his work ethic; but all too often, she makes these observations about her husband seem like an overreaction.   The fact that she was "not a woman's woman" and that her husband "had to fight to keep her alive" and her "selfish behavior" is not something that strikes me as particularly interesting.  I also had problems with the character of "Tania" (a character that is supposed to represent the "average" woman).  She is presented as "nice and calm" and "not as much trouble" as other women.  However, I found her behavior to be very inconsistent.  Often, she is presented with little-to-no credit, for example, and yet is able to obtain what she wants or need through violence or trickery.  This is not what a "nice" or "well-balanced" woman is supposed be like, especially in the era of the 80s.  It is also hard to believe that Tania was not at least a part of the "bunch" of women that "played house" at night and abused the children.  At the end of the day, however, it was just too hard for me to take these female characters seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favorite book ever. I will read all of his books from now on. I hope the end comes fast with his next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first started reading this book I was shocked to learn that it had been translated from French and was published in a language that I didn't recognize. I found the writing to be poor and repetitive, and the tone condescending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, I am so glad that I purchased and read this book. I was so frustrated about how hard it is for me to read fiction. It is so easy for me and my Kindle to read other people's novels. So my expectations were so high, I was SO disappointed in this one!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I've ever read!  It's written in such a self-absorbed and pompous manner that it makes it difficult for me to engage with the characters.  The tone of the author is just too condescending, and the writing style is just plain uninspired.   I have no interest in being a part of someone else's "success" or being praised for "creative writing".  As I have said before, I write for myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book. I found it very tedious, boring, and repetitive. The prose is extremely terse, as if it's being used to make the author's points in a fast-paced way. I don't know if it works that way or if it was just the author trying to put an air of authority around something he didn't really believe in. It felt as if he was just reading a book he found interesting and didn't want to waste his time on. I ended up dropping it because I found myself wanting to continue reading it, and I found the book to be a bad read all the way through.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book, but couldn't finish it. The characters were annoying and I couldn't sympathize with them at all. The plot was a mess and never came together. I didn't care if the hero saved the world, but I was so busy wishing he would have died in the first place that I lost interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As an avid book-reader who enjoyed a book like The Good Lord Bird and thought it was excellent, I was surprised by this one.  The story is not interesting; the characters are bland; the writing is stiff; and the characters' motivations are contrived.  For instance, there's a scene near the beginning in which a character describes the sight of a woman being strangled by her husband, and how her husband's actions led to the murder. The wife goes on to describe how he strangled her during sex.  To me, that's interesting, but not in the context of the story.  There are also a few other contrived scenes, such as the wife describing the smell of blood at a murder scene.  But overall, this book isn't bad.  It's a good read for people who like good mystery novels.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be absolutely worthless, but at least I didn't waste money on it. I was hoping to find a book I could recommend to other people as a source for information about a serious disease that affects men. Instead, I was left with a headache and a sense of hopelessness and futility that I hope to never encounter in my lifetime.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was hard to follow this book. I found myself lost while trying to follow the main character and his search for his long lost twin brother.    My brother was an alcoholic, and my parents tried to help him, but their efforts came to nothing.  His alcoholism seemed to have gone into remission after he met a woman who reminded him of his twin brother, so I was surprised when the twins vanished.  I was also confused as to why the narrator kept claiming that the two twins were still together.  It didn't make sense to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book at work with two co-workers. We were both very disappointed with the book. We both thought the book was a flop and that the authors should write something else. They don't seem to understand that there's a lot of money to be made on this topic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a really awful book. In the second half, I became increasingly depressed, and when I was finally able to finish it I was devastated.  I was so unengaged with the novel, and I felt like I was reading a bad porn film.  A guy goes on a trip with a girl, who's from his hometown. He ends up in a bar with a bunch of other people and she has a threesome with them.  He's not interested.  She says that he needs to be more involved with her, but he can't deal with it.  And then, in the middle of this bar crawl, he gets a phone call from his girlfriend.  The guy who's in the threeway with her is in jail.  (I know it's supposed to be some sort of comic plot, but it wasn't.)  I found this extremely sad.  It's all so  stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While it may be true that one person's bad book is another person's good one, I found this to be an awful book.  It's just badly written.   There are just so many details that the author couldn't even remember, even though he had been in the military for 30 years.  There were several times when he simply couldn't understand how something could have happened that wasn't an actual military action.  The whole story is just so silly and inconsistent that the book would be better served as a collection of humorous anecdotes and photos.  I mean, I'm sure that if I had done this book as a kid I wouldn't have remembered anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not very interesting, and it didn't help that it was written by a former member of the LDS Church who claimed that Joseph Smith was a fraud. There were lots of questions that were raised that didn't get answered. I think there would have been more interest in the story if it had been written by someone with an interest in Mormon history and/or science. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I finished reading this book because I was reading about a new study suggesting that the most valuable thing in life is the ability to learn, and it made me curious to see if I'd ever learn how to fly.  It was a great idea and I wanted to read more about it, but    It's a bad premise, with no evidence whatsoever that learning to fly will improve your life.   The authors try to sell it by citing the fact that many famous people have learned to fly and that it's a common accomplishment for those who have lived in very poor or dangerous environments.  But when I tried to do that, I didn't make it past the first paragraph.  There is no evidence that it is common, or that it will have any long-term benefit for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a lifelong reader of books written by women. In the course of researching her books, I discovered that one of them was the very first book to feature the writing and experience of an African American female journalist. That struck me as ironic, as the author was a white female writer, who in her book described how she, too, was ostracized by male colleagues because of her gender. I did not find that ironic. I found the ostracism and rejection of a female journalist, by her own peers, to be so sad and pathetic, I had to put down the book, just to let the reader know that that was the sad reality for her. This book is one of the most depressing and pathetic books I have ever read. I find myself wanting to throw it down the stairs as soon as I finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was reading this book and I just couldn't put it down, but I couldn't go into the other chapters and continue reading it until I was done.  I can't believe that anyone would read this book, but my friends and I both loved it and we both felt we could do without reading any more.  My two biggest gripes were that the main character was so boring, and that she and her husband are so selfish about their marriage.  The husband always seems to take the initiative, while his wife always wants to wait on him.  But I suppose that's just his personality.  Overall, I liked it and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good, entertaining, and informative book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because it was advertised as being about "emotional intelligence."  While it does describe some skills that may be useful in learning how to manage your emotions, these skills are hardly taught in high school, and they seem to be based on the idea that our emotional states are a reflection of our intelligence.  (I'm a cognitive psychologist and I'm not sure that's how intelligence works at all.)  But I digress.  The book's subtitle is "The power of emotional intelligence." But the title makes it sound like something that could only be learned by studying an elite group of people, and that's a pretty limited description.  While I appreciate the idea of learning how not to be too sensitive or overly emotional, I don't think the book makes a strong case that emotional intelligence is any easier to develop than a person's other abilities.  Instead, the book spends too much time describing how people with high emotional intelligence can't understand the negative reactions they get from others.  I think emotional intelligence applies to anyone, even the most emotionally sensitive people.  But the book doesn't really make that case, either, so I gave up hoping that the book's title would lead me to a better understanding of what I actually learned from the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a big fan of David Sedaris, and it seems like this book was originally written for him, but I can't say that I'd find it very appealing. It's very silly, and the characters are just so contrived that you don't care about anything they say. It doesn't help that the character that really steals the show is named Gilderoy Lockhart. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. It was a wonderful and informative exploration of the human side of our animal brothers and sisters. However, I found the final chapter to be a bit of a disappointment. The animals were portrayed as "selfish, cruel, greedy, greedy little brats" (something that's pretty well-known in the animal world). There was also some suggestion that people were bad animals and "were so cruel to each other and to animals, that they even made the earth into a torture chamber for some poor little animals that they were so mean to." I don't think this is a valid take on the world of animals. People are just as much animals as animals are to us. As someone once said, "Animals can feel the warmth of another animal's face, even when it's in the dead of night, and can even tell you when they're about to get sick. And they can be frightened of something even as much as we can be."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just a bad bad book.   It's so bad, and so poorly written, it's a wonder any of the characters survive.  It doesn't help that the author starts out her book by writing that the "soul" of a person is "haunted by the soul of their mother," which of course is just plain wrong.  Then, later in the book, the author adds, "I think of the soul as being composed of a couple of parts, the intellectual and emotional parts of a human being."  I'm sure that's true, but then the intellectual part of the human being is also responsible for making decisions and for making choices. So, the book is actually a series of badly-reasoned conclusions based on a single fact that is a lie.  But this is just too much to swallow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed reading this book. I was very impressed with how well she explains the science behind evolution and why humans and animals are not related. However, the book became very preachy at times and the author's conclusions are not well supported by the scientific literature.  This book may be good for the science-fiction fans, but not so much for the other readers of this book: it becomes very preach and does not take into account the limitations of our current understanding of biology.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not very impressed by this book.  As a writer, I find the word "enchantment" to be the best possible word for this book to describe.  I had no problem with the story but I found it to be so overblown that I couldn't stand to finish the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked the first half of this book. It was written by an excellent journalist, and while she does not cover the details of the case in great detail, she does get some things right and a few things wrong. The problem with the second half of the book is that it is written by a lawyer, and the lawyer is very bad at writing. Her style is condescending and patronizing, and it's so apparent throughout the book that she does NOT represent the victim, but is simply doing her job by trying to help her client. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son read this book back in 2008, and had the same problems I did: "The book is poorly written, it's poorly written for the reason that the writer cannot come up with an original idea" I can tell that my son was right.   It takes place in a city that is supposed to be about the "real" New York (the original New York).  The city is presented as having "gone through many changes" and "changed from an old to a new kind of society" (the description of "a new kind" is just as vague as it was when I read the book).  Instead of "New York City" being the city, it is the "city of New York" and the "newer" part is just part of the older part.  The original New Yorkers are either dead or in hiding.  If anyone has ever lived in "the city of New Yorkers," there is nothing about it that resembles the real city.  But then again, neither is "the original city" from "The Hunger Games." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a piece of fiction.  It is so bad that I did not even bother to finish it.  In fact, I just threw it out.   It was so poor that I do not think that the author has read any literature.  The characters are stupid, the plot is poorly done, and the language is terrible.  I am not sure if it is the author's fault or if the people she wrote the book about are stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book.   The characters, as far as I can tell, don't know they're characters.  They go on adventures and talk about their adventures.  There's a good deal of dialogue about how silly some of these stories are.  I just can't get behind the stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts with the idea that our brains are hardwired for the acquisition of knowledge:  This is certainly an idea that has some merit, but I don't think it's all that plausible.  The argument that we develop the capacity for learning through practice is an argument that is much more persuasive:  I don;t have the ability to sit down and do a thousand pull-ups in a row  But I do.  In fact, I did it the day before writing this review, with a few other pull-up attempts.  I still haven't gotten the hang of it yet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has lots of good ideas, but it's all wrapped in an uninspiring malaise. I didn't find much of a plot: most of the characters appear in the middle of the book, and by the time they're relevant (or at least interesting) I'd lost interest. Also, I found it hard to follow. At one point, a character makes a really good point about why some women are really bad drivers, but after that I couldn't follow it very well. At some points I had to stop the book in order to keep track of all the important details I had missed. That's one of the things I love about books: you don't have to memorize everything; you just need to remember what's going on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an avid reader, but this book did not engage me. I can tell you this book is well researched and very well written, but I just did not feel I connected with the main characters enough to make it worthwhile.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know about you, but I was quite impressed with this book. I was so drawn to the character of Cate, the young girl who was being raped by her mother, that I was unable to put it down for the entire day.  She was a fascinating, vulnerable, and compelling character.  Her life, her circumstances, and the man who was controlling her were so well presented that I wanted to be Cate herself.  It seemed to me that the author did everything in her power to make her seem real and believable.  There was so much to like about her, and even her mother seemed to be trying her hardest to protect her from the worst aspects of the world, even as she could not be responsible for it herself. But then came the awful parts.  Cate's rapist was portrayed as a gentle, thoughtful and responsible man.  He had given her a necklace that he was wearing when he assaulted her.  I thought that was incredibly insensitive, and as a result, I felt more strongly about my own experiences as a young female than I had since I was a child.  When it was revealed that his actual motive was to have sex with her because of his interest in older women, I also felt extremely uncomfortable, especially when she found out what his motive was.  And then when her mother was killed in front of her, it was all over.  Even as the author pointed out that Cate was a young girl, and that her mother's life and death should not be associated with Cate in a negative way, I found myself wondering how I felt about her having been raped by a man I trusted so much, and who I had no reason to think would commit such a heinous act against a small child.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to find a good book about an unpopular topic. The author talks about his interest in homosexuality in great detail and shows that it isn't "perversion" (or anything that would be called such nowadays), but simply a different sexual orientation. It's a pretty brave move. He has to defend himself against his colleagues in the academic world who, for various reasons, don't understand his passion for the subject. The whole book is interesting and worth reading. However, I couldn't get through the last paragraph without crying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to be a companion piece to the excellent "Eating Animals," but while "Eggs" is a better read than "Animals," it doesn't compare to "Animations." In "Animating," you are exposed to a variety of animals, from the bumblebee to the penguin, from an elephant to a polar bear, and you learn about their lives in all their different states of life. In "Eats," by contrast, you get a very basic primer on how to cook eggs, how to prepare the eggs from the shells, how do you peel an egg without cutting it and how do eggs look when they have been cooked and hard cooked. I know this is not because "Eales" was not a good cook, but because his eggs are so basic. I had to do a quick Google search to find recipes for his eggs. So in a sense, he is teaching you about food, but not about food that you eat regularly and are eager to prepare yourself. This is a shame because I would love to see how others cooked eggs in the wild.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a disappointment. It's so bad that I have to wonder if the author realized that a book can't really be that bad. The ending is lame, the characters are one-dimensional, and the whole thing is made entirely of cliches and cliched characters. I'm trying to think of other books where the main character's only flaw is that she has a terrible personality.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book a lot. But it has so many shortcomings that I can't recommend it to anyone. The main one is that I couldn't understand the author's motivation for making the book what it is. She repeatedly makes statements about how her son needs to learn to cook and to be more self-sufficient. But at the same time, she constantly mentions how much her son loves cooking. She also says that the kids are "too good for this," even though her own children are far from that. Finally, I found it strange that she repeatedly says that her son has been doing this for years when his father would never have believed that, because the father has never been interested in his daughter learning to cook or to be self-sufficiency. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book expecting a positive review: I was so sure I was going to like it! I didn't! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to read this book but I just couldn't put down the book. The prose was so perfect and the plot was so good. I loved the book from the first chapter, but found the end disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's first book on the Bible was a complete and total bust.  The subject matter was too abstruse and too poorly researched for a book that had to be published in 1993.  Her second book on biblical Hebrew and Greek, however, was more popular.  In this book she has tried again to make biblical Greek and Hebrew intelligible.  It is a huge effort, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've heard a lot of bad reviews about this book, but in all honesty I just couldn't see myself reading it. The writing was slow, the story was incoherent, and the characters were all bland. In fact, I just found myself getting bored in the middle of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very bad book.  It contains many errors and the grammar and spelling is poor.  They have even copied the sentence structure from the previous book.   It is one of those books that has a lot of info but is poorly written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If the author had been a bit more careful with the historical facts (as well as the details on the characters) she might not have created a character so flawed.  The author's real point is that there is no point in talking about anything but how the characters behave.  That is an awfully self-referential and self-important opinion, and a poor one at that.  I would much rather be interested in characters who think and act, and not in how they behave.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit that I was not as excited about this one as I was about the first three books in the series.  The third book seemed so out of place at the end of the first 3 that I felt like I needed to finish this one off before I could really finish the others.  Still, it was a worthwhile read.  As usual, the story is good.  But it's the characters that make it good.   I'm glad that these two are still together but I think it's probably for the best that they split up because the characters are so cliched.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this to be rather tedious, and if this is the only work I've ever read by the author, I'll say it's probably a bad idea.  This is a sort of "revised" version of a previously published book on The Satanic Bible, which the author claims to have revised but which contains the same material as the original.  It begins by showing that all the material in The Satanic Verses has been available for years and never seems to have had much of an impact.  A reader could probably find even the "revisionist" version in print somewhere.  The material in question appears only twice in The Bible.  The first time is in verses 17-20:  [The Prophet] said to them, "You will go into all the nations and they will say, 'How did the Lord live during his life on the earth? How did the wicked person live in the land of Egypt?' But you will say in reply, 'The Lord lived in the wilderness.' "That's an interesting story, the only thing missing is the part about the evil person's getting naked in the desert.  In any event, there is some interesting information in there, but the main thrust is the same as the version in The Book of Mormon:  The Prophet declared: "I tell you the truth, there was never a nation or kingdom that was destroyed by a flood or earthquake or fire or by any other kind of calamity. And there will never be a nation, nor kingdom, nor language, that will be destroyed by fire, or by the sword, or a famine or by pestilence. They will all be burned up and dissolved in the earth, and there will be no place for them on the face of the whole earth."  This seems to be the source for all the references to "the wrath of God" in the Book of Revelations (which is, of course, a major inspiration for The Satanic Scriptures).  It's one thing for a non-Christian to claim that there's a good reason to believe that some prophecies are meant to be fulfilled by some of the things that have already happened.  I'm all for it!  But when the person who is claiming to be correcting something says that it will never happen is not only wrong, it's a bad argument! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book.  It was well-written, but had some serious flaws.  First of all, the characters are the worst.  For example, a character calls me "sweetie" and I immediately reply, "Please call me 'Honey'  Please!  There's no need for the word'sweetie'  It's too offensive!  Also, a female character who is a professional author is referred to as "sweetheart" and it drives me crazy!  The only way I could ever like her is if she was some sort of pervert.  She's really  ridiculous  I guess I could have accepted her if she were in a situation like that.  Lastly, I found the "dying in the woods" story to be ridiculous.  I'm just waiting for someone to write a good mystery.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a total waste of time. It's filled with nothing but lies, half-truths, and historical inaccuracies.  It is filled with historical details that have been debunked time and time again, and many of the quotes in it are out-of-date.  Even the author makes things up as he goes along.  This book should be a warning to anyone who takes any history or education classes, to stop wasting time and money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited about this book I bought the first edition for my Kindle.  Unfortunately, it was not the same book, although it was mostly the same writing style.  The last part of the book was a series of essays from various people, mostly women, about their relationships with their mothers.  It was the last part that I hated because it was all about how women's mothers were not good for them.  They were "unfit" to be mothers, and they were "bad" mothers in ways that made their children "bad."  They should have gotten over their bad experiences and been happy with themselves.  That's the whole book in a nutshell.  I have always thought that mothering was a great experience that people get over so easily.  This book doesn't say that.  In the end, it's still about women's mothering experiences and not so much about how to be a good parent.  My guess is that some of the writers who participated in the book were too "damaged" by their bad experience with their mother to be able to write a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book seems to be written for a high-school audience with a focus on sexual promiscuity as a path to success.  The idea that promiscuous people are good is not supported by the evidence.  It is not a problem with promiscous individuals as a class, but it is a problem of the individual promiscuites.  Some of the examples used to illustrate the points are bad examples.  This kind of book is used to persuade people to "be themselves" rather than having to adhere to social conventions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book and found the author's analysis of the way in which religion, religion and religion have played a part in the world's    problems  problematic   extremely   poor. I  liked a few of her suggestions for improvement. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read other reviews where the narrator talks about how difficult it is to read this book and I really appreciate her take on how difficult reading it is. I agree that it's difficult to get into the character's head but that's because the book is so self-serving and self-righteous. I also think it would have been better if she had given more detail about how the characters had fallen for one another in the past. I have heard horror stories about people falling for another person in the first 30 minutes of dating and this book has that problem in spades. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For some reason, this book does not have a "Good" or "Worth Reading" label.  This is a poor "journal entry" book, that goes out of its way to make you feel sorry for the author.  It is full of anecdotes about bad experiences with people and is written like a newspaper clipping about a tragic event.  The book is written as a sort of "memoir" and I don't want to read a bad "memories" book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a science fiction and fantasy reader who found this book boring. The story is about an alien who lives in the human world and a scientist who thinks he knows how to send messages back. They are supposed to be sent to the moon, but the alien dies on the moon. They travel back in time and try to contact the aliens so they can take him back. No good can come of that. They never find the aliens. What happens on the way back is not really interesting either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book at a time when I had very little interest in books that revolved around religion, especially Christian religion.  I didn't think I needed any of that, but this book has become an object of fascination for me.  The first chapter is a good primer on what is meant by "religion" in the context of modern American life.  Then the next three chapters deal with specific aspects of that modernity.  As far as the first part of the book is concerned, I think that it was all good.  It is a fascinating examination of what people mean by the phrase "religions" and why people do the things they do.  At the end of the day, however, I just can't recommend this book as anything but a curiosity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished this book after a week of intense mental torture. It was all going so well and I thought I was getting somewhere but the last 40 pages were all about what is wrong with modern society. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in late 2006. As a college student, I enjoyed it very much. At the time, the author had a new best-selling book, The Well of Loneliness. In that book, he described how his wife had died of a disease unrelated to her depression, and how his family had tried to figure out why she had been depressed. In the book, the patient described how the "sick" person is always trying to be happy, and the patient always reacts angrily and with a sense of superiority. I was curious to see if the author would make a similar suggestion about depression and self-esteem. I found the book to be somewhat repetitive in some areas (it has the same format over and over), and I found a lot of the self-assessment questions to be pointless. I guess it would be more accurate to say that the patient's negative view of her life and self is the self. There is no sense of a happy relationship. As far as the actual "treatment," it appears that most of the "cures" involve more time spent in a nursing home and more medications. In a nutshell, this book will not be recommended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you've read this book, you will know the rest of the plot by the end.   It's very predictable and cliched.  The narrator makes it seem like everything he says is true, yet the book spends a great deal of time showing how the narrator is either wrong or lying about things.  His attitude toward religion is condescending and judgmental.  He refers to people who are "anti-intellectual" as "anti intellectual."  The book includes a section about how a writer is supposed to be a "purer voice" and the narrator seems to be doing the opposite.  This is one of the worst examples I've ever read of "purity."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A typical YA romance book, with the heroine being the only one who is sane, well, in most of the books.  There are plenty of "fangs" thrown in for good measure, but it doesn't help that the only rational person in the book is the heroine.  Unfortunately, I was able to guess the villain and he was a total wanker, so we never really learn what he really wants and does, and it isn't very fun to figure out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There were just too many errors, omissions, and other defects to take seriously any of the content, which is to say that it's just plain bad.   The first 100 pages or so are largely a mix of historical and literary allusions that have no apparent connection to the book's topic, which boils down to a bunch of meaningless historical bloopers, as though it were just an excuse to put in a few funny faces.  After that, we're back to the historical blunders.  That's not to say it's bad in itself.  It's just not that interesting.  I'm not sure why it was ever published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just read this book in the late 1980s.   It was the first time I heard of this work.  This book describes a society in which women's equality was almost complete.  These women, however, were not equal to men in all ways.  There was still plenty of abuse from women to men and boys,  and still some of those abuses are far worse than the abuses suffered by men.  One of the main reasons women are given such a hard time was that men still have sex with women's bodies.  Yes, we live in a patriarchal society, but we live differently, and we have more than our fair share of abuses.  If anything, this book is just another example of the way we want to pretend things are the same as they were when they were not.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a teenager I was reading this book. As I got through it I was surprised to find that the main character was only 5 at the start of the book, and was not in his teenage years at all, instead having been in his late 20's by the end.  While I was amused that he was a 5 year old boy in his twenties, I had a lot of problems with it.  As I tried to make sense of this, I realized it was just a gimmick.  But, if a guy from the 90's is still young enough to be a 5, how can this have happened in modern times?  I didn't understand why it took place in the 90s at all.  And the reason for him being a 5?  Wasn't he a teenage boy who had died and come back to life?  Also, he was the only one who knew how to drive, so he'd never even seen another car.  I know they had some weird science fiction thing going on here, but it wasn't realistic at all.  It's like they threw in a magic potion or something, and then when the magic was over they were left with a kid who couldn't drive any more, a teenager who couldn' t do anything right, and a dead 5 year boy.  If they had stuck with the story, the other characters would have found some reason to forgive and forget him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed by this book, not because it wasn't good, but because of the way it was written and the way in which it was presented.  The authors don't want to be called "the best" or "the worst," so they write in such a way that makes it seem that there are only two choices:  "There are many great novels out there."  Or "There is no such thing as the best novel."  They present a selection of books that are good, some that are bad, and conclude that "There really is no great novel." (Well, there is some great work out there, but the authors don t make the effort to discover it, and they do this by presenting "good" work in an entirely misleading manner.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like the book. The characters are so unlikable that it hurts my stomach to know that some people would have the audacity to call themselves "mature" enough to read this book. I also feel that the book reads like a fanfic. There is no depth or development, only cliches. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've had many bad reads in my life, and this one is in the top 5:  It seems like the author's main thesis is that the world is a terrible, dangerous place, and every single problem is caused by evil people who don't want to change. The story follows a group of kids who spend most of their time hanging out together. I found this a tedious and pointless endeavor. The characters all have problems. Some of them are easy to solve, but others are harder to overcome. The author never gives any examples of these problems, and never demonstrates that they're possible to solve or that there's anything wrong with them at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very poor book about a very bad book.  The first person narrator is a terrible and arrogant writer.  He uses poor writing style in his "reviews" of many other books.  I'm not sure why he writes as he does.  His writing style seems to be "a bit like a teenage boy".  The stories are very badly written and the characters are not very likable either.  They sound and act the same.  There are a few good points but the book is very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was terrible. It was a rehash of many of the same myths from other books I've read, and it lacked a good story line, and the writing was terribly stilted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read several books about Mormonism    but the ones that I liked the most were the first ones I read.   This one was not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not an entertaining book at all, but I have a feeling that it will have some good parts, and that the bad parts are more likely to be the ones that will stay with you the longest.  It's a really weird book, in that it takes a bunch of really boring stuff and puts it in the context of a group of weird, strange people.  I'm not really sure I like the way he describes a girl's vagina or her boyfriend's penis.   It reads like it was drawn by a stoned 13 year-old. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to help my struggling English and I was not disappointed at all. She is not afraid to go against the grain of conventional wisdom. She goes against everything that we are taught as a society - that God loves everyone and that love can come in many forms. The author does a great job of showing how love can transcend what many people think about love and how we can be a true reflection of God. Although there is a lot of preaching and talking about sin and how to be perfect in your life, the author shows how love and kindness can change the hearts and minds of those who feel they cannot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot, as well as the characters are awful.  The way they are presented is so over the top it seems like they're talking straight out of an action movie.  They're in a dark room, trying to sneak into a secret CIA base, but no one bothers to check if they have the right ID.  In addition, they have to be a certain age before they're able to enter the base, which has nothing to do with the plot but more to do for show.  Even the secret base itself is ridiculous.  It's a mansion that was created by the government, who has to turn it into a mansion if they want to stay in power.  No one bothers with anything else.  As if the CIA could find a house in the middle of the desert and make it perfect.  Not sure what the point of it all is, other than to make the characters look like assholes.  That's the only reason they have any credibility, because nobody is able to read between the lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the first four chapters and have now lost interest.  If I did ever read the book, I would be disappointed.  The author describes what it's like to be the victim of a bad breakup.  It sounds so sad, but I doubt it will be much fun for the characters.  In the book she also talks about the bad things other people say about a person who has been dumped -- and that seems like something a friend would say about his or her ex. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book, thinking it was going to be a wonderful study of the science and ethics of cloning.  It's just not very interesting.  The book starts out well enough, but by the time the story reaches its dramatic conclusion (which is really kind of sad), it becomes obvious that the author has lost all interest in the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not teach how to live a fulfilling life, and does not help in making friends, much less get a girlfriend. The author has never had a girlfriend, and she admits that the very fact that she is trying to get a girl's attention is an indicator that she's failing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit that I was really excited about this book.  I read it in advance of going to bed and it was the first time I've ever actually enjoyed a story.  My main problems with it are the story structure, the narration, and the author's attitude towards women. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea why I wanted to read this book. I'd already read a lot about women in power and how they are mistreated, and this seemed to be nothing new. The author makes a few claims, but the truth of any of it is very, very murky. One claim she makes is that the first women to be elected to Congress (both from Massachusetts) were not given their jobs due to sexual discrimination. This is true in the sense that there is no evidence that female candidates were ever denied the right to serve. But the first female elected to the U.S. Senate was not even given her position because of her gender. She was the first woman in her state to serve as a U. S. Senator and she was not given her post due to her gender but due to a scandal that nearly toppled her political career. She received her seat due to the fact that she was a veteran and she served for one term as her state's representative. It's interesting to note that there was no woman in Congress before her. The only female senators in the U S were from Connecticut (Julia Grant, Elizabeth Warren) and Massachusetts (Lucy Paskin). The one woman elected to that office, Elizabeth M. Warren, served for only one term (1908). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm reading the newest entry in the series, and it's a disaster, right from the start. The first person narrator's character description reads like a re-hashing of a bad sci-fi movie (the one where a human crew goes missing in space and then gets turned into a robot). Even the names of the people the character describes are bad sci fi movie names, as if the book was based on the recent "Star Trek" movie. Then there's the main plot: a giant space robot has been destroyed on the last trip into space, and, at the last minute, another one is put into orbit just as the ship is destroyed, and that robot is a monster. Why? Why did they make a new robot if the old one was perfect? Then the plot doesn't really hold together until the last thirty pages, when the robot's "perfect" robot is put in charge. That's all there is to it. The rest of the plot is even worse. The main character is described as being from "one of the less powerful races in the galaxy." But why, if he's from such a race, does he have a giant, useless robot that he can't control? Then there is the problem of how the author tries to tie the giant robot's plot into the main character's plot. Why did the giant bot get involved in the first place? Why does he go to the trouble of trying to save the first robot, when he can just send another one? What does he care about the first one's life? And when he gets to the end of the book, the robot that the main characters saved is a terrible monster. How does he get ahold of the robot in the end? It's clear that the authors had a lot of fun writing the book. But the poor writing and horrible, uninspiring characters make this book a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of science fiction over the years but never a work of such obvious bad faith.  This is the worst.  It's not as if the authors were unaware of science. They're authors of books on the subject. They know their science. But they didn't have the good sense to let the science inform their poor writing.  I'm sure the authors know science is false; they're just trying to mislead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a book that will leave you frustrated and angry at how many things in life we know to be true that we just blindly accept because they're easy to understand. You can be the smartest person in the room and still fall for some nonsense like "this makes perfect sense to me" and be stuck with a life that's a complete waste because of it. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is weak at best, the characters weak at worst, the dialog poor, and the style poor at any standard.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't stand this book.  The writing was poor, the book itself was boring, and the story had very little substance.  I finished this book to finish it quickly, but as soon as I started it was gone.   It's clear that this book is a vanity project of the author's.  While I understand that some authors feel that they have to write as if the only way to be popular is to write a book that will sell, this book shows the author really doesn't care about what he is writing about.  His main characters are basically the same two people with the same character flaws that he mentions in the introduction of the book (which in my opinion is not a good idea).  This book was not worth the time it took to read it and I will not be re-reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't care for this book.   In addition to being boring and confusing, it's very preachy.  It's like reading from a bible.  The writing style is the first thing I hate about this book, so I can't see it being good for teaching kids about reading.  As for the content, it just didn't interest me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a young child and never got around to finishing it.   As an adult, I've finally gotten around to reading it...   It's filled with many examples of the dangers of trusting your own memory and judgment, but there's also a lot of information that is just too obvious to pass up.  If you've always wondered why some people's memories can be so faulty, this book is probably the only thing you need.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to reading a nice non-fiction book about the history of the Irish, and was disappointed. The only good thing I took from this book was the fact that it makes the Irish seem like a whole lot more like themselves than is generally portrayed in the English-speaking world. But this is a history written by Europeans and it shows them at their worst. The Irish, on the other hand, are portrayed in a light that is at least somewhat sympathetic. If you can look past the inaccuracies, I think this is an interesting book that is worth checking out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just not good.  I read through and couldn't finish it and I don't usually waste my time on a bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is weak. The characters are weak.   I am disappointed.  I expected a lot more from this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as part of the "The Unauthorized Biography of the Beatles," but found it rather dull and uninspired. The narrative style is dated and overly contrived. The Beatles were so original that they could have been a perfect band; but instead, they became simply another group of people in search of the next big thing. The book ends with the Beatles and John Lennon dying in a car accident (while driving) and that was it. It had little to do with the "real" story of the band. This "The Beatles Unauthorized Story" is a hagiography, with a few good anecdotes mixed in. A waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author's use of the term "submissive" in discussing BDSM is a bit of a poor choice, as it's a term that's not so much used as used incorrectly or incorrectly taken for granted. However, even that does little to redeem this book: it's an amateurish attempt at making BDSM more respectable by equating it with the dominant/submissive dynamic.   It would have been more useful if the author had addressed these problems, rather than continuing to try to shoehorn BDSM into the "dominant/subservient" narrative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's nothing wrong with this book: nothing wrong at all.   It's just a collection of short stories about different people's experiences with the Church.  They're interesting, well written, and you get a good idea of what people who grew up as the Church had to go through, even if the prose is a bit dry.  And then there's this whole thing about Mormons growing up as homosexuals.  I'm not saying the authors are anti-Mormon, but this book is written for people who are not members of the Church, who grew out of their Mormonism in one way or another.  The only difference is they didn't think their experience was such a big deal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for a good novel to read, but my expectations were badly disappointed.   The book is poorly written and badly researched. The author spends an inordinate amount of time describing things that don't really exist, and then tries to fit them in, without really explaining what he's talking about.  Even a basic historical figure like St. John the Baptist would have been a more straightforward subject to describe than some random peasant he describes as a good Samaritan.  There is a great deal of confusion among the various accounts of the life of St. Benedict, the father of monasticism.  It's as though the author doesn't even know who he's quoting, or how to find out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a lot of reviews for this book, and so far most are negative.  However, I've been a fan of the series since the original edition came out, and this book was definitely worth the wait.  There's a lot that the book does right:  - The introduction has a great introduction, with a great opening statement about how important it is to remember how many different types of people there are in this world.  It's not just the evil ones that deserve to die, but the good ones too!  - There are numerous mentions of the different species and cultures of the characters.  This is so well done that it's almost embarrassing that no one has even mentioned it in the other reviews I've seen so far.  - It's been a while since I've experienced a fantasy book that's so engaging.  All the characters have different ways of thinking and responding to situations, and each one manages to come out in a better situation than the one they were in before.  As a reader, you might think that there's no way you could connect to these characters, but you won't when the author gives each one a different personality.  The ending, while a bit confusing, was not, in my opinion, a letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited about the book, and I enjoyed it so much, I even preordered it from the library. However, I feel that the book does not live up to its promise.  I found it difficult to connect with her writing style and even more difficult to relate to the characters.  The character of Jane is supposed to be the most relatable one, and she is portrayed as a little crazy, but I found her difficult to empathize with.  It seems that she has lost her mother after a long battle with depression, and is in a very difficult position in her life.  She was not very happy with her sister when they were growing up.  Also, the main character Jane is constantly talking about her feelings in front of everyone, and it is hard for me to relate and accept her comments.  Lastly, the story seemed to go in an unusual direction to end the book.  Although I liked the ending, it did not fit my expectations for the book at all.  For a book to come out three years later and be as good as this one, it seems that it has to have been written with a certain amount of foresight. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books you will think, "I wish I hadn't bought this."  There's so much wrong with it that you may be thinking the book is so bad that it will make you look bad and make others look bad too.   I thought the book was so bad I would have to make a list of the errors to explain them to anyone interested.  The author makes a number of claims about history that are either false or wrong, and she has no real sources to back up her assertions.  If I had been paying attention to what she was writing about during the Vietnam war, I would know that the war was going badly for the US, that the American public did not support the war, and that people were actually fleeing from the war because of the US actions.  Unfortunately for the author, she didn't get that memo from history, so she made a lot of things up and then used them to justify what she thought was right.  She tries to get her point across by giving a good history lesson, but her poor history lessons show that she doesn't really know much history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not help.  It doesn't help much.  The story is poorly developed.  One of the characters is a character who is very stupid and the story takes her out of the equation.  She makes the mistake of making the other characters do her work for her, and ends up making a huge mess.  When she realizes her mistake she makes it right, but then it is too late.  A very poor example of a stupid character.  And the other character who she has to "help" is a very lame character.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most glaring thing about this book is that it is not written by a scientist or a journalist but by a "dietitian," a self-proclaimed authority on health and diet. The book's main premise is that we should eat what the Paleolithic Indians ate (primarily plant-based foods) because it is good for us. I was skeptical, but I bought the book because my husband has a great interest in "nature." I was hoping that the dietitian would explain why the diet is "so good" without going on about it in detail. Instead, she just tells readers what the book says about the health benefits. She even adds "what makes it so great" in a footnote in the back. This is a textbook example of what a good nutrition book should be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book after reading its glowing review by Richard Dawkins.  It was a good read, but a disappointment.  I found the story of the evolution of a species from a single-celled organism quite interesting, but the character development and the way that these characters react to the events that happen to them was weak.  Perhaps it is just me, but I can't help thinking that the story could have been done more effectively by a different author.  Dawkins's review of the book:   "Bravo to Dawkins for making it through it without throwing up, and for providing me with an interesting, well-written, entertaining book about the evolution and extinction of species."   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't want to read this book, but it is so bad it makes me want to. The author is trying to make me believe that being in love with a "bad" person is a healthy thing and that having someone who can be "badly" bad is a positive.  Unfortunately, he doesn't give us enough evidence to believe that he is making a good case and he ends up just making his readers feel bad by making them feel bad.  The first half of the book consists of a woman's attempts to get the man she loves to see the error of his ways.  Her efforts are mostly unsuccessful, but she makes a very good case for why this love is not as healthy as she thinks.  But her case is undermined by the man's actions and the woman is then left feeling even more guilty and guilty.  She ends up believing that she has caused her husband's "badness," which further makes her feel guilty for being in the relationship.  As the book drags on, it becomes clear that she is going to have to move on.  I hope she has some sort of mental breakdown before she does, because I don't think anyone else would want to stay with a person who makes her "bad."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as part of my general "get off my ass and get busy" series.   The book was interesting and I really liked the ideas but my favorite was that this is not a normal book, it is not an easy read and this book is not even a good one.  I think I had to stop about 5/6's of the way through the book.  The writing is good.  It's clear that the author wanted to present information and ideas clearly.  Unfortunately, the writing is so bad that the book doesn't even come close to being interesting or useful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book but found it very dry and boring.  There was no suspense or mystery or excitement.  The characters were just there.  I just didn't feel like the story was going anywhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time. It is a very expensive, very poorly written book about a subject which is boring to most people: a lot of people spend their lives making very few advances in their careers.   It is an expensive marketing ploy by the authors to sell a lot more books.  It has the feel of the marketing efforts of most other "entrepreneur" authors: They write an entertaining book about their own experiences, with lots of details, but don't have much to back up the claim that they've done anything in their lives.  The authors don't give their work much respect as a good book: it's full of poor writing, poor logic, and bad examples.  I could never understand a single argument in the book.  For example, when talking about the need for people to start their own companies, they say that starting one is always hard because you're just starting out. That's nonsense.  Everyone who starts a business is usually very smart and has a lot to offer the company.  Starting a company is easy because you don't need to learn anything.  But everyone starts their own company eventually:  My own first business, for example, was started when I was 22.  And there was nothing hard about it.  By the time I was 32, I was very competent, and had the whole thing figured out.  Just about all other entrepreneurs are even more incompetent.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot of the book is a failure: a male doctor is trying to treat a young girl with leprosy, and the girl is very religious and doesn't believe in conventional medicine. The doctor is unsuccessful and the book ends.  In fact, a lot of the problems in this book are actually about the doctor's failure to treat her correctly: he believes he can treat her and he just doesn't, because she believes in God and he doesn't. And he has to be in church to even be treated, which causes the patient to lose faith and give up on him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is poor and the writing is sloppy. The most memorable character in the book is a guy who is a good story teller, but has no personality and never makes any real contribution to the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so taken with this book that I had to purchase it as soon as I saw it in paperback.   The book was interesting enough, but I'm disappointed that it doesn't live up to the hype.  The story is simple and it begins as a simple thriller.  It quickly becomes apparent that there are a lot more layers that have to be considered.  There are several questions that are raised and then answered, but not answered in the way that they were intended to be.  When the narrative veers into conspiracy theory territory, there's a problem.  Again, this is a well-written novel, but the plot never resolves.  To be fair, it's not the first time that the author has done this.  But at some point, it becomes clear that the mystery is secondary to the suspense.  This is disappointing, because the book did promise something.  I've enjoyed many mysteries before, but none of them has been as interesting as this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For the money, the only reason I'm giving this one 3 stars is because of the writing. The story is good and well done, but I really couldn't get into it for the way it was written. A lot of the book is a recounting of events that took place between his first book and the new one, and I kept thinking that someone should have cut a few things out to make it more interesting. The plot is mostly about his family, but the real reason he wrote this book is to clear his name. If it was about some other kind of crime, he might have been able to get away with it, but since it was his father who killed his family he felt he had to tell the truth and help his father get caught. The real reason for the writing though is that he is trying to clear himself of a previous book that he was so angry at. The original story was a "How-To" for getting out of jail that was written when he was only 15.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I'm not an avid reader of children's books, I've only picked up one of Ms. Brown's books so far, and while I found the story interesting, it didn't leave me with much.  I think I could have had a more entertaining experience reading it in print, and I think my disappointment at not liking it will probably prevent me from buying the book for my young daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished a great book, The End of the Affair: The Unresolved Mystery of the Death of Princess Diana. The cover features Diana on her deathbed, and there are quotes from her final statement as a testament to life and love. It is so well done that I can't help but be in love with the story. Unfortunately, that love is soon extinguished when the author spends the last 300 pages in a series of lengthy digressions on the "perfect" life of the beloved Diana. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really disliked this book because it was so bad that it didn't even make it into my'read for pleasure' pile.  If you can find a way to describe it as 'not bad,' I'm all for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book expecting to love it, but I'm going to hate it.  First off, I thought it was going to be a story about my family.  Unfortunately, it ends up being about my experience in the mental health care system, and is very biased against the mental illness community.  It's basically a biased, politically motivated, and inaccurate piece of writing.  Secondly, there are several contradictions throughout the book.  For instance, it says that I have a "perfect" life, when in reality I've been struggling with depression since I was 13.  There are many instances where it claims I've done some bad things, when I don't remember doing it at all.  I find it very difficult to believe the authors when they make a claim about me, and then later claim I'm doing great things.  Lastly, there's a big problem with the concept of "recovery" in this book. While many mental illnesses can be successfully treated, this book has no problems using "recovering" as a substitute for good therapy.  The authors claim that the purpose of the book is to help people understand mental illnesses and improve treatment, but it ends being about how we're just as susceptible to bad therapy as anyone else.  Despite my reservations with the book, it did provide some information about how I've benefited from some treatment, and this was a nice change of pace from the book I had read previously.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a novel about the Middle Ages, this book is pretty shoddy. The style and theme are fine, the descriptions are captivating, and the historical research is very interesting, but as a historical text, it is lacking.  It uses some authentic material, but most of the evidence used to support the thesis is highly suspect.  A very interesting and important subject, but the book fails to show that the events actually happened, and that's a pretty serious problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not that I disagree with the analysis of the Second World War, but that I feel that the authors don't have a very good grasp of the issues they are discussing. They use the word "unholy" to refer to Hitler and Stalin as "evil" in a way that ignores the millions of deaths and suffering caused by the Nazis, which is why I'm not sure what they mean. They also don't really mention the political aspects of Hitler and the Weimar Republic, which I feel are quite important, because in a sense the Wehrmacht and SS were Hitler's version of Stalin's Communist Youth. If they had spent more time discussing those issues they would have done a better job. I also think they've overstated the extent to which Churchill was a Communist, and the effect that this had on his relationship with Stalin. They mention that Churchill had a close friendship with a leading Communist, Albert Einstein, and that Einstein was a huge supporter of the British party. But that's not exactly what happened. It's true that Churchill admired Einstein, but they had different views on the Soviet Union. Churchill believed that Stalin's Russia was the logical successor to Germany, while Einstein believed that the Soviets needed to have more democracy than the Weimer Republic. There's a good argument that Hitler was actually more of a Marxist, but Churchill never quite embraced the term, probably out of fear that he could alienate the Communist Party in Britain. I know that Churchill wanted to build a strong, unified country, and Einstein wanted it to be a strong country with a strong democracy. There are a lot of similarities between the views of these two men, and I think it's really important to remember that a lot happens in a short time, and a lot can be said about the consequences of different actions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a typical case of   A writer who doesn't know that it's   The Author's Fault  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually enjoy YA novels but when a book is as good as this one it's a lot more fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of the worst I've read since the publication of The Emperor's New Clothes by Joseph Heller.  It's just too  poorly written, filled with unoriginal concepts, overused characters, and bad dialog.  I'm sorry, but I can't even imagine what Heller had to work with when he wrote this   If Heller had made Heller the protagonist, he would have had to write the bad dialogue  instead of Heller. I'm so disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first half of this book in 3 days, mostly because I wanted to read the rest as quickly as possible.  I didn't like any of the characters, nor their situations.  They were uninteresting as well as unrealistic, because nothing happens that isn't somehow influenced by either fate or the whims of the gods.  One character has an ex-wife who left him for the woman who would become her mistress.  He goes back and forth from resenting her for her betrayal to trying to redeem her by marrying her, which never works out because she has no real interest in marriage.  Another character, a young girl who is told that she is going to die at birth and that she will have to be sacrificed to appease the gods, is tortured to death in a similar manner as a baby in the Bible, and then brought back to life as a human baby, to live her life again.  (I was also very annoyed that the mother was also punished for the sins of her child, which I found bizarre.)  The plot was even worse than the characters.  The protagonist, whom I'll call Jane, has a chance encounter with the priest from the Bible who saved her life and who now protects her.  After their encounter, he tells her to forget about the story she has heard and that it wasn't really like that, and to take him back to his church if she wants to believe.  A couple of pages later, Jane's mother disappears, along with her child.  Jane's stepfather comes to the church and tells Jane that she and her mother are no longer his daughters, and that Jane is the only one who can take care of them.  But the mother never had children, and Jane, who wants her mother to come back to her, is furious.  She storms out of the church, and the priest attempts to talk her down, but Jane is still determined to get her mother back.  At the end, Jane finds her mother, who is dead from poison.  Her stepfather is also dead.  There was no real payoff to this story, and there wasn't anything worth remembering afterward.  It felt like it was written by someone who was trying to make a fast buck with a crappy book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the type of book I don't like reading.  It's a rehash of the same old stuff.  All the problems we already know about - that people of color are less intelligent, less hard-working, less honest, and less able to manage their money - are just recycled.  There are even more ridiculous assumptions, like the idea that all blacks have a natural aversion to snakes.  But worse than all that, the book claims that people are innately stupid because they need to be told what to do, even though that's completely untrue.  I can't understand how someone could come up with such idiotic ideas.  They're such a waste of a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very bad. The main problem is that it is a compilation of many other bad books that are also called "Great Stories." The stories are generally well-written, but most have one or more plot holes, and a number of the characters seem to have little to no real depth. I will not be reading any other books based on the "Great Story" format for the time being.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a huge fan of YA (for me, young adult literature is more adult-oriented) and I have to confess that I found this book to be very disappointing, especially since I had been looking forward to a great YA novel. The novel, which follows a group of young people in a small city, suffers from a general feeling of malaise. The protagonist (the book's protagonist) feels a little guilty about all the things that happen around her and makes poor decisions in her life, despite the fact that she is a bright and confident teenager. She finds herself trapped in an "adult" role and is at a loss to see where to go from there. Despite the author's efforts to make the main character interesting (at least in the first part of the book), she just doesn't have the depth that I look for in a good YA protagonist. The main character herself seems a little too naive for my taste.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and I found it so terrible that it didn't even bother me to tell my friends what a bad idea it was.  As for being offensive, well, that was obvious.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book I learned that I have some serious problems with the meaning of the word "crazed" in the title. My problem is that I never have a good reason to use "crazzed" to describe a bad experience. The crazed part is, to me, a way of saying "a strong negative emotion, especially anger". The anger part, to my mind, is an intensification of the negative emotion. That's all. There is nothing more to it. But I feel like if I can be that mad for a good cause, why can't I be mad at my TV for showing an uninteresting movie? It sounds like a good use of the same word, but I don't think it works.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the best book on the American Revolution ever written. The author does a tremendous job of taking the most important events in the revolution and telling them in a way that makes them not just interesting but readable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book after spending a few days reading a number of books on the subject of child development.   This book contains very little research (although it is based on her own research) and instead relies heavily on anecdotes and what seems to be some really bad ideas.  The most disturbing aspect is the author's belief that there is an insidious relationship between early stimulation and mental problems in children.  I don't want to be mean, but this book really makes me angry.  Children, not adults, should be allowed to make mistakes.  If a child makes a mistake, he should learn from it.  A good education should prepare children for adulthood, not hinder it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read so many bad books that I have developed an almost Pavlovian response to them. I'm really excited about this one. It's going to be a real kick to my sci-fi/horror/fantasy bookshelf. If only I could find a copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed by this book   There is a reason this author does not get published in this genre.   This is not the book I expected when I preordered it.  While I love the idea of "bio-engineered" materials, the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  It is a mess.  There are lots of mistakes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the worst book I have ever read.  The language was terrible, the plots were lame, the characters were annoying, the writing was bad and so was the plot.  It was a terrible book that I put down after a hundred pages or so because I was sick of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband and I recently bought this book from our local library because we thought it would be a good book for a quick read.  The story is told from three perspectives, and from the first person point of view of the young boy, the first chapter is a story about the young girl.  From the third person point-of-view of the boy, it is a report on his family.  While the first two chapters are entertaining and interesting, the third chapter, as the story continues, becomes almost tedious.  I found that my interest was piqued only after the third page, which told the reader how the child in the third position was "treated" by the parents.  Even though I was already interested in the book at this point, I found myself becoming frustrated with the overly dramatic and exaggerated aspects of the final third of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back when I was in junior high. I had some good reviews but I just couldn't really get into it. So I shelved it. But, I am glad I didn't. If you are looking for a novel about a poor girl in the slums of Calcutta, I guess you will like this book. I think I'll read it again when I get a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is poor, poorly put together, and filled with confusing and contradictory references.  The information is presented in a confused and scattered way and does not match any of the examples.  I have not been able to make sense of any of this information.  It is unclear why, for example, a single cell contains only A's, B's, C's, and D's.  Perhaps this is to prevent plagiarism.  This is not surprising, since the authors clearly did not do research.  They could not even find a copy of the original work.   In fact, they seem to have relied almost entirely on secondary sources for their research.   The entire book is a mess that does not have the structure or coherence to be interesting or useful to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read, reviewed, and recommended many books, but this one is my favorite.  The main character, a brilliant scientist, and his brilliant assistant, a gifted student, are the key to the progress of his field.  He has many problems but they are solvable.  I loved all the references to famous scientists (e.g. Maxwell, Planck, Einstein).  I enjoyed the way the author made each character important to the plot, even when they are in the background.  This book is so realistic and is a great read for the beginning or anyone that is interested in science.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't think much about the book. I was hoping it would be a good read and I was pleasantly surprised. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, the writer, a physician, makes claims about a supposed medical miracle.  In fact, the book is filled with a lot of pseudo-science about the supposed benefits of herbal teas.  I found the book to be an attempt to provide credibility to a dubious practice.  The author offers little evidence and uses many anecdotal anecdotes.  He claims that herbalists have cured everything from cancer to arthritis, even curing the common cold!  While I can't say that it has cured me from chronic sinusitis, my sinuses are better than ever 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like it at all. I mean, there are a lot of things in it that I'd do, like read and write reviews on my Kindle, and yet I couldn't stand the end of this one. It was tedious. And at times it's really not even dialogue--it's just a bunch of boring characters who don't really talk. They just sit there talking, never saying anything in a way that matters. I know that's not a good enough reason to not read it, but it's the only thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, it's not a bad novel by any means.  However, it is a good book to read because it addresses a certain problem.  As I say in the end, however, it doesn't solve that problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had the misfortune of reviewing this book for a friend. I'm sure this is not an uncommon experience for most people.   She loved the book.  She had read it so many times it was a real joy.  And then there was this: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't recommend reading this book.  The characters are either one-dimensional or uninteresting, and the descriptions of their activities and thoughts are too detailed and detailed.  I found the author's explanations of her own feelings toward her children to be unconvincing.  It's a shame because she's a very talented writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many bad books out there it's difficult to keep track of them all. This one seems to be the only one that is going to be particularly annoying for me.  It's just so uninspired, and the plot is so bad, it's impossible to take the story seriously.  The characters are so poorly written that it's hard to care about anything.  My favorite line is when the main character gets hit by a truck while driving down the road:  "If only my head wasn't so big." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked the title, but then this book did nothing for me. I'm not the type to be taken in by romance, but I was taken in (and very turned on) by the storyline and the characters. The main character, Anna, is just about as unattractive and unattractive in a bad way as you could imagine. Her parents divorced when she was young, she had no father figure and a terrible father figure who left her in the back of a bus on the way to the hospital. When she got to the emergency room she had two broken legs, and she was taken to a mental ward, where she spent years in a haze, eating, crying and smoking. When Anna's mental health broke down, she ended up in a drug rehabilitation center, where the staff tried everything to get her to stop drinking and smoking, and ultimately gave up trying. Anna eventually gave up, and now she's in her thirties, working as a social worker and living in a two bedroom apartment, working with children. She's trying to keep a clean life, but her habit will never go away. I found the ending a bit contrived, though. I felt like Anna's problems and the lack of her father figure are the main plot points and she's just there to be "saved". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a high tolerance for self-serving bullshit in the form of novels.  I thought the story of the two sisters was a lot of self-important, patronizing nonsense. The book begins with a character whose life is basically a series of travesties.  He is a con man who runs up an expensive fortune in a casino.  Then he dies, but not before scamming his widow out of millions. Then the scammer's brother takes over and the scamster gets his money back, but the brother is an alcoholic who can't pay his gambling debts. Then an idiot lawyer named Larry, a big shot in the legal field, takes over the con man's role and he eventually dies of a broken heart.  The book closes with this pathetic loser who is living a dream of wealth and success, when suddenly he dies of heart failure and his heirs are scammed out of a fortune they never earned.    This is a self-published garbage book.  It would have been much better if it had been written by someone who actually read the book and knew how to write a believable character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that this book was not actually based on any experience I had. It is basically an academic exercise of using statistics to analyze the experience of a certain group. The statistics that they used to show their results have never been tested.  I did not realize the significance of the statistics until I got to the part in the last chapter where they say that people who read the "Liar's Poker" have a higher success rate at making more money than people who do not read the book. The numbers they used in the book did not come from actual statistics.  If you want statistics to be meaningful and to give you an idea of the kind of "knowledge" a certain population has, a better place to start is in a popular movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I read the book, it made no sense to me.  It was so far away from reality that I could not even begin to put it in perspective.  The first 50 pages seem to be about the narrator (as he is called in the book) and his own experience.  These first chapters are very detailed and, in my opinion, help to establish the narrator's character.  But, as I have read other reviews, it appears that the narrator is a complete figment of the narrator.  His life is described as if he were a character in a bad TV drama or book.  I cannot fathom what it is about the book that appeals to so many readers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of obvious historical errors and blatant contradictions that it's almost embarrassing to read.  It is hard to believe that anyone could write a book like this.   I mean, the main point of the book is that the Romans, not the Jews, invented Christianity.  Nowhere does she actually cite the actual evidence for that claim (her citations are too vague to be helpful), but in this book she gives so many different "historical" reasons for this claim that it is impossible to believe them all.  There are numerous other such "histories" in the book which are completely worthless.  One wonders how many historical errors this book will be cited as a source for in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise is that all the people in the world can do anything they put their minds to. This may be true, but then you get into what's actually written in the book and it turns out the people who are supposed to be the wisest are so foolish and easily manipulated. The book is filled with such poor advice that I almost threw it out. What an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to read this book, but the more I read, the more disappointment I felt. First of all, the cover is terrible. It looks like it came from the 1970s, with the bookcase in the middle. The pages are a dead ringer for a 1970s school library: red covers, brown boards, and little more than text.  I found this to be really annoying, as the cover really made the book look dated, and I was looking forward to the book.  Also, there are very few illustrations, and most are quite basic.  Unfortunately, this book suffers for its limited illustrations and dated cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed in this book. While I found some good information in this particular chapter (e.g. the benefits of working with "unlearned" ideas) there were so many bad examples and mistakes that this could not possibly help you. The example of the brain tumor made me cringe, not just because it was so wrong but because it made me think of a previous book (which I bought a copy of and enjoyed) that had made such a huge mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not the biggest fan of the paranormal genre. Most of the "paranormal" novels are terrible, and the books that are good tend to be cheesy, cheesy-o or cheesy, even cheesy with a hint of "you are in over your head" thrown in for good measure.  This one, while not being bad, is a disappointment and is easily the least supernatural-themed book of the four I've read.  If you're looking for a good paranormal book, check out "The Lost Weekend" by Jim Corbett. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was reading a book review of a book by a very famous philosopher when I stumbled across this gem and immediately purchased it.  It was the perfect description of the world we live in.  I loved the fact that it is so non-dogmatic.  The book also includes a history of the development of philosophy in Western culture as it relates to the subject of the book and why it is the way it is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title says it all. The book is nothing but a rehash of the basic "how to" for running a successful running business, but the material is dated, not to mention poorly written.  I know from experience that this sort of stuff is common knowledge, but I still wish someone had written about running a business correctly and using common sense instead of being just some sort of guru. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main flaw in the book is the author's attempt to be an anti-authority voice: to say "it's all your fault".   I have never agreed with the authority figures I encountered, but I was also never sure that they had it right.  While this author does say that women and minorities are more likely to suffer under abusive and/or authoritarian males,  he never seems to provide an alternative explanation to what the problem might be, only offering the most generic statements.  The author is right that there are issues with how authority figures operate, but it does seem that the problem may be more widespread than he admits.  Unfortunately, the book lacks the necessary context to make a nuanced critique.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like reading bad books. I'm often told they're just bad.  Unfortunately, the badness here is pervasive, even if you know how bad it is.   This is a book about an "Aryan" group in the early 1900's.  It is the book that launched the anti-Semitic smear campaign against Himmler.  You'll find descriptions of "blood" and "genetic" purity in every possible context.  The book also describes how HimmLER is an example of "good" and an example to be emulated.  I have no problem with Jews, but I do have an issue with anti-Semitism.  HimmELER is an extreme example of how anti-Jewish hatred has twisted and twisted back into itself, just like the original anti- Semitism.  There are a lot of people who think that Hitler and other Nazis were anti-Semites, and there's something about the anti Semitism that appeals to people, even when it's not really what the original intent of the Jews was.  They can't stand the fact that their religion is being singled out for abuse, so they turn to the Bible, and blame the Jews for it.  This book is about HimmLER, but it's really about how Jews are treated and exploited today.  These anti-semitic attitudes are still very popular today, and if you read this book, you'll see why. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book, but they were quickly dashed by its dull, monotonous, and unfunny style.  The protagonist is an insufferable know-it-all who is constantly trying to get others to follow his every word.  He's constantly complaining about everything and just about anyone he meets, making him look ridiculous and obnoxious.  There are no real laughs in this book.  I understand that the humor is supposed to be a bit dark (or at least that's what the author seems to think) but there's no light to be found.  In fact, I found myself laughing out loud more often than not.  That's not saying the humor isn't funny, but it's not funny enough.  If there's one thing this book gets right, it's being really boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If this book was written by someone who had never written a negative book on a good book, I'm sure it would be a great success. It is nothing more than the "expose' " of an otherwise excellent book by a mediocre author. "In his early thirties, Tom Wolfe moved from Chicago to New York, where he had the opportunity to write about the culture and social problems of the Big Apple. He didn't find much. He also didn't know that he was in New York for the long haul. He moved back to Chicago and wrote a book about a different kind of New York. His new book is, 'All the Pretty Horses.'"   This book is not about a book of the book, nor is it the kind of book you would expect. It's a book that is more concerned with the opinions of a mediocre writer than with the quality of the work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't care for this book. I've finished it. It's about six pages of descriptions of various kinds of plants, and they're all very, very boring. I don  Not very good, but not so bad  This is an interesting book about the history and evolution of plants (I have no interest in reading about how to grow good potatoes). The book is written in the style of a journal written by someone about a trip to Mexico. This is not a bad way to go about this; it would certainly get one's mind off things. But there are too many repetitions of the same ideas (plant growth, growth of seeds, how to distinguish plants in fields, etc.) to make it interesting. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it's easy to find the plant pictures online.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is an interesting study of early modern Europe. I don't agree with everything it says, and I will leave the review here, rather than risk spoiling any other reviews.   The first half of the book is good. The second half is terrible. The first fifty pages are a study of the way the various European countries reacted to the invasion of Islam in the seventh century, but in the second fifty pages we are treated to a tedious account of how European Catholics reacted to that invasion, and the way in which they tried to make a Catholic the new head of the Christian world.   While the Catholic reaction was obviously the worse, the Muslims reaction was, at least, interesting.  It included, but was not limited to, the creation of "imams" -- religious leaders whose job was to lead their followers in prayer and to try to stop the spread of Islam -- as well as the burning of "idolaters."  But the Catholic response was to throw up a "wall of separation" to keep the Muslim immigrants from learning about the Church's rules, and from learning how to behave themselves. The Muslims response was much worse: they burned the "idols" and sent the people who made the idols to hell.  As far as I can tell, no Catholic historian ever says that Muslims burned the idols, and it seems quite unlikely that anyone ever said that Muslims would burn the people they considered idolaters.  While I can't say that I agree with the author's interpretation of these events, the author certainly can't be wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of this book is mostly just "describing the problems with this book."   It's interesting and informative, but you have to be patient with it because you can't get to the good stuff quickly.   I have a problem with the author's use of words such as "stupid" or "idiotic."  The word "stiff" comes up at least 15 times in the book.  It doesn't help that a couple of them seem to have been borrowed from a video game.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My teenage daughter and I reread this novel with great interest. We were both pleasantly surprised at the new and fresh way the author wrote about the early days of The First World War. It was well-written, and it was well told. I was expecting the writing to be a little dated, and I didn't feel that way, but there was nothing dated about the story or the characters. The descriptions of the trenches, the trenches themselves, and of the British officers and the soldiers on the front line all seemed to me to be fresh, vivid, and accurate. We found ourselves thinking about the novel during the long drive home. I also liked the way the novel ended, with a new and different kind of war. I hope the author writes more books about World War I in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book about how the Holocaust was faked. Yes, I have heard it all before. Yes it is just another "hoax." This is not true, and it is a very sad thing that a book that claims to expose it is so full of holes and mistakes. It is not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been in the publishing industry for 30 years. I've had to cut a lot of my favorite authors because they couldn't write well enough to get published and sell books. I don't know how they do it but they somehow keep selling them and I'm always disappointed.  There was no point to these books other than for the authors' names.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As much as I enjoyed the writing of this book, I found myself irritated by the frequent use of phrases like "one should not live in a cardboard box", "one must be a bit nuts to believe in such nonsense" and "one has no right to be a saint" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy this book   It is filled with bad writing, clichés, and stereotypes about African American life that are not only dated but downright insulting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not an easy read and there are very few parts that are easy. I found that the main character's relationship with her brother is so complicated that I had a hard time following the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book.  It's too pretentious, too wordy, too preachy.  The only good thing about it is the ending:  It concludes with a new perspective on how we got into the situation we find ourselves in (like it was an adventure or a mystery or a horror movie) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is predictable, the characters unsympathetic, and the ending has no redeeming value whatsoever.   As if that weren't enough, the author's own writing style is laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a chance to re-read this book in preparation for an exam last semester, and it was a very poor attempt at writing about the Vietnam War.  The writing itself was amateurish (mostly because there are no references to the writing at all in the actual book, just in the author's personal journal), the characters were flat and unlikable (and yet there are some who I believe might have been well-meaning but poorly-informed), the plot and subject matter were a complete mess (even the subject of the book was a complete trainwreck), the historical research (from interviews, declassified documents, government studies, etc.) was a joke (I'm sure the author had the facts at her fingertips), and the conclusion was even worse (my only regret is that I didn't spend more time with this book, rather than taking a long trip on a plane that was already full of people who had paid as much or more to stay in it as I did), but all of those flaws aside, I found it hard to give it less than 1 star, as it was an exceptionally bad book from the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a young reader, I found the prose to be highly pretentious and tedious.   In fact, I would not recommend this book to anyone under twenty-five.  The whole premise of the novel is that humans have no business being a dominant species.  We are too silly, too stupid, too selfish, too violent, and too self-absorbed.  All these traits are supposed to be what has caused our demise.  This is pure propaganda.  It's based on a false history, a complete fabrication, and the ideas of a pseudoscientific cult.  No matter what we do in the future, we will always be at the bottom of the barrel.  As soon as we get our act together, we'll be the dominant species on Earth.  I won't be buying the sequel, which should prove to be even more ridiculous.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and was completely underwhelmed. The characters are not believable. I don't think there is a single believable character. They come across as caricatures or cardboard cutouts of the person they should be. The author's style is not good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book hoping to learn something useful about how to build a successful career.  But I found it much less than useful.  First of all, the author's definition of the "glass half empty" mindset is completely false.  She says it takes about 20 years to make a major financial decision and about 30 to make one with life.  This doesn't necessarily mean 20 and 30 are the same, but I'm very skeptical about the author using her own experiences as a template for anyone else.  Secondly, the idea that someone needs to know how to do everything in life to succeed is a bit outdated.  I'm a big fan of self-directed learning, so I don't agree that you have to know everything from the get-go.  In fact, it's hard to know many things in life at all.  Thirdly, the book focuses too much on the self-made success myth, and not enough on the role of luck and chance.  Some people are born with amazing luck, and some are not.  The author also makes the mistake of comparing hard work to money when it's so much more important.  A lot of people will try to make it in this world without a huge amount of hard work, but they don't get very far.  Even if they work as hard as a house was built with the foundation laid by God (the foundation of luck) and a little luck sprinkled on top, they will still have a tough time doing well.  For that matter, almost everyone makes it in their life without a lot of hard (or lucky) work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is like a bad trip that lasts too long and the effects are so bad that it leaves you feeling sick, tired and dizzy.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  It was like having a really bad day at work and having your boss ask you to take a break from work and watch the movie "Airplane!"  Even though I understood that the book was about a man who had some personal demons and who decided to write his story about his experience, I found it hard to listen to.  I found myself nodding along at all of the jokes and thinking that it was all a sick joke.  Maybe I was too tired and stressed out to pay attention.  A lot of what he describes sounds like it could be true.  Unfortunately, the bad trip continues with the descriptions of the people he was with during the time of the events.  The guy that he was sleeping with was supposed to be his girlfriend.  This is a serious matter for a guy who has a girlfriend and a baby on the way.  But instead of feeling guilty about sleeping with this guy he is totally cool with it.  He even had a threesome with two different women during this time.  And then the guy who was supposed be his best friend ended up sleeping with him a couple of times.   The other friends all seem to be having a pretty good time, but they don't say a thing to this guy.  All of the other people in the group act like they are cool with the situation but the man just can't help but get upset about all of it. If this is all true why doesn't he just tell anyone else about it?  If he was really going through this he could have said something. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book is a disaster from start to finish. The first sentence of the book tells the reader that the book is "not about an airplane". The story is told from the point of view of a passenger who has had an accident and is now unable to fly an airplane. At first the book reads like a work of nonfiction. The author is not a journalist and the information she gives is not researched. In fact the book sounds like an attempt to explain the life and experiences of a famous TV star without actually mentioning him. The main character's description of her life at the time of the accident is unbelievable. She describes herself as having been raised by wolves and living in a cave until her family had to move to New York to survive. She tells of her experiences with drugs, mental illness, and the depression that led to her decision to give up her dreams of becoming a famous actress. She even mentions that her father tried to kill her with a razor blade while she was pregnant. The details are incredible but she does not seem to care about how much truth she is hiding. She also does not feel the need to explain why she went back to her former life. She is a very self-centered person and is unable to see that the others around her may have problems as well. She seems to believe her own opinion and that she knows everything. This causes her to have a very negative view of herself and others. She views everyone else as lazy and incapable of being creative or artistic. She believes the others in her life are lazy as well and that their creativity is "stolen" by people who are not creative. The book does not even attempt to give a reason for this belief. When she is in the present she is able to look at the situation objectively but she cannot see past the beliefs she had while in her past. She claims that she has seen many things and learned many things about life but never believes in the existence of anything new. She sees her life as one endless string of events and events that were not very meaningful in the long run. The worst part of the whole book is the ending. When I was finished I said to my boyfriend, "This book was so bad that if someone wrote a bad review of a bad film, it would be called 'Bad Film.'" Unfortunately, it's the same thing with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a book about parenting, I can't think of any more depressing topics for a parenting book.   In the midst of their excitement and joy over the birth of a third child, Sam and Jessica must now deal with the stress of raising their two youngest children as if their life depended on it.  The tension between children and their parents is so evident in the book, but the authors are at a loss for how to make it more interesting.  Sam seems overly concerned about how his older daughter's new "mum" is taking care of her, but he's so focused on keeping his daughter on a leash and her "parent" happy that he doesn't give much thought to Jessica.  Meanwhile, Jessica's "parenting" methods aren't that different from Sam's; she just seems more interested in pleasing her "mom" and her partner.  I found Sam's anxiety a bit annoying, because his child is probably much more at risk from being around him and his "mom."  The book does talk about "parent shaming," but I wish they used a different word than "shaming" for the behavior that occurs here.  It would be easier for people to sympathize with the book's subjects without being told their behavior is disgusting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of The Princess Bride. It has been my go-to movie ever since I saw it in college, and I still can't get enough of it.  This book is no different; it is a collection of stories with the same characters and the same basic plotlines, but this time the author has added a new story for each character in the book.  All of the characters are interesting, and all of them are flawed, but none are as compelling as Marla, who is a far cry from the naive yet heroic princess who started the story.  Her life is full of pain, heartache and suffering, and she's constantly trying to get back to a simpler time when things were easy.  She's not the most likable character either, but her suffering is so extreme that it's difficult to like her.  There are other characters who get more screen time in this book, but they're still not the main focus of the story, and they're not as well developed as Mar.  I wish Marla was more like the other main characters and got more screen-time.  Overall, I give the book a D-, because the story is very well done, but I didn't enjoy the character development as much as I did with Marla.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited for this book, and when I got the book in the mail it was packed so well it seemed like I had just opened a gift.  It was, in fact, a gift!  In the first few pages, I was amazed at how well-written and researched the book is.  Not only did she write about the experiences of other mothers, she also gave insight into what it was like to be a teenager in the 1960s.  The book contains a number of anecdotes and experiences that were so well written it almost seemed too good to be true.  In addition to giving valuable insight into her own experience, Ms. O'Malley also shares some of the experiences and stories of other parents from different generations.  If you're looking for a good book on parenting, I highly recommend this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to start the book when it was released last year.   It was full of details about early Mormonism that I had heard from other Mormons but never before put into words.  But I found it to be a poorly written, poorly researched, poorly illustrated book.  The book is about Joseph Smith's First Vision, and in it, a large portion is dedicated to "Fanny Alger" (not the same person as the late Helen Mar Kimball), the Prophet's first plural wife.  Here are a few highlights from the early part of the book (page 20, emphasis mine): "Fannie Alger was not Joseph's first choice.  While the Prophet was searching for a wife for himself, he chose Fanny Alger instead of Mary Fielding.   Fanny's age, her husband's status, and her youth (she was nineteen at the time) made her a risky choice." "As the Prophet taught and practiced polygamy, he also found it necessary to choose a wife who was able to be with him in harmony and to give him children." "The Prophet had the greatest difficulty in finding a spouse for himself and had to make numerous efforts to marry Fanny.  In Nauvoo, the Prophet sought and found Emma Hale Smith, who was the sister of Fanny, and was able in her presence to seal Fanny to the Prophet Joseph." "Fannies, Fanny as well as Joseph Smith, were not a very attractive choice."  This is the part that got me thinking:  If Fanny was the Prophet s first choice, as the book says, why were so many other women deemed better?  The reasons given are laughable (the Prophet being in love with Emma, her being married, and Fanny being young and pretty). But why were there so many poor women in Joseph s life?  If I were the Prophet, I would have had my pick of pretty girls.  And why is it Fanny had to suffer for the Prophet?  Why did Fanny have to pay the price for Joseph s indiscretions?  This isn t fair. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to start reading this book, but I have to say it failed to live up to the hype.  I felt I was being fed a line of thought, and never really knew where it was coming from.  It all sounded the same, and seemed to just exist as a means to convey the author's anger at a perceived lack of progress on the world's environmental issues.  The writing was terrible, the characters were one-dimensional, and the ending was a let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book, which I have read and liked several times before. It begins with a bit of background: the protagonist, John, was a marine intelligence officer assigned to investigate reports of aliens on Earth. He discovered the aliens were nothing more than humans with some alien-like technology. He also discovered that many of the humans they encountered were actually zombies. I found the zombies part of the book to be the worst of the three, but that's my opinion and I may be biased because I've had a bad experience with zombies. The aliens were, however, rather entertaining to read about. Their language, their society, and their technology were fascinating. It's not really clear from the text whether or not John is a mutant, and whether or to what degree the aliens are actually intelligent. But it's all fascinating and I was very glad that I picked this up. It should be a regular in my reading list.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a negative rating because I found it to be repetitive and too "scholarly" for my taste. The book also contained a number of statements that made me question how reliable he was in this field. If I find a questionable point to be raised, I will try to think it up and bring it up again in a more relevant book. But, in the end, I would not recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is just too bad that I do not get the joke of the title. The "manic pixie dream girl" is a pathetic loser who will always find a way to get out of her difficulties. She is always trying to find a new way to be a loser. She will probably end up a fat, ugly housewife in a large family and never get a man. No wonder she has no friends. She spends all her time in her room and doesn't want to talk to anyone about anything. She never reads any novels and her life is based on her own stupidity. That is why she is always getting arrested and getting in trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last couple of chapters were very confusing, and I couldn't figure out exactly why I should feel good about a book that is so negative and unprofessional, especially given that the book is supposedly a critique of something I love and admire.  There is so much wrong with this book, it's frustrating that the author is able to make so many claims that seem to be backed up by absolutely nothing.  The fact that she makes the claim about the end of the world being a good thing is a bad thing.  As a science fiction author, I would like to see her put more effort into her work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand the appeal of this book. It doesn't feel real to me, even though it does come from a first-person point of view. It's an amalgam of things I've read before, but it seems like a lot of it is recycled from other sources that I have found more interesting than this. For example, he's mentioned an old novel about a person who has a son with a woman he's never met before. Well, no, it's a re-telling of that in the book The Child Thief by Anthony Burgess, so what's the big deal? Well, it has that sort of suspense that I like. (For example, in the Burgess book, the person with the son doesn't die in the end.) But here, it doesn't have that same impact. It just reads like he picked one of his own old favorite books and just went in there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I had a good read. I thought all the characters were well-developed. And that I would enjoy the stories. But I found myself wishing the author had gotten more out of the two male leads. Not because I hate men, but because their sexuality is rarely explored in fantasy novels. It seems as if they get only two pages a week and they get to be, basically, two pieces of shit. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just found this book. It sounds interesting and well written. I was ready to read the other half, but ended up putting it down after just a couple of pages. I felt like the author was trying to be too funny or clever. The jokes just fell flat for me. I had fun with some of the characters in the book, but they didn't bring much to the story. They didn't have a great voice either. It just seemed like the humor was thrown in there to be a fun thing to do. The ending just didn't make sense. What made it even worse is that the book ends without a clear ending. It's just one cliffhanger after the next. The author said the book is about the "American Dream," but doesn't explain how he came to realize this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to read this book with a very heavy heart. I read it at a time when I was trying to accept a new partner, and I was finding it really hard to get myself to go through with the proposed relationship. I'd been seeing a man who seemed like he would be a good fit, but he wasn't the right guy.  I came to him after my first bad breakup, and he was really the first person I thought about when I wanted to get over my emotional pain.  He had his faults, but I think he had something really special that made me fall in love with him.   When I finally broke up with him, I really thought I'd just have to accept that it would never work out, and that I had been too emotionally invested in the relationship to move on.  But, in the end, he wasn t the right person, and after months of trying to work through my feelings, I'd finally accepted that.  This book has helped me work through those feelings and find a more positive relationship in my life.  Thanks,   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no problems with this book but its flaws are far too numerous for it to be a good book.  The story is an interesting one about a man who has been trying to find a way to make money by inventing things but can't seem to break through to the general market for his products. Unfortunately, his products never seem to be successful in market. Eventually he gives up on trying to sell anything and starts selling his soul.  He is in a pretty bad marriage and is also an alcoholic so this is not a good place to be.    It is interesting though that although his product doesn't do well in market, his soul does better.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character of this book is a very dumb, selfish girl who gets everything handed to her. If the author is trying to show how the world is unfair, her point is lost.  This is her version of a happy ending. She has everything and is so happy that she doesn't care about the others that are getting their own share. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem is not with the writing.   This book is actually very good.  It is just overstuffed with information that is useless and overgeneralizes.  What little that is useful is presented in such a way that it is self-contradictory.  Some facts that are used to support some theories are contradicted by other facts.  A few examples:  One theory claims that an ancient Greek word means "dissolve" and that an important characteristic of this word is that it can dissolve a material as easily as a non-material.  Yet modern Greek dictionaries list this word in the same category as "disgusting" and "unclean."  Another theory holds that the earliest use of the word "salt" in Greek, as we know it, was in reference to a kind of salt water.  This theory has been around since the 1980s and has been rejected by every major source.  If the book is so concerned about accuracy, why is it quoting one scholar as "one of the most influential" in the field of ancient Greek lexicography?  The point is that the information presented here is over-generalized and wrong.  At best, this is just a technical error.  But the book's goal is to make a big splash so it can sell books and attract visitors to its website.  In this case, it has done a disservice to both its readers and to its publisher.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of the Dresden Files, which is what I was first drawn to by the cover. Unfortunately, this book is not worth the price tag (at least not for me) because it is just a poor representation of one character. I don't have enough time to read a novel the way it was written. I've read it twice now, and I'm still not all that convinced. However, I know that if this is your first attempt at writing a Dresden Files novel, you are not likely to get far. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the characters poorly developed and lacking in the kind of depth that would be expected in a classic.  The only truly interesting character, though, is the author's wife, who is only in it for the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second book of James Frey that I have bought; I read the first book (with a friend), and it was much better.  Frey seems to be a nice guy, and he does a good job of writing his book. I'm not so sure about the way he deals with the author of the second (and third) book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of information about the American political system and what a bad idea it is. The author starts off with a little history lesson on the election of George Washington. The only problem I have with that is that Washington actually managed to win an election.   It is obvious the election was a mistake but it is hard to know if it was the election system itself that was the problem or just the fact that the political parties had to get along.  So, in summary: Washington won an election but the election came with two important downsides - one being the election would have taken place under the Articles of Confederation. Another downside is that under the Constitution, there was no way for a third party to win and the only reason the second party ever made it into the government is because George Washington himself decided it was a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise of this book is good. But the way it is presented is so misleading, that I just had to throw it away.  The idea that all of the "bad" books come from the "evil" parents is just plain wrong. In my experience, most of the good books are written by a good person and/or by someone who had no bad experiences growing up.  There is just something about "evil parents" that just sticks in the mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was going to be something really great and it turned out to be mediocre at best. The story line is very simplistic, and the ending is predictable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books I always wish I had written.   I loved The Great Gatsby.  I liked that it was so smart, and it didn't try to be everything to everyone.  But the book is so vague and so lacking in details that the reader gets the feeling that the author isn't even sure what is going on.  It's a pity, because this could have been a really good book if it had been more specific. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for my birthday, and it's terrible. It is filled with badly written blather and cliches that do not belong together.  The characters, especially the female ones, are completely unlikable. The writing style is also awful, as are all the characters. I do not know how anyone can take anything this book has to say seriously.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am really not a fan of young adult fiction. I have tried it and found it to be very cliched and lacking in imagination.   This one was also lacking in any kind of character development.  I think this was written to have a broad appeal to young adults, but that is not the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My second choice in this series (the first being the first installment,  The Sword of Truth  ) was a terrible disappointment.  The characters had more depth than those in the first two books, but the story was still too dull and predictable to keep me interested.  It seemed as though, having been so eager to get on with it, the author got distracted and wrote what might have been his final installment in a trilogy that had never had a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason this is rated so low is that the book was never finished. It started in 1997, and never ended until 2008. That means it ended over twenty years ago. I'm not sure if I'd call that a book, but I think it's more of a blog post. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book with great anticipation, knowing how much I want to like it.   The first few chapters were very interesting, and then they quickly became tiresome.  At some points in the book, she makes some good points about the importance of education and the importance and value of a good education.  Then, the book goes into something called "credibility":  People always tell you, "The teacher is the person I trust most."  But, they always say that with great emphasis.  This means that, if the teacher is trustworthy, then there's no one else you can trust.  I had a terrible experience at my own elementary school.  Even though my teacher was great, the other students were the worst.  That teacher made me feel like I was a fool.  So, when I hear this kind of language, it bothers me.  It doesn't help that, at times, the author seems to make an excuse for poor behavior.  If you're bad, and you're a student, then you don't deserve to go to college.  We need to give all students the best chance in life.  The good news is that, even in a bad school, you can still find a place in college.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book was so good I bought it twice. It is a bit technical for the non-technical, and the ending wasn't exactly what I wanted or expected. So, I can't really say that the book is bad, but the ending seems contrived at best.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book, but it turned out to be very disappointing.  The basic story is good, but there are very few details about the actual work itself.  It seemed to be primarily focused on the authors and their personalities.  They are really not that interesting.  For the author, the story is a way to help make her name and the book a success.  But her story is so flat that it does not add anything to the overall story.  She just does not seem to be that interested in what she is doing or why.  I do not think it is necessarily a bad thing if she does not really care about what she does.  There are lots of other authors out there that I have not read much about, so I am not too sure what exactly the value is in reading her story, but I do think she could do a much better job of writing about what actually is going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is interesting in a way that I'm sure will make people want to read the next book (it's not just "the story of" the book's protagonist--there's a lot of action and adventure in it), but I was disappointed in how it ended. I thought the narrator was just saying what she thought, but instead, she made a bunch of big promises to a guy and then didn't live up to them, even though she did say she was "100 percent confident" that he would see what was "right in front of [her] eyes" (a.k.a. his wife). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book is hard to put down, but for some reason this one was so hard for me that I went and threw it on the floor.   As the title implies, this book explores the subject of children's books and how these are often written by children, or written by adults who themselves have never written before.  I was not disappointed, though.  Despite its flaws, it has some good stories and examples of excellent writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, but sadly, it falls short. The characters are stereotypical and the plot is a bunch of cliches.  The only redeeming factor is the ending, but it's so forced and contrived that I won't even bother to read it, and will just keep waiting for the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing style is a bit too smooth, and there is a great deal of repetition.   I felt the story lacked a sense of urgency, and while the characters are interesting, I didn't really want to read about them.  I found myself reading about the other characters instead, and not about the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise of this book is that men will never get what they deserve in this life.  It is not my first read on this topic so I will not go on the whole men are losers theory, but  I would disagree.  Men and women both suffer from the same things, and the way that women deal with the problem is to try to force their way around it.  There is no justice in the world when it comes to money or sex.  I think that men, because of our nature, do have to try harder than women to get what we want and deserve.  For this reason I am in favor of women having the same opportunity to get rich and get sex as men do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't feel that the main character did much, and even the character he did feel a little more developed (the only female one) didn't really stick in the end.  It felt too forced, too much like an extension of the first book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think anyone is going to be convinced to read the original trilogy by the first book, especially when the sequels are just as awful as the first one.  These two books are the worst I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so impressed with this book, that I gave it 4 stars in my book review.  The concept of self-determination is one of those things I wish more people understood about, but in a way that is completely opposite of what most of us do.  In a book about self-reliance, self-discipline, self awareness and self-esteem, it's easy to read and understand. But I think that when it comes to "Self-Determination," I'd be more comfortable reading a book by a self-proclaimed "freedom loving" Christian rather than a self proclaimed "libertarian" or "free market" advocate. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was interesting, but it fell flat. For one thing, the information is so poor and so far-fetched that I couldn't believe a person like that could have actually accomplished what he described. It's also obvious that the author was trying to impress his reader with his experience with flying the F-35 in combat. He was able to do it (but not very well), but he did it for an average of 4 hours per day, over a period of almost two months. That's pretty poor, especially for a professional, which he wasn't. There are other things that were really off-putting: his references to the "Tajikistanization" of the U.S. military and his claim that the Afghans will accept anything we throw at them. His ideas about the Ummah being more united than the Ugricans, with the only difference being the language spoken by the Mujahideen, are very misleading. In fact, it sounds to me like he's just making stuff up. His explanation about how the Mujahedeen took over Afghanistan is even more questionable. He implies that the only reason they took over was because they were better fighters. This is absolutely untrue, as many of the Mujhadi fighters were actually much less experienced than the Taliban and al-Qaeda. There's also his claim (without any evidence) that the Mujashedeen were given training by Pakistan. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is written by a man who hates children and thinks their interests are bad.  Unfortunately, he also believes that their interest in computers is bad. I found the child-centered aspects tedious and the non-child-centered parts tiresome.  There are a couple of interesting ideas in there (I will try to discuss some of them in a future review), but he just doesn't care for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My husband and I bought this book about the history of medicine to read together. This book is more or less an insult to the medical profession. The authors make several fundamental errors in their scholarship. The most fundamental error is that they claim that the early Hippocratic Oath, which declared physicians not to prescribe medicine as a matter of course, was not a Hippocratic law, but rather a Roman law passed in the late 60's/early 70's. This is utter nonsense. The Oath was very clear:  When you prescribe medicines, you shall not charge a patient the cost of these. If you have any doubt about the need for these medicines, ask yourself if you could live without them. If, after consulting your patients, you conclude that they need these medicines in the treatment of illness, then you shall prescribe them. I have used the Oath for more than forty years, and it has never given me any pause about using these medications.  The next obvious error is the authors claim that Hippocrates advocated not allowing a patient to be in the same room as the physician in the case of surgery.  Hippocrates actually advocated such a measure. He stated that patients should be allowed to be examined before any medical procedure (such as surgery) was performed. However, he felt that such a policy could not be enforced, so he allowed a woman to be the physician and to do the operation. He also noted that the only circumstances in which a male physician would have to remain with a female patient was for "a woman's emergency." This is just plain wrong. While it is true that he advocated some form of a "gender separation policy" for surgeons, he clearly felt it was inappropriate to allow any type of separation in cases of emergency. While he was a great man, Hippocrates did not have any "gender differences" that we would recognize today.  In the case they cite, the patient had "a severe bladder infection" that was being treated with the medicine for which she had been prescribed.  Again, this is a terrible example of the authors' ignorance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is really a terrible book. It is written by a woman who is apparently a very smart person, but it is written for a very narrow audience. If you are not a fan of the Harry Potter books, you will not find anything in this book that is new or interesting. It was just recycled.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My mother is a devoted reader of science fiction, and has spent years devouring everything from Arthur C. Clarke to Star Trek, and I thought that her opinion on this book might be valuable:  It's not so much that the author is trying to tell us that we're living in the future as that the future itself is telling us that it isn't the future that is promising but the past. While I'm grateful that it's not the 20th century I'm currently living in, I'm left scratching my head at the fact that some writers still feel that this is the best time to write about our present and future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't recommend this book highly enough. I don't think I've ever heard so much good about a book. The narrator does a good job portraying the lives of the three women (although he can sometimes be a bit wooden), and even though there's only one main character, she really comes alive. There's an amusing bit about the narrator being a "snobbish old man," but the book as a whole is filled with such good stories that it's hard to find fault with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In fact, I would have given this book five stars had the second half not been so depressing.   I was thoroughly disappointed by the ending.  I loved the first half and the writing was so smooth that it was impossible not to believe in the characters.  However, I was disappointed in the final scenes.  The characters seem to be on a downward spiral, and the fact that they were able to survive the first two thirds only makes their decline worse.  Not only that, but there was too little explanation about their situation.  This was an issue even when the characters were working together.  These problems may be the reason why we never see them again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book by someone not a real journalist is a real good book. It's not the kind of book you can just pick up and start reading and get everything. It takes a little work and I'm sure the authors made plenty of notes to help the next writer pick up where they left off. But for me, even as a complete noob, I was able to pick out all the nuggets of valuable information within. As a matter of fact, I didn't notice a single typo in the first 250 pages. It is that good. It even gives me hope for a great future in journalism." - David R. Ebert, author of "My Name is Earl"
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only book I read this year that didn't have some flaw that made me throw it in the trash is The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. The Girl is full of what I assume are good ideas but that simply aren't executed as well as I would have liked. I don't know how I missed this before, but I did. It is an interesting and original book but the execution leaves much to be desired. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been searching for a good book about religion for a long time. After reading this book, I'm happy to know that I've finally found one. The authors make the important point that it's okay to have non-belief as part of your religion, but it's not okay to make that religion the most important thing in your life. In this book (and many others, I believe), the authors don't say anything negative about religion, they just call it silly and misguided. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book begins with a brief introduction on the concept of "moral ambivalence." I was fascinated by this concept when I first heard of it as a graduate student in moral philosophy. I read all of the articles about "moral ambiguity" in professional journals (including my own at the time), but I could not find a single article that discussed the subject with any clarity, much less offered an analytical solution to the "moral ambiguities" that arise in everyday life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased the book to read it for my son and he said he wasn't interested. I liked the story about the three daughters and their dad, but I couldn't get into it. I didn't like it as a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was great in the beginning but as it went on the prose and story took a nose dive. The story and characters went from bad to worse and I felt bad for anyone who had to sit through the whole book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you think this is an interesting read, and you're willing to put in a few minutes to read it, you're in for a nice surprise.   The "mystery" is so thin and unsatisfying that it's more of a distraction than anything else.  The author tries to explain why the protagonist may be "faking" her death, but the explanation isn't really clear, and the narrative drags on for way too long.  This is a book that is far better at being annoying than it is at being good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe I've just wasted my time with this. I've read books on astrology and the occult but never this.   Astrology is all about prediction and reading the past but this book isn't even about astrology.  It's more about the way people interpret the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the early 1970s a friend invited me to her wedding. I went, as did a few others, to drink with my friends and her relatives. The event was ruined by my friend's family's repeated request that I "not drink," a request that only worsened after she was "discovered" at the party to be "high as a kite."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A terrible book with poor writing:  "My brother had a bad reaction to the antidepressants he was taking for several years. One day a couple of months after I'd been taken off him, he said, 'I wish I'd never taken the meds. I'm not feeling well and my mind is racing.'" It's clear that this was written by someone with an ax to grind, as the first two sentences describe his brother as a "bad reaction" to the medication. That's not the same thing as someone with severe mental illness, or someone who actually has severe mental illnesses. He doesn't go into great detail about how he managed to get off of the med's, but there were three major factors that had to be addressed: 1. his anxiety and panic attacks, 2. the withdrawal symptoms, and 3. the suicidal thoughts. The first two were managed and cured by the med, but then he began experiencing suicidal thoughts and felt the need to end his life.   I'm afraid that the author is trying to say that because someone has a bad time with antidepressants, they should have stopped taking them entirely.  If that is true, it would mean that anyone taking medication for mental illness should do so only when they feel that they're truly ready to stop.  It would mean we need to test all drugs and medications before giving them to everyone. I have seen the effects of people not getting the medicine they need.  A friend of mine is a manic depressive and he was prescribed many different drugs, but none of them were working.  He finally just said he didn't want to live anymore.  Unfortunately, he ended up shooting himself after he was on one of those drugs for so long.  We can see how people can get worse and end up dying after getting too much medication, but we also see the effects when the medicine does its job.  This book sounds like it could have been written by a mental health professional who has never gotten sick.  I just wish that it would have been edited a little bit before publication.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so bad I can't put it down.  As bad as it is, I hope the bookseller doesn't sue the author for damages.  I read the introduction and had high hopes for this book.  After reading a couple of chapters I found it to be full of errors, omissions, contradictions, poor logic and just plain stupidity.  My guess is that a good number of people who are trying to write a good book have been so inspired by their previous efforts that they have created a bad one.  The whole thing seems to be motivated by the desire to get some publicity and sales.  But no matter how you spin it, the author doesn't have anything useful to say.  She doesn't seem to understand what science is about and what science writing is about.  Science isn't about proving something.  It's about exploring what is.  And in science, when you find something that doesn't fit the pattern, you stop.  When you find a contradiction, you acknowledge it.  In science, you can't change your mind after reading all the evidence.  That's the way the evidence works.  Scientific theories are constantly revised as more evidence is found.  If the book claims that science is always right, and that's why it's wrong to change your minds, then we should also expect science to change as new evidence comes in.  There are two reasons that this book doesn't stand up to scrutiny:  1) The author has failed to make the case that genetic engineering is in fact a bad thing.  This is despite the fact that she repeatedly states that genetically engineering crops is "not only safer and more nutritious, it may be necessary to save the world from famine."  The reason this is so important is because if genetic engineering turns out to be a disaster, the world will be back to using genetically engineered foods and other such foods that are not very healthy.  2) She's failed to explain why people who support genetic engineering are not bad people.  How is that genetic engineers have any moral standing at all?  How can they justify changing nature when nature is inherently bad?  They can't.  They're just following the lead of their predecessors.  You have to question whether this is really just about self interest at all.  For example, why isn't there some anti-GM organization that's against genetic engineering because it's bad, even though it might be good for human health?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a good read, for me at least. I know that some people will like it, but I found it to be a disjointed mess of bad writing and over-the-top rhetoric.   I read the title before I began the book, and my first thought was that it would be a dry technical treatise on the nature of money and financial engineering. But it is neither of these things.  It is about something else entirely.  If you want to know more about the theory and history of gold and silver, this is not the book for you.  There is some useful information about gold and the theory of money, but there is so much wrong about it that it is hard to understand.  This is an interesting book to read, but you will be bored if you're trying to learn something new. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the first in a series and the only one that I liked a lot.  It was the second one I read after having been disappointed by the first.  The characters were not interesting, and the worldbuilding was poor.  There were several problems that had to do with the writing, from the characters and plot to the plot and world.  This book could have been good had the first book been so great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all. It is the second book in the trilogy that I enjoyed reading but found tedious, this one just had too much of the same themes and a very long time frame (almost a decade) before the book got interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book. As a longtime fan of science fiction, I was eager to read The Long Tomorrow. I thought it would be a fascinating look at how technology advances over the past 100 years. What I got was, to put it mildly, not quite what I expected. Although it takes place in the distant future, the setting seems more like a late-20th century society. The story is told through the viewpoint of a scientist from the future. The main character is a young man who is studying the consequences of the rise of artificial intelligence. The scientist's viewpoint feels more like the views of a teenager than a scientist who is well-versed in the science of his day. What makes it worse is the narrator's tendency to use a character's opinions as if they were the only valid ones. The result is that the book seems to make fun of a young person's opinions. While the book does have some good ideas, it's a poor excuse for a sci-fi read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a good novel about the horrors of war, this one falls short. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no reason for this book to be in print. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not going to lie, I was pretty annoyed and disappointed by this book. In spite of its many shortcomings, I do think it's worth a read. It was not a pleasant read for me at all. I have a very bad case of book addiction, and have read countless books from all genres.  Unfortunately, all of them have been so terrible that I have given up on the genre, except for some good mysteries and romance.  So it's a real bummer to be so disappointed by a book that I've already read so many times.  But I digress.  In any case, I'm hoping this book will be the last one of its kind.  And for those of us who still enjoy this kind of writing, maybe it's time to start reevaluating our favorite books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed.  It has many good ideas.  There are few instances where the prose is at its best.   It is, however, full of unnecessary historical references.  Also, there is very little in the way of action.  I found myself wishing for a bit more plot, especially since the author seems to believe she has some great insight into the events leading up to 9/11. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife and I have been in love with books from the 60's and 70's, but these books are just bad.  They all have an obvious style problem - it's the type of writing that could only have been done by a person that didn't know any better.  It makes it difficult to understand what they are saying, and they don't even have the brains to figure it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed reading this book, but it was a chore. The author makes several poor assumptions about his audience (which were true) and the author does not engage with the various problems in his argument. This book is only three hours long, and it is hard to watch all of these poor assumptions being made and ignored (and even defended by the author). I had to put down the book because it was not engaging or interesting. I think if I had been in the audience, I would have left a long time ago. I will most likely read another book by the same author in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be disappointing.  In one short section, Rabinowitz discusses the death penalty, concluding that it is immoral:  I have learned that there is no justice in using the death pen to punish the guilty, and there is an inherent injustice in using it to punish those who are innocent.  I don't feel that the death penalties are deserved.  But this is not just a moral condemnation.  When one looks at history, one is struck by how often innocent people have been executed under very difficult circumstances.  Some of the most notorious examples were that of Adolf Eichmann and the Armenian genocide.  It is unfortunate that Rabinowitz does not address these cases, but he does not delve into their social, cultural, or moral impact either.  The death penalty also appears to be unjust because it does not fit with the concept of equal justice.  We live in a world in which people are judged by the color of their skin, their religion, their physical abilities, and their sexual orientation.  If a black man is sentenced to death, is it fair to sentence him to death as well?  Is it fair that people with mental disabilities, alcoholism, and homosexuality are executed?  These are all human problems, not just the result of bad decisions.  Furthermore, this book fails to discuss the effects of the death sentence on families and communities.  According to a 1994 study, between 1985 and 1992, the death row population in the United States increased from 10,000 to over 45,000.  These numbers are not simply the number of people who die from execution.  They include all inmates who had been sentenced to die, as well as the relatives of those executed.  Families are torn apart by the sentences, and sometimes the parents must choose between being part of the family or being separated from their children for a long time.  This can be extremely painful and traumatic for everyone involved, and is in some cases the most traumatic experience for those who have been condemned to death.  Rabinowski's conclusion that the "death penalty does not work" seems to be based on his own personal experiences.  He writes that he tried the death sentencing approach with many people, but was never satisfied:  "The death penalty does nothing to stop the behavior. It seems to work more to perpetuate it."  Riddick's writing style is conversational, conversational like someone has just given a lecture.  There is no
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in a week and felt absolutely   totally    not   like   the   book  .   It was so bad that I threw it away   with disgust 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time.  This author has not been in the business of writing about anything interesting, but he has done so on this book.   It's a collection of short stories, and they are very dry.  They make me want to pull the covers off my hard drives and throw them in the dumpster.  The stories are so flat and uninteresting that it's almost insulting.  I don't think you can learn anything from this book other than how not to write. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a very good book. It is extremely cliched, not a true history. And the author makes the readers believe that the Arabs were the most advanced people of their time when it was in fact the Greeks who were more advanced. The author, in an effort to prove the superiority of the Arabs, makes the claim that the Greeks invented democracy, developed free cities, and were the first to use the alphabet and to have a written language.  In the ancient world there was no alphabet and the alphabet was not invented until the second century after Christ. It's as if the author wants you to believe that a race of people who have been living on this planet for 5,000 years could only have been so advanced as to invent the alphabet.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be, at least superficially, an interesting book.  I'm interested in evolutionary psychology and was surprised how many of the books I've read that mention the subject were written in a more serious, even scholarly tone.  Even though evolutionary psychology is a controversial topic (to say the least), I was interested in this book due to my interest in intelligence in general and the question of what drives our intelligence (the so-called "g factor").  I also enjoyed reading the chapters on social and emotional intelligence.  However, after having finished the book, I feel it was more of a fun read than an interesting one.  The first five or six chapters are interesting, but the last five or so chapters were really just a series of trivia questions (including the one where the author writes that her research subjects thought a frog was a dog or a baby)  In short, it was a book about what is in the book and what isn't, but not much more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The prose is so bad that I gave up. I don't understand the point of it. The characters don't speak. I thought it was going to be funny, but it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book, and now I'm wondering what it was about, how I could possibly have loved it.   First of all, it seems like the author didn't really want to write a story about gay people.  The character in question had some potential, but she seemed to be a blank slate, like the one in the book who wants to be white, only to find that "being white is also pretty cool."  And then the character's parents try to indoctrinate her in the ways of the white, cis-gendered patriarchy (though she makes no comment on their use of race as a determining factor in the choice of a partner).   But even that is kind of silly because, unlike the white cis-male patriarchy that she hates, that family doesn't have to exist.  It's one of those "Why not the others?" things, like "What about the lesbians?  That's just a different form of oppression!"  It just feels like there were no real stakes to the story, other than that she'd come out as gay someday.  Even when she mentions her first boyfriend, who is black, I just knew he was just making excuses for their being together because he thought they would get married (it's a good thing the book doesn't mention that they're still together, because that would have made that whole story a lot harder to buy).  But still, what's wrong with a great gay romance?  It was hard not to want to believe that this is how it was supposed to be, that she would eventually find love, but I wasn't convinced.  I suppose I could be convinced that this was how it's supposed to have been by the end of the book, but the rest of the story felt very forced and didn't feel real. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a good book, but this one didn't live up to the hype.  The book is about a young girl's encounter with a young man, and the two of them fall in love.  I thought that they would end up together, since they're both young, beautiful, and smart.  But it's clear from the start that they don't share any of those traits, and it doesn't seem like they're going to in the end.  They have sex, and I thought it was hot, but it never really builds up to anything sexual.  As they argue, the man tells her to "let your face go" because she's looking too cute.  It's the sort of thing that a good novel would use as the perfect metaphor for the characters' relationship problems.  After they break up, the girl is shown in a bikini, wearing a necklace with a peacock on it.  Then, she's shown in another bikini, but on a beach.  All of these scenes make the book seem so much less believable.  Perhaps that's the point, but that's not what I wanted to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a poor reflection on my character.  It is full of personal faults and poor reasoning, especially concerning women, which were totally inappropriate for the topic at hand.  I am not a woman so these shortcomings were not important.  In addition, the book's conclusion is an outright lie, based solely on what the author, the author's mother, told me about the book.  This is an absolute slap in the face to women everywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book tedious and tedious.   The author never bothers to explain anything, so that it's just a series of boring rules to be obeyed.  One example:  I was trying to come up with a new way to teach a child about the rules for cooking eggs.  It sounded very complicated but was really simple.  When I tried it myself, it didn't work as well.  So I was disappointed.  This book has made me want to read up on basic cooking skills and give up on learning them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had so much fun reading The Cat in the Hat as a child that I bought it as soon as it was published. It's been many years since I read it (and the fact that it is narrated in the third person is so cringe-worthy that I almost never finish the book), but I keep coming back to it. Even with the flaws, the characters and the stories that are told are very entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a big fan of genre novels, but I picked this up not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised that this book wasn't so boring. It wasn't a thriller either. It was a mystery. And I liked that. I loved that they kept coming back to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't read this book, but found it at Barnes and Noble online and figured it was a good value (since I don't have any other books on the shelves).  The story takes place over a number of years, which is nice, but the main characters were kind of boring (the two men).  In addition, the book was too long, and I was trying to figure out the whole time what they were talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is so bad and full of so many errors that I can hardly believe it's not a work of fiction. It goes on about three paragraphs about a man who, for reasons I'm not going to get into, is obsessed with a girl and has been taking a perverse interest in her since she was 14. It describes various sexual activities, from the most innocuous to the most dangerous (like kissing under a bridge, or sitting at a roadside booth). When the girl starts to resist his advances, he responds with "I've got the power" and "The girl will be mine in no time," which are phrases that seem to be intended to inspire fear rather than to inspire arousal. As the man talks about his sexual fantasies, he makes it sound like they're actually real, not just fantasies. The next paragraph describes a woman's first time. She thinks she's had a sexual experience like the man describes, but it's actually not as bad as she thought. When the man mentions "sex with another woman" he sounds just as crazy about that as he does about the girl. The woman realizes that it isn't real. He insists that it is, and then goes on to describe his sexual experiences with other women. The author then admits that it's all a fantasy, which seems to me to be the conclusion that should have been drawn from the first paragraph. Even more bizarre is that in the book he mentions "anal intercourse" but makes it clear that he is talking about oral sex, and never, ever penetrative anal sex. He describes a group of women and how he "happily cums on each of their cunts at least once." How did he find those people? That he could get so many orgasms from the cunts of women who were never even on his radar seems to be just a matter of luck, or a result of the author's sexual frustrations.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are just too many obvious errors in this book. Not only is it badly organized, but there is just so much wrong about this book, that it takes more than just a bad review to convince me that it is a good book.   One of the most serious errors in the book concerns how I understand God's relationship to people. There is a section in the first chapter that seems to imply that God is more interested in saving one person than another. However, in a later section, he actually explains that people will be saved by the grace of God because "I have not assigned to anyone the work of salvation, but it is theirs as the work is God's." It seems that God does not assign responsibility for salvation, because God does nothing to assign responsibility. God assigns salvation to the people because He wills them to be saved.  This is a total contradiction with what God has said.  The next serious error is that I take the Bible literally and interpret it literally. I do not. In fact, I read the Bible with a serious attitude of critical thinking. I understand that there are a lot of contradictions in the Bible and that there is room for interpretation. However I don't think it is the job of the church to interpret everything literally. The Bible is a very important book and it is to be used in a variety of contexts. In other words, we should not claim that our interpretation of everything is accurate, but instead we should use our interpretation in a critical way to understand the biblical text and its intended meaning. I was completely astounded to see that so many people in my congregation were interpreting the Bible to mean that homosexuality was a sin.  In this particular chapter, I had already decided that this was a serious problem for me, but I was still surprised to see it in this particular passage.  It was not just that this passage contradicts what I had been taught in my Sunday School class and in church, but that it contradicts the entire theme of the book. I had always been taught that homosexuality is not a sin, that only heterosexuality is.  I was not aware of the other passages in the chapter that contradicted this theme, but then I started looking at it and realized I hadn't noticed them before. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed that this book was released before the final season of Game of Thrones.   The characters of Arya, Bran, and Sansa are all so well developed that we could understand everything they do and see what their motivations are.  This book focuses more on Arya and Sans, who both have their own distinct personalities and issues to work through.  Sansa suffers from extreme loneliness as well as having an inordinate amount of resentment toward her brother, and the events of the book are incredibly relevant to her character.  Arya is the opposite of her sister, and has a very twisted sense of justice.  I thought her character development was extremely well done, but that her motivation for the Red Wedding was completely ridiculous.  The rest of the characters are so much better developed in the book, that I really couldn't care less about these two women.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my favorite books, but not anymore  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book hoping that it would be something different but ended up bored to tears. It didn't help that the author spent the first chapter explaining what a good idea plagiarism is. It was very odd, very confusing, and totally unrelated to her book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this to be a very poorly written book and I found it hard to follow. I do not understand why it was required to learn about the subject, since it did not seem to fit in well with the rest of the book. It is all about the book, not the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried reading this book over a decade ago and never really enjoyed it. I was a big fan of John Steinbeck and all of his work, but I felt like The Grapes of Wrath had been written by someone else (Steinbeck's wife). Steinbeck was a fascinating writer but not like this. The characters were weak and had no motivation whatsoever. Steinbeck had a very compelling prose style, but here, it was a poor fit for the story. I'm still looking for a John Steinback book, but probably not until I get over this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book!  It is so funny.  The characters are so lovable! I think the jokes were written in a funny way.  But they are also a little crude.  I do not think this is the book for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a terrible book.  It's clear that a lot of time was spent on rewriting a poorly written manuscript, with lots of new words, and that's the main problem.   The author seems to have written a good book, but not the one she wanted it to be.  I don't recommend this to anyone, unless you're an expert on English grammar. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book.  I've read and reviewed a lot of books that are about writing, but I've never read one that is so full of inaccuracies.  It's not even an innocent mistake.  There's this weird, bizarre mix of facts, half-truths, half truths, and outright lies that comes out in the last two thirds of the book. It all makes my head hurt.  And it's just sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book opens with a great scene in which a student confesses to having been sexually abused by an adult as a child. Then the book goes off the rails, as it often does, and tries to address the fact that the student didn't abuse a child, but rather had an "inappropriate relationship" with a woman and a young boy as an adult.  It is the most offensive book I have ever read, full of factual errors, flawed logic, and blatant attempts to put the blame on a victim.  I was also irritated by some of the examples given by the author in support of her argument, and by a couple of her statements that seem to have been taken out of context.  If it was so easy to abuse children as a teenager, it is unbelievable that some people don't abuse children anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is very sloppy. It jumps from topic to topic, even if it's clearly established what it's talking about before. Even though I understand that certain points need to be said, the point is usually made with enough ellipses and footnotes that the reader has to wonder what's actually going on. This gets particularly frustrating in the discussion of a certain book by a certain author. The author makes an argument in support of his or her book, but then, inexplicably, spends almost the entire section (or perhaps the entire book) explaining how the argument isn't really a good one. If the author wants to make a case for his or one's book, I understand why he or she would do that. But if the author believes that any argument for a bad work can be made with one page of discussion (which is not uncommon in academic writing), that argument is not good enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The bad : There were many things that were wrong with this book. First of all, the author had a habit of describing a scene from an action movie by saying "the scene was so dramatic I wanted to cry." This is like describing a beautiful sunset and saying "It was so perfect that I wanted it to be real." The second problem was that the story was too repetitive. There are many scenes in the book. Many of these scenes repeat from one chapter to another. The author does not try to tell a new story in each chapter but just repeats the same thing from one scene to another and it just becomes tiresome. The final problem is that the author uses a lot of literary devices, like the device of "twisting" a word or phrase to fit the plot. This is something that is used in literature but has been done to death in a bad novel. This kind of device does not really belong in a real novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's the first of a trilogy and my main complaint is the character development, in particular the development of the protagonist. The main character, a young woman, is extremely naive and idealistic. She wants the right to live for herself, not necessarily for others. She does a lot of good in the beginning and gets a lot more, but she soon finds herself losing interest in many of these good deeds as she realises that she can't really do much about what she can no longer control. It's a bit disappointing to find a character so far on in the book who is so idealistic that she thinks she can just pick up and move to the next city after her apartment is burgled. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting this book to be a disappointment. What I got instead was a pretty typical story of a woman's journey in love. There's a little romance and an interesting look into a marriage but not much more. The plot is a little predictable and the ending is a tad disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for a Christmas present to myself, but I found it so shallow and unsatisfying that I gave up on finishing it before putting it in the recycle bin.  The plot is so shallow that it has to be told in two parts. The main character is a young man named Ben, who is so insecure and self-centered that he starts to make a list of all his faults.  Then he makes a list to prove to himself that he is not flawed, and that he does not need to be reminded of his shortcomings every day.  As he grows, he realizes he has a lot of strengths, which he is learning to appreciate more and more each day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the last book by Richard Brautigan I will ever read.  It is an easy read, but the main problem is that he does not understand what he is writing about or how to write it, which results in some very poor prose, awkward sentences, and a very poor idea about how to use his subject.  He writes about some very interesting and important ideas, but does not know how to express them or how he can help them to work in a coherent way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about two brothers. My brother is the more aggressive of the two. I'm just the "tough" one. One day, my brother takes out his frustrations by ripping out the batteries from our portable television. I don't think that this has ever happened to me. I was furious. I told him it wasn't going to happen again. He said he's just going to have to break the plastic and I better accept that. One of the other times, my other brother had to go into the bathroom to take a leak. I asked him to do it first. He told me he needed to "clean up the mess" before he could do anything else. I said I'd go with him, but he wouldn't let me. He got mad and told me to mind my own business. That's when I had to break out my own copy of the book to deal with him. He called me a bitch and told my mother I had no mother. I wasn't mad at him that day. I just needed to vent to someone, and I needed to be the one who was told what to do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no redeeming qualities. It was a waste of my time and is so boring I can't stand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to read when I first started writing.  But, I couldn't put it down.   It's just a bunch of boring stuff that doesn't really add anything to my knowledge. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read all the reviews on this one and decided I can't put it down. It's so depressing that I thought about suicide. It reminds me of what happens to those who go to the end of their rope in the end. But it doesn't mean you can't read more and not kill yourself. This is a brilliant book, filled with so much heart and love. It will change your life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book about love and death. I read it to my children and was horrified. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the course of reading this book, I came away frustrated by the author's poor sense of humor. He tells the story of the French philosopher Rene Descartes in a way that is comical and absurd, but not particularly educational. For example, he talks about his idea that "every act of thinking has an effect" and how it would make sense for one to think of an "action" in the sense that it causes an effect. He uses the example of eating, which he calls "a good act." But it's not. When he goes on to talk about the "bad" effects of eating (heartburn, etc.), I was actually laughing. I mean, who is this guy to say that a good thing like eating would lead to a bad thing like heartburn? Is he implying that if we eat to alleviate an irritable stomach, we will inevitably suffer heartburn after? I think not. Descart is saying that there is a "necessary connection" between the actions we do and the things that happen to us. That is, we do what we do because our actions cause some effect in the world. And, in this case, that "effect" is the bad effects of heartburn. And that's just what Descart says. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off badly with a bad example of how a lot of bad behavior can happen when you get a bunch of different kinds of people together in the same room.  First we have the characters who get drunk off of booze without bothering to get a drink of water.  Then we have an older man who, because he can't keep from eating food all day, eats like he has cancer.  Next we have a woman who, after a few drinks, gets drunk and takes a bunch o pills and starts acting like a total retard.  I'm just getting started, though.  Here we have three different kinds  of people at a party.  One group, a bunch who are pretty much in their twenties, get a little too into it and start playing the field a little more.  The other group is a group of people who are in their thirties and early forties.  They are the ones who start making out with the men and acting like idiots.  After the thirtieth or so drink, this group starts to get drunker and more obnoxious, and at the party's end they start trying to force their way into the women's room so they can get drunk themselves.  All of these people are really obnoxious and bad  (except for the last group, who are the most responsible, but who are mostly in their forties and fifties.  That's a nice age group, but a lot less tolerant than their teen-agers and young adults.)  I don't want to make this sound like a bad novel (it's not), but it's really just the worst of what bad people can do together.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started to like this book, but it was just too boring.   It's as if this author has a problem with writing stories with character that have depth, but are too shallow to actually give much of a plot or a theme. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a first time novel, the author's first attempt at writing a story for a teen girl was quite good. Unfortunately, she couldn't do anything better. The first half of the novel is great, but the second half is very forgettable, with the characters not getting enough to do and not being very interesting, in my opinion. I wouldn't mind having this one, but I'm a little too busy writing reviews to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book. The main reason I was disappointed is that it was hard for me to imagine anything I'd actually read which would be so tedious and dull.  There are so many pages on the history of the Christian church which I could have skimmed, but couldn't help but keep reading to see what the point is and if the author's arguments hold water.  It wasn't worth it, because after the second or third paragraph I knew I'd been tricked.  If this book is good at writing, it is very bad at defending its points, and is almost always off-topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written by someone who was not even a child when her mother died. The language is so awful that it's difficult to read it, but it's the subject matter that really bothers me. She talks about how she was left "alone" at the funeral, how she didn't want to be in the casket, how the funeral director laughed at her because she didn?t want to see what was under the caskets, how her friends cried because she wasn?t there, etc. The book ends with a "featured article" in a women?s magazine about the book. What a waste of time! A woman is dead; the only thing she should want is for people to remember her as she really was, not as some version of herself she made up to make herself feel better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book.  It's a very poor and illogical exposition of the historical Jesus.  The whole premise is an attempt to make Jesus more popular and charismatic than he really was. The book starts off with a brief account of Jesus' life and the gospels, and then moves on to Jesus' death and resurrection. I'm not sure that Jesus was even supposed to be crucified, and there's no mention of the virgin birth.  And if Jesus was really resurrected after three days, why didn't he show up in any of the gazelle and peacock drawings from the New Testament?     The author's argument is that it's not enough that Jesus lived as a real historical figure.  He needs to become more popular because that makes him more accessible to the general public.  This isn't just a criticism of this book; it's a critique of a whole trend in contemporary Christianity.  Jesus is just a "reliable source" for most Christians, which is why people just claim to be Christians without actually believing anything that Jesus supposedly said.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished  The Baddest Man in the World by Chuck Palahniuk.   While I have enjoyed his other novels, including Fight Club and Naked Lunch, I was disappointed in this one.  His prose often veers into melodramatic and overwrought imagery.  As a result, he often fails to make his characters compelling or believable.  The most egregious example of this is a scene in which a young woman is raped by two men who force her to have intercourse with them.  While she screams and struggles, the men refuse to stop and eventually penetrate her vagina with a knife.  I had to force myself to finish reading it because it was so painfully over the top.  At least Palahnuuk's novels are entertaining.  In this one, they become downright painful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a big fan of the books of Jane Austen. I bought them in bulk and enjoyed every page. This book doesn't live up to the hype. I was disappointed because I've been wanting to read it for so long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't get past the fact that this is a story about a man trying to get the attention of a woman who is more attractive than him and failing miserably.  Why does this book exist?  And, if it is really about a guy who has no luck in wooing a woman, why did I spend the entire book listening to him whine about how he has to try so hard to get her attention? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just found out that this book is about an actual real person. So it's not just a "literary piece," or a biography, or a fictional re-telling.   She interviewed Dr. Robert Dicke, who has a real-life brain disease.  The interviews were done with Dickel in prison.  In one of the interviews, he says, "If the author wants to know how I see the world, I'll tell her. She could do with a little education on how things really work in the world."  That's what it sounds like to me.  If you want to know exactly how a "hard-headed scientist" sees the world and what kind of person he is, it sounds pretty good to me, even though I don't really know anything about the disease Dichel suffers from. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author was very clever. I was able to understand and follow his plot lines without having to go through the hard work of understanding Japanese.   I liked the characters, and found myself rooting for them to succeed in their goals. But at the same time, I found them all very, very annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time and money. The author has spent a large portion of the book explaining how women and men should interact in "normal" social situations without any further description. She says, for example, that men should be polite to women, but then spends the next four chapters explaining the various "wrong" things a man could say to a woman to get her fired. She goes on to say that if a man says, "You're a hot, pretty woman," a woman who is in an abusive relationship is obligated to say, "Oh, I'm a good girl. I don't want to hurt my husband, but I can't help it, because he's the most important person in my life." This book has zero relevance to the real world. It is basically a collection of things women have heard at one time or another, often times, without a second thought. I did not learn anything new from this book, although it did give me a headache.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, and I was left disappointed in a number of different ways.   First, the book's claim that all ancient religions, even pagan religions, are inherently harmful to the human race is a preposterous statement.  It is not true.  Second, the author relies on a variety of dubious sources: a bad history book, an anti-Semitic tract, and various Christian teachings.   Third, the subject matter is difficult and it is difficult to separate truth from fiction.  This makes it hard to decide whether the book is serious, satirical, or just a rambling piece of propaganda.  My answer would be that I was more disappointed in the book as a scholarly study than in the actual material it contains.  I am happy that the author made the effort to correct for some of the weaknesses in his research, but his conclusions are just as questionable as the materials he cites.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to find this new translation by Elizabeth A. Kostecki, and was so happy to find it in my local bookstore. Unfortunately, it is not good at all. The translation is terribly sloppily done. The story is unreadable and not especially engaging. It seems to be mostly about a young man who is unable to connect to his father because of his alcoholic father, who is often a violent drunk. The young man is a lonely loser who has a crush on a girl in his class, but she doesn't like him because he is always a loser. He is also obsessed with the girl's mother who is never there, so he keeps writing letters to her and hoping her mother will find him. The last paragraph is about the mother, and it makes me want to scream. In this final paragraph, the young man describes his father as "the most perfect man I ever met." This man is so good that "I'll take you to his house when I get out of this town," he says. "And then, you'll understand everything." What the young hero really means is "you can never leave me," as he is his entire life, even when he is not. But this man is not his father. He was abused by him, and now he is trying to be his father again. This is an absolutely horrifying idea, and if you can't tell it is terrible, then you will be in trouble for life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My parents bought this book for me after reading the reviews, but I just couldn't stomach the book. The characters were horrible. They made me feel so bad for the characters. I have had a difficult time with anger and self-confidence issues, and this book made me see it as a mental disorder. There was nothing positive to say about the character development either. I felt so bad at the end of the book that I didn't want to finish it, but now I am reading it again, and I can't believe how wrong I was about the book's characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only poorly written and written poorly, but it is poorly organized and poorly organized makes it seem as if the author had a clear agenda and was trying to use the book to promote it. As if a little research was not enough! The main thrust of the book is to attack free will, an idea that is not well supported in the science, and that may be true, but only if one is willing to ignore a lot of other good evidence that supports the idea of free will.  I thought it was odd that the author didn't go after other religious beliefs that are also based on beliefs in free will such as a belief in reincarnation, which is not supported by science either.  It would be interesting to see what sort of effect this book would have on those who have faith in reincarnational, free will and the afterlife. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure if the author had a political agenda or not. I was not sure what to make of it either. As a reader I had to turn pages and page over and over again because of the sheer number of bad ideas, half-baked ideas, and incoherent statements. I did not feel like the author was an expert on the subject. I don't know if he knew enough about the subject to write an expert's review but he seemed to be in a hurry. Overall, if you want to read a bad review about bad books, this is definitely the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished reading this book in one day and my mouth was completely dry after the book finished. It was so awful that I almost gave it a bad review, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. This is the sort of book that is intended to be a quick read, so it's hard to get excited about it until the last page. However, the author fails spectacularly. I can only recommend this book to those people who are interested in how bad bad books can be, but don't have a lot of time to read them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, which promises to give a complete history of the great American theater. However, I was left disappointed by the author's history of New York City, and disappointed also by the book's treatment of women and racial minorities. This history is a long way from being accurate, but it is at least informative.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried reading this book when I was a teenager, but found it so boring I put it down in frustration and went looking for something else to do.  This is the equivalent in this book: A group of teenage girls gather to talk about a movie in which a woman has to put on a ridiculous disguise to get into a ball game.  The group also tries to find a boy to date, and is unsuccessful.  They also talk about how boring everything is and how they want to move on to something else.  I don't know why I was even thinking about reading this, but I did, and the writing was awful, even for this book.  If you want to learn more about how bad people can become, or what you can do to stop it, read another bad book, but save this one for last. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that attempts to explain the life of a woman called "Polly" (who was a real person, not invented for the purposes of this book) is so far from the mark that I feel obliged to write a scathing review of it.  Polly was a very real woman. She was a seamstress and a church volunteer and a good, smart woman with an excellent sense of humor.  The author, however, attempts to paint her as a woman who lived in her own image, rather than in her husband's.  Her husband is portrayed as a "lovable but controlling monster" (emphasis mine) and Polly as a spoiled, self-absorbed little princess (I wish I had included this in the title of this review, but it seems like such a strange word to use to describe someone's father).  There is no attempt to give Polly any other role in the family.  A few times Polly even comments on the family, which the author tries to ignore as irrelevant (p. 45).  The authors attempt to explain how the other women, especially Polly's mother, can be so good-natured and supportive, but they just don't come across very well (p 49).  Although this book was recommended to me by a friend (who I liked very much, I must say), I'm still giving it only a 4/10 (it really didn't hold up too well). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A typical non-fiction work in a very broad genre such as "the war of American religions," The Last Days of God: The Christian Right and the War Over America is riddled with factual errors. For example, in describing the Protestant Reformation in America, the author states that in the first 50 years of the movement, "the churches were not organized for the primary purpose of preaching, preaching, and preaching." In fact, it was the Reformed churches that were organized for this purpose, and their churches in America continued to preach and preach into the nineteenth century. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is nothing good in this book.  It has several problems:  It is repetitive.  Many of the pages in the book read the same way.  The narrative often makes it seem as though the author's purpose is to explain his views.  There are several references to a religious leader who does nothing but talk and do nothing in his own time.  These references are almost always in the same sentence, so it is unclear whether they are valid references or not.  "He is the most successful of all American ministers," the author states,  "who has never given a sermon in a big church or given an annual sermon at a conference. He is a member of the American Historical Association, and he is an honorary member of numerous groups. He has done no public speaking on this matter, nor has he spoken to a large group of people in his office. He seems to do nothing but watch TV and eat potato chips."  "If he had written a book on his thoughts on the future of America and the world, he would probably have to include the names of several other leaders, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Henry Ford."  This kind of overuse of repetition is annoying because it seems to me that the author is not really trying to convey any new insight, but is just regurgitating the same information he has already been giving for years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very excited to finally read this book about the American Revolution.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as compelling as I hoped.  The narrative, written in the voice of a young man in Boston, is intriguing.  It also has some good lessons for young people, such as "Never let anyone take advantage of you," "Keep your mouth shut when you don't agree," "Don't listen to people who aren't your friends," and "Be true to yourself."  Unfortunately these lessons were all thrown out the window when the young man was caught trying to sell bootleg "Revolutionary" bootleg books and the man who wrote his biography became the hero of the book.  I'm not sure whether I like this person or not.  He's certainly interesting but doesn't seem to be a very good source of historical information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disaster.  In fact, it's almost a disaster in every way.  The beginning is full of bromides about how people like Mr. Harris, Mr. Davenport, Mr...
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, but they were dashed in the very first pages. It starts off as a good book about the impact of war and what the post-war generation can learn from it: "It was not easy, for instance, to find time to listen to World War II veterans discuss the events of 1944 or 1945. Their memories were so vivid and so full of emotion that it was impossible to listen without crying. But it was not hard for me to listen as I sat on the couch in my small bedroom. I was only thirteen, but it seemed that I had been in World War Two almost as long as the men who had gone before me." The rest of the book, however, was a mess, for which there is not much blame to go around. The first few chapters recount the experience of World War I, and then get to the war in Vietnam. While the Vietnam War is interesting from a historical point of view, it is not the central focus of the novel. Instead, the focus is on the experiences of World war II veterans, who are not given nearly the same amount of attention and detail that the Vietnam vets get. At the end of the day, I found the writing very stiff and the ideas very weak. That said, the fact that a book that is so bad can be so well-reviewed, and that so many people seem to like it, is very telling.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read through this entire collection of poetry and I've come to the conclusion that if these poems were not in the same genre as the earlier ones they'd just have to be read by someone else, as the style of the writing in each one doesn't flow well and the language lacks a certain coherence.   These poems are as different as they are.  While the first few, the ones which aren't quite as self-referential and more literary in feel, are all fairly successful, the later poems don't get that far.  Even the good poems are really just collections of personal musings on subjects like death, loneliness, and the futility of life.  If you enjoyed those earlier poems, you may enjoy the later ones, but you're going to be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are too many contradictions and inconsistencies to keep me from continuing. The book begins with a description of the first few days in Paris, but in the second chapter, he describes the French Revolution, in detail. This is confusing because in the last chapter he describes his first few months in America, and this time, he says he had just learned about the French revolution.   But in the first chapter, the description is about the first days in America.  So at one point, he makes it seem that his first days at the school were much different from his last days.  This seems to happen at least once in every book he writes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is terrible. Most of the quotes come out of context or, worse, they're just recycled from the preceding sections. I've read a lot of good books. I'm sure I could have done better. I gave up halfway through after reading a few pages, because the same mistakes kept happening. I also don't like the ending. It doesn't fit the rest of the book. I was looking forward to the last few chapters, but they were so bad that I gave it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read in my life.   It's so stupid.  It starts out well enough: A man is called out on a lie.  The lie?  He's a doctor.  As he's going to jail for a few days, he lies to his wife, saying he's a scientist.  But he's not.  His whole career has been a lie: He's not a doctor and he's never been a scientist.  He made up the part about being a physician for the government and getting away with it for over 30 years.  I thought this was pretty good.  He had the right idea at the time.  So he tells it, because he really doesn't want to go to jail.  If he could go back in time he'd be a better doctor. But, unfortunately, that never happens.  Maybe in another lifetime. But not now.  When he comes to jail, he has to tell the truth about himself.  This leads to a whole bunch of problems, the worst of which is that he has no memory of the lie: When he lies, he can't remember what he did.  Or why he did it. It's one of those "it's not like you remember" situations.  (No, I don't know what "not like you" means.) But when he's called out, he does remember.   So the prison guards come up with a plan to get him to remember the lie.   That plan involves going back to the past and getting him to lie about something that really happened in the present.  They have a way to go back and put on the wrong shoes and walk around in the wrong clothes.  How do you get a patient to remember something they didn't do?   (Well, we can't ask them.  We don't want them to remember.  And there are medical reasons why we can ask them, but that's another post.)  So they come up to the present and say, "Dr. Miller, we were having a problem with a patient last week, and we think we can help you.  Now, this patient has a serious allergy to grass.  Can you tell us how you feel about grass?  And how did you feel when you went in for this allergic reaction?"   They take the wrong patient.  Dr. Miller remembers everything.   When they go back into the past to fix
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very bad.  It's just full of contradictions and false claims. There is no good evidence that anyone who eats animal products is not prone to illness or obesity. People who believe they are healthy because of a plant based diet are simply delusional. The meat eaters are the most depressed people, they are the ones who want to kill animals and are the least likely to have a positive attitude about life. I just don't think that is possible and I believe in evolution.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so bad that it almost makes you want to give up on reading it.  As a linguist, I appreciate an academic book about the topic. I find it difficult to understand the author's interpretation of the original text, particularly because of the author having "a strong personal interest in the subject."  The author is trying to find the words to describe the "uniqueness" of American English, but he doesn't succeed.   The only words I can think of that come close are the word "vocal," and the author even uses this word in the context of the "coasting" of the English language.  It's impossible to believe that all of this is accidental. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not even sure this book deserves a 5 star rating, but here goes anyway: 1. The protagonist (and the narrator's alter ego) is a "typical" college dropout from "the wrong side of the tracks" (read: New York). 2. The plot is basically a series of excuses for what the protagonist did in the past. The book is a series about the protagonist's excuses for why she can't get a good job, her reasons for not getting a good relationship, her excuses for not living up to her own standards, her justification for not saving a drowning man and the justification for why her parents wouldn't understand her. I could keep going. 3. This book is full of stereotypes of black people in New York City. She's a "crack whore" who's constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She drinks, smokes and has an affair with every white guy she meets. She is constantly told by her white friends that she is dumb, but she never takes her white boyfriends seriously because she's too stupid to understand what she's really like. She has several black friends, but they never seem to have any respect for her. She "dates" a black boy who treats her like dirt and is abusive to her. 4. The character has a very bad experience at the hands of the police. This is the one thing in the book where I had the worst experience reading. I've seen police brutality in movies and tv shows, but this really happened to me. It was the most horrific and degrading thing I've ever experienced as a victim of police brutality. It made me wonder what kind of "police brutality" I would have to deal with as a black woman in New Orleans. I'm sure this part of the book is meant to make the reader think about the experience of black victims of police abuse in this city and what they have to go through to be believed. I think the book's message is that if a black girl is raped and she's able to report it, she is not believed. She should not be believed because her rapist is white and she is black. The author has to invent excuses for the protagonist to be able to say no to her rapist, to be unable to stand by his abuser, to not believe her. The narrative also perpetuates the myth that all black men are rapists and that all white men are the victims of black rape. 5. "No one ever talks about the black man
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the sort of thing that might be interesting, but the story is so unoriginal and trite that the book becomes a chore to read, no matter how hard you try to put yourself in the shoes of the characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book. I am going to try to enjoy it more now that I've read other books in the series. The idea of the character was intriguing enough, but it seemed that her main purpose was to give exposition for the other characters' actions. I also feel that the book took place too long between chapters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading through the new editions of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald since the 1980s. It always seemed too bad that the first printing of the book had such a disappointing cover.  After reading all of the new books that come out every year, it's a real tragedy that Fitzgerald is not remembered as a great writer.  I'm especially sad to hear that he never got credit for being a good writer. He was a great poet and an excellent writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really disliked this book. The author's constant use of "we," as if he was somehow a member of some mysterious elite or class, did not add any depth to the book at all. I just didn't care about him. He was annoying. I'm glad I didn't pick up his book. I'd have been much more likely to listen to him on the radio. (I'm pretty much an audiobook snob.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to reading this book because I really enjoyed the first. However, I did not enjoy the second.  It reads much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. Not because it was bad, but because of the way it tried to be smart while at the same time being stupid. This is the kind of book you read when your brain is already screaming at you to stop because it's getting in the way of your creativity. It was a slog to slog through to get to the good stuff (i.e. the stories, the characters, the worldbuilding, the characterization, etc.), but as I kept slogging, the stories got better and the characters became more real to me. Even though the prose is sometimes a bit sloppy (i would say at least 90% of the time), the writing itself is top notch. It's great stuff, just plain stupid at times.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book ever written. The characters are uninteresting, the plot is poorly developed, and the writing style is a complete mess.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For most of her life, I assumed that Ms. Lacey was a book reviewer. It took me some time to realize that she was probably a reviewer for the bad. Her reviews of poor books usually aren't just about the badness of the book's subject matter but rather the author's poor writing.   She claims to have read and enjoyed the original and the sequel.  She gives the original only three stars.  Unfortunately, it is one of the worst books she's ever read.  The prose is painfully bad.  There is very little story.  Ms. Larabee is a bit too quick to compare the characters' flaws to those of the heroes in her own books.  Some of the characters aren't even human (like some of the main characters of her own stories) and the plot is just too contrived.  But that's the only bad thing she's got about this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a complete failure for me. I was reading it to my daughter when I realized what a horrible piece of work it was. I got through three of the twenty-three chapters in about fifteen minutes, not much longer than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of the stuff about religion that seems to have bothered me in previous books got a lot less interesting in this one. For example, what would be the point of a God who only looks out for his own interests? He only cares about his own selfish needs? He would not help me out if I were in real trouble because he wants to be alone? Well, I don't think he even exists. But I guess that's just my view. The fact that he is part of a religion is really interesting and seems to be the source of his power. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a bad story about a girl, a young woman I admire. She was the best friend of a great man, so I wanted to like this story about her. Unfortunately, the writing was awful, the story was contrived, and the characters were flat and boring. She is a teenage girl, so there was no need for a lot of angst, and her relationships with boys didn't help her character at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The prose is sloppy, the plots are poorly executed, and the characters are poorly drawn. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a horrible attempt to take the basic ideas of Buddhism and inject them into a modern, Western context. In essence, they are presented in the same breath but the former has much more profound spiritual significance. In his attempt to connect Buddhism to Western society, this author takes concepts from the Dhamma, especially the five dhammas or spheres of existence, and tries to incorporate them into his worldview. He then uses these ideas to argue that "Buddhism is universalistic because it offers a framework through which human existence can be interpreted and experienced" (p. 8). He describes Buddhist practice as a series of "categories of thought and action" (pp. 9-10). The first category of thought he mentions is "the category of phenomena," in which he asserts that everything is dependent on something else. However, this category cannot be applied to phenomena because phenomena are always in the process of becoming dependent. Thus, it is meaningless to ask if a certain thing is dependent upon something else in the current moment. He also makes the mistake of applying a concept from the "dharmic view" to phenomena. This concept is related to a theory called the khandhas, which states that all phenomena in the universe are the product of a single "essence" of consciousness (p, 15). While there is definitely some truth in this claim (there is a single ultimate essence of consciousness in the Universe), it is not a Buddhist doctrine. On the contrary, the Buddha has always been clear that "There is no such thing as a single essence, no such as a plurality of essences" (MN 2.31). He claims that "the ultimate essence is void, without a subject, without existence" (Buddhist Canon, s.v. "essences"), "in other words, it does not possess self-nature" (ibid., s.vi. 2). It is worth noting that even though phenomena are dependent on some other phenomenon, they will not exist in the absence of that other phenomenon. In this sense, everything is the result of something else (or "causality") working in the background. The khandha concept in particular is just a philosophical way to describe the fact that some things are constantly changing. In the Buddha's words, "In the past, it was hot; in the future, it may become cold."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read.  It is full of self-contradictions and obvious plagiarism, and is a poor example of what a good book should be.  I had planned to give it a 3 star rating, but I kept wanting to put it down in disgust at the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've read in a long time.  It has a few good ideas, but the execution is sloppy and the writing is often poorly organized.  I've already read a dozen similar books on self-improvement.  The ideas are interesting, but don't stick.   I don't recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really disliked this book.  It is too detailed, too academic, and too dry.  This is very much a non-fiction book written by an academic.  I thought the book would be better if the author included personal anecdotes as well.  But since the anecdotes are also important and are the only thing that is included in this book, I found this book boring, academic, dry, and not very interesting.  Overall, this is a bad example of "non-fiction" and a bad introduction to the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and thought out. It gave me something new to think about that was a bit out of the ordinary. However, the book didn't explain the real origin of the "badass" as often as it tried to. It felt like it tried too hard to be "cool" about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book. It was a long time coming.  It's so long that I feel it would benefit greatly from being split into two halves (or three, if you want to be even-steven).   The first half of the book is a summary of the work of Robert Heinlein and the work done in the 50s by Theodore Sturgeon (in which the work is better but also more like the pulp novels of the 60s).  This second half is more about the "future history" genre in fiction that developed after the death of science fiction's heyday.  While the first half was written to look at the genre's glory days, this second half focuses more on its "sad but necessary" times.  Although there are a couple of interesting parts of the second half, I was left wanting a bit more.  Even if the first portion of the review was a bit of a let-down, the second portion is just too far into the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book for two primary reasons. The first is that it presents an opinionated "one-size-fits-all" approach to all things. Everything is either wrong or the "right" answer, with nothing in between. For example, one of the many "reasons" given by the "author" for the success of Christianity, and the "best" form of religion, is that God commanded that the earliest Jews "should go into the desert." (p. 9)  But, this "author," with his "authoritarian" view of the Bible, is the one who didn't go to the desert...   Another example is the "Christianity's best feature" of having no gods.  But God created the universe, not mankind....    What I dislike most about the book is that this author seems to believe that the way to understand anything is to "follow the authority" of some authority figure. This "authority" must be respected, while all other sources of knowledge are "inaccurate." I don't want to "disagree" with this "one" author, but it is a shame that he doesn't recognize that the "majority" are the "good guys." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so awful, I just had to write about it.  I loved the title - "The American Way of Death" - but this book is nothing like that.  It's about "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (I like the title, though).  If "The Bad" is about people who kill people, this book seems to focus on people who "kill people" but pretend it's for a "higher" purpose.  This is a very common theme in the history of the world, and "The Ugly," "The Great Wall" and "Braveheart" are just a few examples.  The entire thing is so depressing, I can't read more than a few pages before giving up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's all right in some ways, but the whole "people being turned into horses" thing is pretty unbelievable and I'd have a hard time taking it seriously.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so disappointed with this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favourite book of the summer is The Last Samurai: the Story of General Ushijima, a Japanese General Who Ended the War by Stretching His Arm Through the Abyss by Richard Louv (the book is the Japanese version).  It has a really interesting structure in that it is a history of a Japanese general who leads his forces to victory after a defeat at the Battle of Kosei against a powerful Chinese army. He has a daughter named Kaoru and his daughter is a hot girl who has the same name as his favorite TV character, Captain Yamato. I was looking forward to reading this book because I love the idea of a General leading his troops into a battle that results in victory, yet being disappointed by what he finds when he takes his forces back to Japan.  I got my copy of the book in the mail at the end of August, but couldn't wait to finish it and had to rush it to the store.  The book is written in a style that is easy to read and is also well done. Unfortunately, as soon as you start to focus on the plot, you quickly lose interest and start to question the relevance of the plot to the plot. There is an endless stream of people that are introduced as having some connection to the characters or to the overall story, but they aren't brought up again, which results in a lot of redundant information. There are a couple of really good historical anecdotes that I found very interesting, but this book could have used more of the historical information it is supposed to be using. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book about 30 years after it was written.  It wasn't too bad.  I'm glad I got it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when I was looking for a good mystery story. I was disappointed that it turned out to be the same old same old. I've been burned a few times by those books, but this one left me feeling cheated. I'm disappointed in the plot and characters as well. I wanted to like them, but I couldn't. There's no sense of danger in the story. The protagonist gets off the ferry in New York only to run into a stranger at the train station. I didn't understand why she was there or what her intentions were. She just appeared out of thin air, didn't say a word, and then disappeared again. It made no sense. There was no danger. It's like some paranormal detective show, except they all disappeared, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book I was looking forward to reading but found very disappointing. I was hoping for a fascinating examination of the ways women have come to occupy the space occupied by men in American society.  Unfortunately, this is anything but.  The focus is almost exclusively on women as victims and victims only.  What about men?  And what about men who don't fit into the traditional mold of the male?  Why can't men do what women do?  The answer is never given. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, the title: "The Case Against God."  It is a book that begins with the claim that "God is dead." It then claims that the existence of God is incompatible with the scientific worldview of the modern world.  The book is full of this sort of claim. It begins by saying "We should not worship nature.  We should worship our gods."  This is a common trope in religious apologetics  It claims that we should worship only the "god" of the Bible.  But, of course, "the God of the Torah" has little in common with "the god of the Qur'an."  The author then tries to make his argument more appealing by saying that God can help us if we seek him and trust in him. He also says that if we do not seek him, then God is useless. The book contains many interesting examples of this.  This chapter contains the following paragraph: "God cannot help a man who is not seeking him.  God is good.  If you do not ask for his help, he cannot help you."  In the same chapter, the author says, "I was struck dumb by the idea that I needed to believe in a higher power to survive.  Why would I need a higher being to survive if he is so powerful as to be able to save anyone who tries to do so on his own?  If I need help, then it is a failure of character.  I must trust in my own ability to survive and to find answers to life's problems.  All the answers I need are available to me right now, within my own soul.  There are no higher powers who are somehow waiting for me.  They are my family, friends, coworkers, and teachers.  And they are all willing to answer all of my questions and help me find answers even if they don't believe in God."   If these people did not trust in the existence and powers of a higher supernatural being to save them, then they have no reason to do that.  It would not seem strange to do just that in a world without a higher authority to come along.  In fact, it would seem to be much more rational than continuing to follow a higher divine being to the very end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a lot of problems. First, there are some obvious spelling and grammar errors. Second, the narrative is poorly structured. The authors seem to think that because the characters live in a particular region that their behavior is a result of local traditions and customs. But they rarely think about the effects that this has on the characters. For example, the protagonist has a terrible memory, but he never mentions the memory to anybody because it doesn't seem to make any difference to him. Even worse, the book goes on at great length about a girl he met years ago that had been sexually abused as a child by her family's doctor. I don't see why this matters in any way, and it is almost insulting for the authors to make it so prominent. It is simply the kind of thing that might happen in a remote area and never get noticed or discussed. And the fact that the author takes so much time to describe the doctor's relationship with her child as if it were something interesting to mention is just bad writing and an unnecessary distraction. If there are any redeeming qualities to the book, they are found in the prose, and that is all it ever is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a little slow at times, but not much. There is a lot of talk about the American education system and how it's bad.  I was very surprised to find out that teachers are supposed to be the best teachers.  It really bothers me when authors who don't have a lot experience are quoted as having it nailed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book reads like a long, poorly researched report. It is so full of mistakes, so many contradictory facts, that it reads as a collection of opinion rather than fact. The story follows three different protagonists:  A young, ambitious, and naive man. He is the president of a company. His father was the CEO, and he has had some success, but not as much as he wants. He wants to take over the company.  A well-respected and experienced senior executive. He has been in many high-profile situations and has had his share of setbacks. He isn't sure whether he wants to leave his job.  An old, wise, and experienced business veteran. He runs a successful company and is in his eighties.  I really enjoyed this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book. I read most of the first two books of the original series and found them disappointing and not worth the effort. However, after rereading them, I realized that this one was just so bad.   It's an exercise in making fun of the genre and the fact that people will read the same novel over and over again.  It has all the clichés you could want from a story that was once considered the gold standard of the series.  This book was written at the height of the "slipstream" craze that took over the genre in the late seventies.  Slipstream is the idea that authors write in a literary style that is different from the standard genre novels and that this style helps the reader understand the story.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work.  The style is too literary, with long sentences and long paragraphs, and the plot and characters are so terrible that readers will never get a real understanding of the story or the characters.  I have no sympathy for the authors here, because they basically wrote a poorly written sloppily done story. They made a very poor choice about what type of story they wanted to tell, and they didn't know that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think that this book is a pretty big waste of time.  This book claims to explain and analyze one of the most famous works of literature.  Yet it has only one significant feature that really makes this book worthless:  This is a biographical work about the author of the Lord of the Flies, which I have never read.  It is the only thing the author knows about.  The only thing he knows about the book is what it says about him in the book.  There is nothing to be learned about his character from this book. This is, of course, in the interest of maintaining the fiction.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first 5/6 pages are so poorly written that I didn't even know where I was going with the book.    What does he mean when he talks about how people have always lied, that a single lie will never be proven to be false?  This is exactly the same story he's used before to justify everything he does to people.  The book also takes a bizarre turn at the end, where he goes from calling people "bad" to saying that bad things happen to good people because they deserve it.  I am very uncomfortable reading this book, because I have the same feelings and biases as the author, and I've known people who have done horrible things and regretted it later.  But to write a book that tries to say good things about people who do terrible things?  I was thoroughly disgusted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book at least once a year since my early teens.  I never got around to it until now.  It is about the author's experience as a military pilot in the Korean War.  The story is told by the pilot's daughter who was very involved in her dad's career.  When I say military, I mean the military side of the Korean conflict.  This isn't a book about the war.    It's more about piloting.  In my opinion, the book is overrated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem is that this book was written by a person who has no knowledge of women's history, who has taken a lot of other non-fiction books and turned them into "facts." The result is that the author's opinions and interpretations are presented as factual facts. The book is very good for a women's studies course, as an introduction to the subject, but the author should have known that the women who wrote this book were not the only ones who wrote it. The problem with the book is that it doesn't cover the main points that were put forth in other historical women's histories, but instead focuses on the opinions and arguments of a very few people who either wrote or were influenced by the other historical sources.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is good, the research on the historical issues is good. There's a decent amount of background on the founding fathers. I was not blown away by anything in the book, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about how the Founding Fathers came about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book is bad. It is full of errors of fact and logic, and its primary goal is to discredit feminism by attacking the "feminist agenda" to "impose women's rights and privileges upon all men and children in society."  For example, she claims that feminism is "the belief that women should have the right to vote and have equal opportunities in all areas of life."  This is demonstrably false.  She also says that the women's suffrage movement was "founded on the myth that men and women are innately equal in every way."  Here, too, the claim is demonstrable falsity.  It was a hoax.  In the late 19th century, American feminists tried to pass a law to give women the vote (it failed).  It never had a chance, partly because it was based on a lie.  Another hoax was the idea that women are naturally better than men at math.  The idea originated in 1882, when it was widely believed that women had more "innate aptitude" for math and science.  There is no evidence that this idea gained any traction.  But what is interesting is that these two claims are at the center of this book.  This book is supposed to show that feminists are motivated by hatred of men, so it is hard to believe that the authors are serious about these claims.  What is even harder to believe is that the claims about feminism are not true.  I would hope that they could be proven false by an objective source.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished this book two years ago but still haven't read it, and I can't stop thinking about it.   While I appreciate the work of the original author, I felt this book was just too personal and had too many factual errors to be worth the time it took me to go through it all.  The story itself is intriguing but the book itself just makes me want to put the book down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked the premise that a little boy must be able to handle a grown man's bad habits and get around it, but I was disappointed by the book. In the book, the grown man, Tom, shows the little boy his collection of knives and other sharp objects, and the little one complains that he can't use them because of his "bad habits." The problem is that the boy never takes the collection seriously. Instead, he just plays around with it.  I can understand the boy being afraid of getting hurt when Tom tries to hurt himself, but Tom is so clumsy that it's easy for the boy to get around his knife-holding problem. The most frustrating aspect is the fact that he doesn't seem to recognize that he's actually harming his best friend, even when the boy threatens to go on a suicide spree if Tom doesn't stop. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. I don't get it. I really loved these books, but they have one or more flaws. First, the "I am such a fan that it hurts to read this book" thing that a lot of the fans seem to be upset about in this one is silly. I mean, if anything, it was a good thing, because that made the book better. I'm not going to be that guy. Second, there were several things in this book that just didn't make sense. There was a scene with a penguin, who I'm assuming was supposed to be an evil villain, that made no sense at all. There were also a lot more plot holes than in the previous books, and there wasn't enough time in the book to explain them. It was kind of like watching an episode of "The Twilight Zone" at a restaurant.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was awful!    The author tries to be cute but her writing is clunky, and she's never that clever or witty.   She even has a couple of spelling errors.  For example, in describing the last time she visited a place, she says "the place had been in my family for generations.  But I wasn't going to remember it that way."   I'm sure her family still calls the place "the house," but I wouldn't want her to use that word when referring to it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poor representation of the work of an interesting and well-respected author.   It's mostly a mishmash of ideas from the '70s, '80s, and '90s; and it's obvious that the author has read, or at least watched, a lot of TV shows and films that were popular during those eras.  The plot itself feels more like a re-run, and the characters feel like archetypes that are lifted from an episode of The Cosby Show. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The novel is well written in the vein of a good thriller. The premise is intriguing. However, it takes a few chapters to get going and the character interactions are predictable. This novel is also heavy on the religious references and the religious overtones really bog down the novel. Overall, I was disappointed in this novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book, but couldn't bring myself to finish it. This is the third book of The Five People You Meet in Heaven by William Gaddis, but this time I found it wanting. Not because of anything that happens in the book. The plot is solid and the characters are well written. But I found that the writing fell a little flat at times, particularly in the last third of the book when we finally meet God. He comes off as pompous and self-important, to the point that it's almost painful to have him as a character. This doesn't happen much in the other three books by Gaddiss; instead, he gets more fleshed out and more interesting. I do find it a shame that he doesn't get to be the hero in his own book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started reading this book in December, 2015. I am in the middle of a long running book review series and this book fell short in the main plot line of my series.   The characters were interesting enough, especially for their time period, but there was a major lack of action or conflict throughout the book.  It is a pity that the author has made such an attempt at creating this world that it is now ruined because of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found that I was really enjoying  The Last Lecture    but I couldn't help but feel that it was missing something.   In my opinion, what the author should have done is write a much better book.  In addition to being a book on religion,  The  Last Lectures   has a more general discussion on the nature of morality.  I agree that it is easy to forget that even the most sophisticated religious doctrines have moral implications, and so I was glad that  The? Last  Lecture?   was published at this time of increasing interest in the nature and origin of morality as an important moral topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I have mentioned in other reviews, I don't find the writing in this book that bad, but I also don't appreciate how it is presented as if it is an unbiased and objective account of the author's experiences at the end of the Cold War. Instead, it is all about the author and his views, and at times it seems as if the book is written by a former member of the Kennedy administration and the Vietnam war, which may be the point, but it just isn't very compelling reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was just another rehash of the same "the devil and a nun" crap from the 1970s.  Again, I've just been rereading some of the other books by this same author.  I was hoping for a novelized version of some of his previous work.  It was the same old stuff.  He doesn't just ignore religious dogma in a secular context, he also makes fun of it.  One thing the previous books have in common is that the characters are all basically villains and there's really no development.  This one, though, has a group of people who all seem to hate each other and hate religious dogma and who spend a lot of time trying to get others to join in their crusade against the devil.  The story focuses on an older nun and a younger monk who seem to have a bad grudge against each other.  Neither character develops and neither gets any development.  It makes for an interesting story with a few interesting characters.  Unfortunately, the book suffers from a bad writing style and the characters come across as just cardboard cut-outs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book hoping that it would be a good study aid.  While it may seem like a good choice for a general student's reference work,  the book does not live up to the hype.  The authors attempt to present the most widely accepted theory concerning the cause of epilepsy with the fewest assumptions.  In fact, they are so uneducated and ignorant as to be laughable.  As far as I am concerned, there is absolutely no good reason to believe that seizures are caused by a brain disease.  Rather, I think that epilepsy is an unfortunate byproduct of human development. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is absolutely awful.  The main character, Mina, does not know how to read and thinks that her classmates are stupid and stupid things can only happen in fairy tales.  Her main teacher, Ms. Z, is a great teacher with an excellent track record but because of Mina's lack of reading ability, Ms Z's class has been canceled and she is now stuck with Mina and Ms. M..   Mina is constantly bullied at school and Ms Z spends the entire time trying to get Mina to read but Mina refuses.  Ms Z and Ms M. teach Mina how to say no to Mr. A (the creepy old man at the library) but when Mr. O comes to town (as a result of M/Ms. Z and M/Mina's prank) Mina decides not to go because Mr.O is creepy and Mr.A will hurt Mina.  M/S Mina wants to be a super hero but M/O can only tell her how bad she wants it so she stays in M/SO Mina doesn't like Mr. F.  Mr.F is a bad teacher because he yells at kids and has a bad temper and does not take good care of M.  He makes her do her homework because he "has to."  Ms F does not care what Mina thinks and always tells Mina that she is the smart one and not M/F.  Once M/MOF, M/E, M.I.A., and M.T. are gone Mr.M. is the only other teacher that Mina has ever been around.  Unfortunately, Ms M is so stupid and full of herself that Mr. M is able to use his wisdom to manipulate M/SI.  So far, MIA/SI is the worst teacher in the book.  It is sad how people can't handle the fact that M/Ia has the power to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I thought it would be a fun read. I found that it wasn't even close to that.   The writing was slow, confusing, and didn't make much sense. The character development was so-so, as well.  All I really wanted to get from this book was some sort of information on how to make my own homemade bread, but I'm not sure I ever really got it. Maybe I'll just go and buy some flour for my dough machine, which has a kneading function.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains many misconceptions about the Middle East, which lead the author to miss the larger picture. He says "the world is becoming more Islamic" but fails to mention that this is a process in progress, with the number of Islamic countries growing as well as those remaining secular. He also says, "For many years the Middle Eastern governments and leaders seemed to have lost the ability to understand the very real threat of militant Islam," but as he goes on to explain, all he actually shows is that most Muslim governments are not "willing or able" to deal with it, which is not an argument against all militant Islamic movements, but it does suggest that the problem can't be solved by government alone. He complains about the failure of Muslim countries to reform themselves, but fails not to mention the many Muslim countries in the West that have reformed from the West, which means that Muslims are not the ones who need to reform. And it's not just the Muslim world where this is true. The Jewish state of Israel has also made some strides toward reform. While I agree that there are some good elements in Israel's system (education, health care, social security), I can't help but wonder if some of the problems of the Israeli system come from the very fact that its government is dominated by right wingers. It's certainly not the only government in the world, but this might be one of the reasons why it is not the greatest democracy in the region. He criticizes the US for its lack of leadership in the Middle east, but his main point seems to be that the US is too passive and too preoccupied with internal problems to take the lead in the Arab world. He even complains about what he calls the "Islamophobia" of certain American politicians. But here he is praising a country that has been accused of murdering its own citizens for being Christian and criticizing its human rights record without making the slightest reference to the country's oppression of Christians and Jews.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books that is great for the sake of being great but is absolutely terrible when it is actually written.  The first 200 pages are wonderful. The second half is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate the whole premise of this book. I mean, we know that there is no such thing as "realistic" human beings. We know that people's "souls" are not their bodies, we can't read other people's minds, etc. I get it. I am a rationalist at heart and hate all of the irrational nonsense that goes along with religion. It can be fascinating for a short while, but after a while it gets really tiresome.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did enjoy this book, but it didn't leave a lot of impression on me. While the idea is interesting and the main characters are engaging, I didn't really feel like they were that interesting in the way that a lot other good books tend to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're a fan of the Harry Potter series, you'll definitely enjoy this book. However, like so many books written by fans, it suffers from over-emphasizing the romance elements and leaving out the plot development that would have made it more compelling. I found the romance extremely annoying, and didn't want to read any further. It was clear to me that Rowling didn't care about the plot, and just wanted to please herself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to agree with the other reviewers that this book is bad.   The narrator's accent is very awkward and the book sounds very amateurish, which is really not a good sign.  He also fails to understand much of what the characters are saying, sometimes just pausing to laugh or look surprised when they are said.  The characters are all very unlikable, which I am fine with (at least until the last chapter when they all come together and start to make sense).  The story is very weak; there isn't even enough to be interesting about the main characters.  I guess it's just a bad translation job, which will inevitably lead to a bad novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started reading this book hoping for something different.  It certainly did not deliver.  I was expecting some fun writing from a former atheist. Instead, I was forced to sit through a lecture on the scientific method, and how to think about things like whether God exists and if so, how much He might like me.  The book was written for the general public.  As such, the content is clearly meant for a general audience, not the scientifically-inclined person.  At one point, the author tells a story about being in a bookstore, where the books on the shelves are divided by topic.  She suggests that she and her fellow scientists look for books that would appeal to everyone, and she cites one of those books as an example.  When the author explains that the book is really an insult to the reader, she admits, "It's a pity we can't all agree on what should be on the best list."  When that book is the best-selling reference book on science, that's the real insult.  (As the atheist in my house joked, "What did she read?") 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book not because I wanted to learn about the Civil War, but because I am interested in writing about history and I am finding that most of the books on writing that I've read are very bad. This book is worse than most of them. The writing is sloppily written, the arguments are simplistic, and the examples that are used are all either inaccurate or are given in a way that makes the example seem more plausible than it really is. For example, a character is described as " a man from New York" who is " very good " at " reading " an article in the paper about an incident in the Civil war.    The " article " he was reading was about how a farmer from Connecticut " came up with some " really  really  cool " ideas about the war.    " He was from the north "   (which is supposed to be the part of the United States that was in favor of the Union.)   It is unclear how exactly this incident is supposed ot be related to the Civil  War   and the author doesn't make it very clear   whether he thinks it is relevant at all or not. The character is also described as being "from the south"   who is said to be " very bad " at reading.   Again, it isn't clear exactly which part of New York or Connecticut is supposed  to be used as a stand in for the South.  In other cases, it is unclear where the idea   is supposed by the writer to come from.  Sometimes the argument is   vague.  For example:  " A writer I knew who wrote for the National Review once said that he didn't like to be quoted in the press because the media doesn't like him.  He was right.  I am sure some people dislike him  because of his books, but they are not the people he wants quoted.  He wants them  to quote him  even if they don't like his books.  So, to quote the writer, they have the right to quote  him   even  if they dislike  him. "  So   it is clear to me  that the writer has no idea what  he is talking about when he makes these claims .  Maybe the writer is  trying to be ironic. I am not sure I buy this argument.  If  the "author" is trying to say that he is being
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first two chapters and thought the plot was interesting.   Then I began reading the third and fourth and was confused.  There are no clues and no clue. The plot is a complete mystery with no hint that the bad guys would be motivated by anything but their own self-interest.  Also, a large chunk of the characters have a tendency to become useless in the end.  I found it interesting how the protagonist used to be a spy in the Soviet Army. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading this book by a Christian apologist.  It is full of bad reasoning and is full with a large amount of unsupported assertions.  I think that a lot of the reasons that are offered are bogus or just plain wrong.  The author, who claims to be a professor of philosophy, writes at length about how atheism is the worst thing to happen to human beings in the last 2,000 years, yet is very vague on exactly what that means.  This is not how philosophy is supposed to work.  There are many philosophical positions and even more philosophical approaches to them.  What he says is just not true.  He talks about "Godless Humanism", but this is a vague term.  In his view, there are only a few forms of atheistic thought.  While it sounds very nice, it is just a lack of a more specific label.  Atheism is bad? No, atheism is good.  Humanism is good? No.  Buddhism is good? No. This is where the "bad" part of his reasoning really comes in.  Here is a good, succinct definition of humanism: "The belief in human responsibility for the world and for its good"    So if atheism is bad and humanism is even worse, what is the "good" thing?  I really don't know.  But I sure would like to know! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was so full of bad information about how the Soviet Union was so much better than the US and its allies that it's laughable.  At one point, the authors note the difference between the amount of people in the US who think the government of the US is more of a totalitarian system and those in the Soviet military.  They say that the US military is not a "totalitarian" system.  Yet when you put these two groups on the same battlefield with the same weapons, the US gets completely destroyed.  That's a total joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in a very short period of time and felt very cheated.    The author seems to have the impression that you should have sex whenever possible.  A few times in the book I felt the author was telling me to go out and "have sex" as though it was a positive thing.  That it would improve my marriage.  I would have to disagree.  Sex is an integral part of my marriage and I don't like to have sex in the middle of the night.  It makes the next few hours pretty hectic.  The book suggests that this will make my wife happy.  But then she does the same thing.   She takes a lot of pills.  She has sex in an inappropriate situation.  She does it several times a week.  So she is getting more and more out of the relationship and the book recommends that she should just cut back.  This book tells me to stop "doing" sex because it doesn't work.  For God's sake, what's wrong with her not sleeping with me and her "doing it" instead?  And for God's sakes, I don,t want to be with her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book. I'm an average reader and I am generally able to put down a good book, especially one that I've enjoyed. This book wasn't even very good. The writing style was very poor. The chapters didn't flow as smoothly as I would like, and there were numerous spelling and grammatical errors. While I don't necessarily recommend the book to other people, I think it is a good example of what not to do as a reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been looking for a good book about life as a young gay male that doesn't make me feel ashamed, like many books do.  This one isn't that.   He has a good sense of humor and a way of telling a story that is accessible.  I really like how he includes historical information, such as the use of sodomy laws in the nineteenth century. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise is interesting. We're in a time of war and there's a war on drugs. We learn that drug trafficking is a very efficient way to finance the war, and is one reason why it has been so successful. It's good to see the war on terrorism, but this book is so filled with factual errors that I'll have to skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have just completed   (and enjoyed)    the fourth and final   of the series written by Peter V. Brett.  I was not expecting a fourth installment and did not think the fifth would occur.  In this one, we learn about  the family of the female protagonist (and it is a family, at least one very dysfunctional one).  I did not enjoy this new information and was disappointed at the way the book ended.  We were treated to a few more scenes of the family's turmoil and a bit more about the girl's personal life, but  the main plot of the book had been spoiled.  The series was supposed to tell us more about them and their personal lives, but it did not.  There are two possible explanations for this.  First, Brett may have just been tired of writing about this group of people, but the writing was not all that good either.  This could have just come from having to write about these people for a long time.  Alternatively, Brett is just writing out of boredom and not caring about the characters and story line.  Either way, this one was a let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I had to rate this book one star, I would say the only thing it has going for it is its author's enthusiasm for his book. If that's all it had, I'd rate it less than three stars, but the book's many flaws outweigh the positive:  First, there's this sentence:  I don't know what this book says about homosexuality, but it isn't very good about it either.  I'm sure that's the intention, but in the course of explaining how it came about, he gives away a few secrets:  There are a lot of very old stories about homosexuals trying to get out of being gay.  There were, after all, homosexuals among the ancient Greeks and Romans, though they were probably very rare.  The Roman writers didn't mention anyone who was "transgendered" or was "effeminate."  We know from modern books that some people in the Middle Ages felt they were "transsexual."  But these stories are obviously much older than the first recorded instances of homosexuality in the Christian era.  (The "gay" stories in Leviticus seem to have originated with the Romans, not the Jews.)  What does this book mean to anyone who's "out" as homosexual?  It's just an excuse to claim that all gays, whatever their sexual practices, want to be heterosexuals.  And that's an insult to all gays who do want to stay gay.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was too slow and lacked all sense of urgency and urgency would have made it so much better. It felt like the author was just doing a survey of the internet and coming up with some random ideas that sounded good, but were just not right for the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have now read this book three times, and each time I found the characters and the story to be less than compelling.  In particular, I found her character, Mr. Karp, to be irritating and uninteresting.  I found him to be very self-absorbed and insensitive to others.  His arrogance and lack of empathy makes him seem very much like a 'bad man' as the author puts it.  The other characters are equally uninteresting and lack any depth.   At least, I hope they don't take up any more than half the pages.  Even worse, it seems that all the authors are afraid to try new things because they're afraid they won't be able to write well.  That's a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't remember when I started reading a good nonfiction book about the history of a certain American institution. I enjoyed it so much, however, that I gave up reading the other books that came after it.  This book is no exception.  Instead of providing a nuanced and interesting analysis of how the United States became the most powerful, influential, and popular country in the world, it presents a simplistic one-sided story about how it became that way.  It presents a version of history that has no historical value and is ahistorical.  The authors write about how the government was formed, how the Constitution was written, and how the Civil War was fought (which is quite wrong).  They then discuss how "individuals" took over the government and how this led to the current crisis.  They do a decent job of distilling this complicated event down to a simple story, but they fail to provide a nuanced analysis of why this particular version of the United State is as powerful, as powerful as it is.  I really hope that they do an honest and accurate analysis of history and the causes and effect of the events that led to this country becoming as powerful and influential as it does today, but this particular book has more problems than it does solutions.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As much as I enjoy reading and writing books on history,   I was very disappointed  by   The Last Lion .    Although this was written about Queen Victoria, who was a very popular figure in Britain,  it was not written by someone who knew the Queen very well.   Instead, it was written by a  historian who had spent little time with her and had limited access to her  correspondence. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that this book is written by someone with absolutely no idea about how to write a book.  The characters are flat and poorly developed.  Each one is presented as if they are in love with the other and need to be saved at all costs.  In every one of these situations, the "saved" is either very naïve and/or has some sort of personal flaw.  Then, they're dumped by the other.  It's as if the authors were so focused on the "bad guy" that they neglected the "good guy" who is actually a good guy.  This is not good writing, it's writing by a non-writer.  I don't know if I'd recommend this to a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book at a local library.  I was intrigued and read the back cover.  The cover said, "This book contains over 500 words I can't say."  There was only a few that I couldn't use (like the words "bisexual," "queer," and "biological").  I could also tell this was a work of fiction from the cover.      In summary, this book is written by a person with a disability.  It is not a very good book.  Instead, it is a poor excuse for a novel that was written by someone who should have known better.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is my first book by someone other than Stephenie Meyer.  I had heard of her before I'd read any of her books.  The first one she had done, "Twilight," was an instant classic for me.  It's pretty good, but doesn't quite have the magic that "Twilights" had.  This one, though, seems less exciting.  There's the same generic plot and characters, and it seems more like a rehash of past stories than anything that will really change your life.  Maybe that's what Meyer wants -- the same old stories in a new format.  A good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not teach the essential knowledge one needs to master a subject, but rather the theory of teaching. The book is full of the sort of "how-to" wisdom that has been available to teachers for the past 30-40 years and still is: use your time wisely, work hard, and work smart. The authors do a fine job of outlining the theoretical, but the practical (and most effective) lessons they provide are not well explained.  For example,  The book concludes with an excellent section on "The Ten Steps to Effective Classroom Management".   Although the authors claim that the 10 steps is the best advice available, the practicality of implementing them is questionable.   The "step" list is very subjective and it appears the authors used "rule of thumb" information from other textbooks in their "steps."  Also, as the authors admit,  There are times that you need to let go of your rigid sense of rules and expectations, and do things that are more in the spirit of the kids.  In other words, be a good teacher, not a good manager.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book a bad review in hopes that some of the positive reviews might sway me to pick it up.  Unfortunately, I found that the only positive thing about the book was that it gave a very good, albeit short, overview of some of our country's most troubling and misunderstood policies: the War on Drugs, "No Child Left Behind," "No Welfare for Criminals," "Racism without Racists," and so on.  The bad things?  It was too wordy.  It made no attempt to engage with the subjects it covered.   It got into too many details and tried to explain them in too many ways.  And it didn't give a positive analysis of "No Children Left Behind."  In sum,   If you want to find the worst government program in the last century, I would give this book the worst review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an embarrassment. It is the equivalent of a dog's head on a pike in a garden of good books, or a book with an unreadable cover that will eventually be discarded. If you ever find yourself tempted to buy this book, just say, "No thanks, I'll pass."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book and read it through on my way to work the next day. I was disappointed that it didn't contain the information I was looking for.  My interest is in the writing process and how it differs from writing a conventional book, but I don't think I've ever seen an author so clearly demonstrate the problems with that approach.  The author clearly wants to be a "writer" but fails at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's been a long time since I read a book about the paranormal, and I've had a couple in the past year or so. This one really took the cake in terms of bad writing and bad information. The most annoying thing in the book is that the author claims that the FBI, with all its resources and training, had no clue as to what he was talking about. I've heard it before, and it's an outright lie. This guy is a serial fraud and a phony, and his book is a blatant attempt to sell more books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is weak and, unfortunately, the protagonist, who is portrayed as weak and naive, is often forced into situations where he is forced to do things that end in tragedy.  However, the plot twists are clever and the characters are interesting.  This is definitely a book that I will keep on my reading list.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a huge fan of thrillers but this one managed to stay on my attention, even through a bad ending. It had all the elements I love about this type of fiction: romance, suspense, and a little bit of science, although it's not really a science book. As much as I was hoping for a more complex portrayal of aliens than "we're aliens and we think we're good" and "our civilization is better than our own", it comes off as too much of a simple plot device.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book.   My main problem was with the use of a fictional character.  She is a sociopathic woman who would rather cause misery to others than actually make things better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A horrible book about children.  The entire book is about how important they are and how they're the reason the human race exists.  It starts with "I am the way I am because I am made of pure love" (as if love were a biological attribute).  It goes on to describe how each generation has "improved" on the generation that came before.  These things make no sense because they're made up out of whole cloth.  They're made out of "myth, prejudice, and lies."  There are two things about love that make perfect sense: 1) the idea that "it is in the child's nature" to be the way they are.  2) that if you love someone too much you are going to cause them to be like you.  For someone with the power to make someone like them, this is the absolute worst thing you could possibly do.  So that's what the book does: it makes up stories about how babies have "improvements" and that if babies had "improvement" they wouldn't be as unlovable as they are now.   But these stories are completely false and made up in order to promote the book.  We learn that babies should be "caring and warm and soft and sweet" because that's how babies are made.  In actuality, babies aren't really all that different from adult humans.  Their brains haven't evolved yet and they're pretty much like every other species of animal.  I know the author is attempting to promote this concept, but the fact that it's so obviously not true means it doesn't work.  If babies could be made loving and caring and "soft and sweet," we'd be living in an entirely different planet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book and it has a lot of useful information and is well written. However, it does not address many common concerns and I'm sure there will be plenty of others who will have similar issues. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My impression of the book is that the author's intention is good but his execution is poor. He tries to address the problems that many people have in the Church and fails to do so. In the end, it seems he has become frustrated with his inability to convince people that the Church is not only true but also that its doctrines are more important than its policies. That's a shame because I had high hopes that this book could be one of the first to change my mind about the Church. Unfortunately, it doesn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so sick of all the crap that gets published.  The only reason I read this book is that I had a friend who loves "The Great Gatsby" (no offense, Mr. Fitzgerald).  This book was so bad, it made me want to skip all the other Fitzgerald books I have read.  Unfortunately, Fitzgerald's "Gatsby," which I haven't read (although it might be a good idea) is still considered by many to be one of the greatest works of literature of the 20th century.  This is the last thing I wanted to read, since I hate this genre so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this book.  I've seen so many good reviews about this book that I decided to purchase it.  There are many excellent reviews.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy reading this book, but I will not give up on reading it. I like to read nonfiction about other people's ideas and thoughts.  This book is a combination of both.  Some of the concepts are interesting, but the execution is poor.  For example, the "cure" he gives for obsessive compulsive disorder is too extreme.  Other concepts, such as self-improvement, are also impractical.  It makes me wonder if he is a very bad writer.  In other places, the ideas seem more practical than original. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing of this book is terrible, with a particularly unfortunate tendency to start sentences with "The next..."   A more logical beginning would be something like "The protagonist begins..." and ending with "She becomes..." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book after reading about it on Goodreads. I thought it was a good read but found it quite dry. The characters were also flat.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've tried and failed to read this.   The narrator's pronunciation of the words is so bad that I often found myself trying to spell the names.  It's like she is so much better at spelling the words in books like this that she's decided to just stick with the standard form of each word in her books.  But she's awful at that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and loved it. I loved how it was an honest look at someone who is in a terrible relationship and tries every possible way to make that relationship better and how the book was full of self-reflection and acceptance. It was great but the author's behavior was awful. He kept harping on the "crazy" woman's behavior when she wouldn't do something he asked her to do and when he got frustrated at her lack of respect and went over and over what she did wrong, and yet he also kept making excuses for her behavior by claiming that she wasn't crazy and that she was trying to give him the perfect relationship. That's the textbook definition of crazy. But the author goes on about how this girl's behavior is perfectly normal and how he's not making a big deal out of it, just because the "crazies" are a bigger problem than he is. He then goes on a rant about how he is being abused and how his relationship is the worst thing that has ever happened to him, then he says, "I'm not the bad guy here." What kind of fucking world is this? I mean, that's like the exact mentality of the abusive man he is trying to be a part of. The only difference is that he claims that he doesn't feel like the abuser and he doesn the abuse, but I'm pretty sure he did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have spent many hours with this novel and can't stop thinking about how badly it's written.  The language and prose is simply so clumsy and out of place.  I'm also disappointed in the author's apparent lack of understanding of women's issues or the reality of women in war.  She uses words like "brutal" and "savage" in describing war crimes committed against civilians in war-torn countries, when they are simply offensive.  In another passage, she compares rape to a dog, an offensive and inappropriate comparison to make when it's used as a metaphor to describe sexual assault.  Her use of words like ugly and ugly is offensive to women in general and reinforces the perception that women are worthless and ugly.  Another point of offense is the author refers to a girl as a "cunt."  It's just a phrase thrown out for no reason at all and makes the book look even worse.  These are just some of the small things that make this book a bad one, but it really gets worse from there.  When I was looking for a book that would make me question my beliefs about religion, this is my least favorite. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While it has a lot to recommend it, it has very little to offer. In fact, it is almost impossible to get through it, with the story itself, and the supporting characters, and even the prose itself, all contributing in such a negative manner that the book is a disappointment in every way. The plot is very generic and has been done several times before, and there are too many characters, many of whom are completely unlikable and there is little or no development of any of them. For example, the protagonist, John, is a very dull, unfunny person. His only redeeming qualities are his love for his pet rabbit, and his passion for solving crimes (which he only does because he feels guilty about it). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is boring. It's a tedious rehash of the basic facts of economics with little variation.   A few of the references are more interesting than the book itself:  The basic supply and demand mechanics of the consumer and the business cycle   The economics of oil  The problem with Keynesian stimulus 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've given this book a negative rating on numerous occasions.  I hate how the author tries to use Christianity to justify the death penalty and how he attempts to make Christianity sound noble.  He quotes scripture in a way that is clearly meant to sound like the bible, but he tries to twist it and twist it, and I hate that.  The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it is about a man who used Christianity to do good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to buy this book.   It's about the rise of a religion based on the ideas of a guy named Joseph Smith, Jr.  It tells the story of how Smith, a poor farmer from Ohio, found people with the same religious beliefs and started his own church.  This was a good book, but I was put off by the whole thing after about the third chapter.  I knew that Smith was not the founder of the Mormon faith.  He just happened to be the first person to find people with those beliefs and start his own organization.  That's it.  And he died in 1844.  Still, this was enough for me to feel uneasy about his idea that people of other religions are "heathen" and "idolatrous."  I didn't have to buy it, but then again I might not have wanted to."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am now finished reading the book. The book was very well written, interesting and interesting. I have never met or read any of the authors, but the author did a good job with her own story. This is definitely a good read for the avid bibliophile. But as a reader with little to no interest in writing, it was just too bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the kind of book that I look forward to finishing on a rainy day.  I've enjoyed a lot of contemporary fiction, but not always at the same time.  This book is full of memorable characters, a good plot and a well-paced plot development.  The language and the plot are a bit of a stumbling block, but it's not as if the book is unreadable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book tells how the Nazis tried to make the Jews and the Communists (who had cooperated in the Holocaust) collaborate by creating an anti-Semitism that was based on the Jewish people's "evil, superstitious beliefs and their hatred of everything that isn't European." These beliefs include, but are not limited to, belief in a god of chaos who creates earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters, a god whose true nature is unknown and who rewards those who submit to his will. Hitler wanted to create a state where all Germans were "racially pure" and had to submit to racial laws that would put an end to "inferior races." It's a classic Hitlerism argument and the book is very biased towards it. The book never addresses the obvious differences in beliefs between the two groups, like the fact that they both believe in a supreme being and that their beliefs are not based on truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is one of the most boring I've ever read. I was actually rooting for the protagonists in the beginning, but this novel is just so contrived, so predictable, that I lost any interest. It makes me feel like I'm reading a children's story. It also seems like there's an alternate version of the same story that's supposed to be more interesting, but doesn't quite work the same.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It just does not work for me at all.   I really can't stand the fact that so many authors tell you that you have to be in love with the character or story for the book to work. I find it absurd and a betrayal of a great story.  And then there is this author saying that "love isn't just a feeling you get when you look at a gorgeous woman, or when you're at the altar, or with a long-term boyfriend"  Is that true? Does that mean that every relationship needs to be long-lasting and perfect, and every relationship requires you to love every person involved in it? I've had more than one long-running relationship that has been completely miserable and ended with us just barely talking about what we liked about each other before we gave in and ended things.  I'm not even sure I would call it love. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book really had a very bad ending. It wasn't very interesting or even remotely funny. There were so many things I wished the author would have shown us. The most obvious and relevant one was the fact that men are often attracted to other men. They may not want to sleep with a woman at the same time, but they do like men they know. In other words, when it comes to men and women, attraction isn't the same thing as desire. They can enjoy one another while not wanting to spend time with the other. I'm always a bit surprised by the number of female authors that have never really considered that. This is a real shame because I really want to learn more about female/male attraction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book from the start. I've always loved and appreciated books that delve into the lives of marginalized groups. And while I have enjoyed some of John Boyne's writing, I found this one to be a mess, from beginning to end.  While I did find some of the stories fascinating, I simply wasn't able to buy into Boyne the way I did in other books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can only describe this book as one long rant about how we have a terrible book industry and we need to get rid of it or something.  I've enjoyed a number of books by the author and while I appreciate her passion for the genre, I'm disappointed by her inability to put down the brush and paint any picture that isn't either black and white or just wrong.  Even worse, her own examples aren't any better (her take on a vampire tale is especially poor).  This is the second time I've purchased this book and my opinion of her writing has also waned as a result. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's really terrible   The author claims to be a "progressive" and a "liberal" in her writings, yet the only "liberalism" she promotes is that of the free market economy. She doesn't seem to mind all that much if the government is in charge. The market is evil? How about the "market economy" itself? She has no problem with a very repressive police state in Soviet Russia or a very oppressive church in the Middle Ages. In fact, she seems to be totally unaware of any actual government intervention on the market that she supports, so when a free market economic system is implemented in an undeveloped country in the 20th century, it can be quite a pain in the ass for the people who have to live under it. For example, in North Korea, the central bank issues a limited amount of currency and uses it to purchase an extensive range of goods and services (including food, medicine, etc.), but the supply of currency is extremely limited. In the midst of shortages of medicine and other necessities, a very large percentage of citizens are starving and dying from malnourishment, which results in massive malnutrition in the entire country. The government has actually encouraged these deaths by providing poor people with more and more food at an exorbitant price, in a desperate attempt to combat the growing number of malnurfed citizens. How can you call yourself a "libertarian" if you actually support an evil system like that? I also found that it was a bit odd how the author's father was a member of the Republican Party in the 60's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love all the books by Elizabeth Hand I've read, but this one by Mary Robinette Kowal is by far the worst.   It has so many obvious spelling and grammar errors that I felt like giving up on it when I finished it.  In addition, Kowale has a very weird way of presenting information.  For example, in this book she states that the Native Americans had only one kind of tooth.  When I told her this, she said, "No, the teeth are different colors.  These people didn't have white teeth, and you wouldn't have known that if you looked them up."  This is not something that can be easily verified.  She also refers to an alleged Native American hero who had three sons named Sam, Sam and Jack.  Kowali makes it seem that these were all three brothers.  This seems to be an example of her changing the name of the character over the years.  The name Sam Kowalski is also mentioned in this story and he is supposedly a well-known explorer who died in the New World, but I can find no information on this hero anywhere.  Even the name "Sam" was supposedly changed to "Shanks" and even this "Sam Kowasski" died in 1826.  I found that very strange as the story doesn't state that Sam's wife, who I assume would have been named Sue, died in childbirth.  Other odd things include the book claiming that the Cherokees once used gold to pay their debts.  To this day, I don't know where Kowaled's source for this claim came from.  At any rate, if you're going to make a mistake like this, you should at least tell the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I would enjoy this book. I did, but it was really so bad. It was so full of wrong information, so many things that were wrong, so much misinformation and wrong advice.   In a nutshell, this book said:  "It takes a lot of mental effort to do the right thing.  It takes a little extra effort to think about the wrong thing. "    Well, this is wrong for several reasons.  1. It's easy to just do what you want to do.  2. It takes an effort to stop what you're doing and think about what you should be doing.  3. If you try to do what everyone else is doing, you'll just be a follower.  4. If I try to think of the wrong way to do something, I'll just keep doing what everyone says I have to do   5. You shouldn't think of your own way.  If you don't know the answer to a question, you have to ask the question.  6. People who do what others say are lazy and selfish  7. If the answer is obvious, then people should stop doing what they're doing   8. You don't have to "think" about the question at all.  Just ask it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have just finished   and I think I'm going to give up after    It starts out very nice and engaging, but I found myself bored and irritated by it after about 20 pages.   Instead, I found it interesting and enjoyable for the first few pages, but then it becomes repetitive and repetitive.  It also seems like the author has a bias against "fantasy."   Even though I enjoyed the book a lot, I feel like the characters are all cardboard cutouts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm so tired of people quoting this book so much   There's a lot of "just-so" and it just doesn't make sense.  I understand the motivation, but 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book ever written. I was excited to read it because it is a retelling of the events that led to my first divorce (I believe that the book was written after her divorce, but I haven't read it in years). Unfortunately, it is full of factual errors, a complete lack of scholarship, and a complete refusal to provide any real explanation or justification for her divorce. The book makes no effort to answer the obvious question of why a "good" man, a religious man, would divorce a "bad" woman; why she would commit adultery and "throw herself in the arms of the devil." She explains that he is "a bad man, for the reason he is a good man." That's it. Nothing more. She never addresses any of her own reasons for the divorce or why she divorced him; what caused it, why he left, what her goals were, or what her motivations were. She even admits to not really having a good understanding of the issues involved in her divorce and says, "It was not a rational decision." She claims that she is not blaming herself and that the divorce was "the only sane thing for me to do at the time." Well, what were her goals? How did she feel about her former husband? How would she feel if she divorced someone else after a failed marriage? The book doesn't mention any of this or address the issues. There is just a lot of blame-shifting, a lot about the man not "being a good Christian," and a lot that seems to just be a rationalization of her actions. The reason she claims that the decision to divorce was the "only sane thing" is because she wanted to avoid a battle with the church. It doesn't say anything about the fact that she would probably have gotten much more favorable treatment if she had not had to go to church. The author says, "...she had a strong desire to get her divorce from him and avoid any further religious conflict with the Church..." What's wrong with getting your divorce from a bad man before having any more religious conflict?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, but found it so poorly written that I had to put it down in frustration. I have to give the author credit for being able to capture the beauty of poetry in prose, but in this case the prose became so cloying that I didn't like reading it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't bad in itself, but the title is misleading.  It's a collection of "experiences" written by four people: one who suffered from "a bad reaction to antidepressants," one who had "an incredibly bad reaction," one with "an unbelievably bad reaction" to an anti-psychotic drug, and one who experienced an "incredibly bad reaction."  They all described their reactions as being similar to reactions to an allergy, except for one person, who described the reaction as having "a very bad aftertaste."   I can't say I was all that bothered by these experiences.   But I wasn't totally surprised either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was a great read, but the part about children with cancer came off as a bit of a self-indulgent, narcissistic and selfish experience.   The whole thing seemed just a bit too happy for the kids, and they were too young to really feel that they were truly hurting or in danger from the disease.  I also found that the adults were quite unemotional, while the kids were very emotional and emotionaly emotional.  Overall, I thought the book was great! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea for the book is intriguing, and the writing is excellent.   However, the plot doesn't really come together as well as the beginning of the book suggests.  It starts off with some intriguing details about the history of a small town near Chicago that was founded by a French Huguenot priest in the 1600s.  Unfortunately, the narrator quickly goes off the rails and becomes quite insufferable about it.  Her snide remarks about the French Catholics and their lifestyle makes for quite the contrast with the small town character we were initially introduced to.  I was actually rooting for the poor, small town French Hugueinots to survive the persecution and finally come to the United States.  This is a disappointing start to the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book. I have had a good response to a book before by a friend but it is always on a personal level and doesn't really relate to the situation. I felt that this book was completely about the relationship of the female to the male. The male never expressed his feelings but always had some sort of excuse. It didn't feel authentic and felt like she was the only one who could understand him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did enjoy this book. It was interesting and not as preachy as some books I've read about this topic. But I still don't feel it was helpful to me in any way. This book was written in the 1970's and I have to admit that many of the things it mentions about the problems caused by homosexuality still resonate today. But the authors did a pretty poor job at explaining these issues to a modern audience, or, if you will, a modern Christian audience. It's a book written by someone who was in the 1980's and who is still reading "Bible studies" magazines and the like (a.k.a. what was popular in the 60's and 70's), so he can't be expected to understand what's happening today. He talks about things like gay marriages and the "homosexual problem" without really explaining why it was or isn't a problem. He also talks about the "gay problem" in a way that implies that it's a "moral" problem, which is a very recent idea. While some people claim that homosexuality is an illness, it is not a "bad" illness. It is simply a sexual orientation. He mentions the "biblical view" of homosexuality but again he doesn't provide any evidence that the Bible teaches anything about it, or that the only reason people have this view is because of "homophobia" and the need for "conversion". He mentions homosexuality as a problem for children in order to suggest that if you have a child who is gay or lesbian you can simply tell them "Don't be gay!". But he seems to miss the fact that this is a choice for the child. He makes it sound like this is an innate part of the child's sexuality, and that if parents don't accept this part of their child's sexual orientation, then the child may not grow up to be gay or homosexual. That's not exactly how it works. Some people are born with a sexual preference for the same sex, but they don't grow up wanting to be that way. Sometimes people don't want to be either gay or straight. They just are. I find it odd that the authors chose to use the words "born that way" instead of "born homosexual" to describe this. That seems to imply that it was something the child wanted to be, and the parents couldn't change their minds about it. He even says that if a child grows up to not want to have a sexual attraction to
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the author's style to be unnecessarily verbose and repetitive. It would have been better for her to include notes that could easily be copied and pasted into a journal.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best part of the book is the end, where a young girl who suffers from anxiety is able to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. I really enjoyed the mental health stories in the book and the way that Dr. Schwartz explains them.   But at the end of the day, the book doesn't actually help with any of the symptoms mentioned. The first part of it, the part that discusses the mental disorders, isn't bad, but the third and last part of that section is.  The book talks about how these disorders are "self-limiting"   and how they "cannot be cured by the treatment methods used by psychiatrists."  The implication is that if only people could be cured of the disorders themselves, we wouldn't have to pay psychiatrists to do it.  That's a really bad argument,  because there's no reason a psychiatrist could not treat patients with the same methods.  So in other words, if your symptoms are really really bad, there's probably something wrong with your body 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main characters were so annoying and unlikable.  A total non-entity that needed to be written off with the usual "he'll get over it" lines, and then another character comes along and starts acting like a total jerk.  The two characters were such a big part of this book's success that I was shocked when it went from being a good read to an abysmal failure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have given this book five stars.  Unfortunately, the author tries to make everything about the "real" life of the late great poet John Cage "great", even if he was a bit of a jerk.  The book makes no mention of the fact that Cage was a deeply troubled man and a serial drug user who constantly lied about his age.  In fact, Cage was such a prick that his first attempt at writing a musical had him attempting to convince his wife and manager to let him put the music on the radio while she was in the shower because "it wouldn't bother him so much if he could pretend it was his wife singing".  The whole book makes Cage out to be the kind of guy who has the most interesting life but is actually pretty boring.  At least Cage was pretty funny.  Maybe it's the fact this is from the man who wrote "It's Only Love" that really makes this bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is an appalling piece of trash.  The book is a poorly written collection of pseudoscience, with an abysmal lack of scientific accuracy or depth of knowledge.  It makes claims of medical benefit that are not supported by any science, and it contains many egregious falsehoods.  Some of the pseudoscientific claims are:  * "When the brain is damaged by brain trauma, there are three main pathways of communication between the brain and the body. These three pathways are known as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the cerebrum (or brain).  The CSF is the fluid that contains the brain's cells and contains everything from chemicals that aid in cell growth to substances that protect neurons and help prevent cell death.  CSF helps transmit chemical messages, which then activate the body's own cells, triggering a biochemical reaction in the body to heal the damaged tissue."    False!  The brain is made up of hundreds of specialized cells, and the CSF, by definition, does not contain cells.   CSFs contain the cells that are damaged, but only after a very long time.  In the context of the book, the CSFs are only relevant for the period in which the damaged cells are being repaired.  As for "chemical messages," the chemicals that the brain uses to communicate are not stored in the CSFS, as the authors claim.  Instead, the chemicals communicate by releasing and reacting with molecules, which is a much simpler process than "talking" via chemicals.  These chemicals are known to trigger harmful reactions when they enter the brain.  Additionally, a variety of chemicals are released and react to different types of cells, just like a normal cellular communication system.  Lastly, the claims about the CSFTU being the brain cell's "natural repair system" are ludicrous.  This book should be regarded as a waste of money, as it is nothing but pseudoscienc 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book. The concept of a time machine is interesting, but I was really disappointed by the lack of actual time travel. It's like the author wanted to write a book about time travel because he knows that most people just give up after reading about it (and he was an avid time traveler, so I think he knows how ridiculous his ideas are). The time travelers that he describes have all the advantages of being alive: they have knowledge of the future, they know how to solve problems, etc., but they never seem to have a chance to put their skills to use. Maybe the book's premise could have been better had the time travel been real time travel, or time travel like the Time Machine from Back to the Future. The problem was that the book never really dealt with time travel and only had a few chapters about the characters' lives as time travelers. In addition, the book was full of errors: I was confused when the author referred to the 1960s as the "golden age of American science fiction." Also, the author never showed how the time traveler time-traveled to the past, and didn't even have a detailed explanation for how this was possible (though he claimed the concept was demonstrated in The Day the Earth Stood Still ). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poorly written novel full of plot holes, a poorly written, non-existent plot, and a terribly executed narrative.  This book was a complete bore to read.  The protagonist has an insatiable appetite for violence and sexual sadism, a tendency to act on those urges in bizarre and disturbing ways. This is often the case with the author's works in general.  Although the author is a trained criminal defense attorney, he has managed to convince himself and others that these impulses are merely "disorders" rather than the result of an unhealthy lifestyle and a deep-seated moral void.  Unfortunately, the author cannot understand that people can have different mental problems and that many are simply not "normal."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did NOT find this book to be a bad read. However, it does not really have much to say. It's a typical work on the Jewish Diaspora and is not even particularly interesting. If I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have loved it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand why this book is so bad. It begins by describing an unfortunate family vacation that is interrupted by a car accident that kills the mother, father, and two young children. The author claims that it's no big deal, because the car accident wasn't a big deal when the crash happened. It's true that the accident didn't seem that bad when it happened, but the family was in terrible shape. They were poor, and the accident changed their life forever. They lost a family member, and they had to start over. It seems clear that the author doesn't have the slightest clue how to make a story interesting or entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a reader of this book, I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it did not live up to those expectations. The characters are interesting, and they do some interesting things, but the plot is so cliched and predictable that I had to put the book down. There's also some sex in this book that I just didn't find very sexy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My review is so short and generic:  I didn't like it at all.  It was repetitive, boring, and poorly written.  I'm glad I didn´t buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been waiting for this book for months. It sounds great and it's based on one of the most famous and popular works of literature of the 20th century. But alas.  I'm just not a fan of reading history books written by white people who have a problem with their white privilege.  The book is interesting but I was disappointed to see that it was largely based on white people talking about white people.  It's a shame that this is how most non-white people experience 20th and 21st century America. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I wanted to make sure I didn't make the same mistakes as the book's author, who is quite good.  I didn.  As I went through the first two chapters, I kept wondering what my problem was.  There are a lot of "rules" and "do's" that she puts out that I've seen over and over again in the worst cases that the books she writes about have in common.  First, she says we should keep our bodies warm in the winter, even when we know the air is fine.  Second, she recommends we stay in the bedroom even when the air in the house is perfect.  Third, she tells us to keep our nails short and not to have long nails.  She tells us that we should brush our teeth as well, but that the toothpaste she uses contains sugar.  What's with these rules?  This book sounds like a set of rules I'd like to break.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. As a fan of "Hogfather" I was interested in reading it and I can say that it is a great read for fans of the books but also for readers of "Downton Abbey". It is fast paced and enjoyable but a bit heavy on the character development and dialogue.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was awful, and I can only imagine how many people are going to lose their sanity because of this. If I could give this a 0 or 1 star rating, I would. The writing is terrible. Every sentence is a problem, it's poorly formatted, and you can tell the author is just copying from a book and not being very original. The story is also terrible, since the characters don't learn anything new, the plot is predictable, and there are so many plot holes that it would be a crime to write them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is so bad and poorly written that I can't put it down. This book is a mix between A Clockwork Orange and an old book by James Frey called The Grapes of Wrath. The book itself is written in first person by an alcoholic who is a high school senior (actually he is a junior, and was never high in school) and tries to find his place in life. He meets a girl and she becomes pregnant and tries her best to get him to go to college, but he refuses. He also meets other high school seniors who think he is not only not doing what he needs to do, but that he's living in the past. I had read many books written by high school students but this one by someone whose life is in the present is the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character is boring, a middle-aged woman who is obsessed with things like "history", "the way the world was" and "history". She's always talking about history (and she's in love with it) and then when she gets caught in one of the "accidents" (in which it's clear she didn't even try to avoid them) she seems so surprised about it that she gets even more embarrassed and she's always caught in similar ones. The only good thing that comes out of this book is that her daughter seems to think she's a "real" historian. It's a waste of time that she's reading about it so much. The rest of the book is a mess, full of pointless explanations for things, so much for the "history" that she was trying to give. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to read this book. I have wanted to read about the Holocaust for some time. I also wanted to know what would happen if someone was successful in escaping from the death camps.  The end of the book did not disappoint. The author talks about the people he knows that survived. They were all successful because they had a plan and stayed alive. The problem is, it is very hard to stay alive when you are in a death camp.  I don't know how it is possible to live through all of those conditions, but I am so glad that they were successful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading this book thinking that it would be some kind of literary take on the history of the British Army.  But the author's style is so stiff and dry that it turns out to be a farce.  At one point, for example, she describes the English resistance to Hitler:  "The war was fought over a single man: the English Resistance."   She then goes on to describe a group of Englishmen in Italy who have been captured and executed, their bodies placed in the street.  The authors of this book claim that this is evidence that the British people at that time wanted nothing to do with their Nazi occupiers.  I find it extremely unlikely that the English would have wanted to be involved in an atrocity against their own countrymen.  It is true that Hitler did recruit many people from the British Isles, but it was mainly because he wanted the manpower for his Waffen SS. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't want to sound too negative here, but    there are just too many errors to be counted here   It's just too bad that the author decided to put this book together as part of her writing seminar at a community college instead of using it as a reference work. She could have used it for the classes instead, but I just can't recommend this book for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very bad. The plot and the writing are poorly developed, the characters are badly written, and the language is poorly written.  The only positive aspect of this book is the title: 'The War of the Words'.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot of this book is not the best.  It's not the worst either.  There is something charming about the idea that people are so caught up in what they see that they do nothing about it.  But, that's where the good parts stop.  As the main character, we're all thinking about how much we would have to change if we could just make things right.  You want a great romance, but the whole thing comes across as cheesy and forced.  The bad part?  It ends so quickly and doesn't make any impact. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to my 5 year old son and to me, this is a great book. It gives a really good insight about how to parent when your child is not as mentally mature as you. I can tell that the author spent a lot of time with his son and learned from him. However, I don't feel he really learned anything. I feel the author's main purpose here was to promote the book and make a quick buck off a good idea. I felt he was just there to tell us what we didn't want to hear and then use the information to make money off of.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book after hearing about a wonderful "children's book" based on the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling that uses words from the books to teach children important life lessons. Unfortunately, this book did not teach me any lessons. The book is very poorly written. It is full of spelling errors and poor spelling practice. For example, "The cat had just got out of the bag" is "The bag had just gotten out of" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, as written, is a great read. Unfortunately, as soon as I started reading it, I began to realize that the author's view of the world is not a shared view that many others share. The world is too complicated. Too many forces are in conflict. Too much is happening, both good and bad, on so many levels. In the end, it's just hard to see what all the fuss is about. The author's views of the state of the American world are too narrow to be helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought and read the first three books in the Little, Big series of YA fantasy series.  I was looking forward to reading them all and getting to the good part, but I was let down.    It started off okay, with strong female protagonists.  But after the first two books, the male characters, as far as I could tell, became more and more interchangeable.  There were even times when they were simply one-dimensional characters, but they were the only ones that would be around in the long run.  And then, there were the bad parts.  The first book, which I just finished, features a terrible main character who dies.  It's a very uninspired way to start, and it seems like the author has no idea what to do with him.  He's so dull that I felt like I was reading a bad novel, not a great YA series. I was also disappointed that the series does not progress in the same way as the other books in this series.    It took me seven books to get from book one to book seven, which means I spent way too long getting from one good book to the next.  Hopefully, next time, the author will give the main character a chance to shine, instead of putting him in a situation where he dies.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the book. It was interesting, and the quotes were all from very interesting people. However, after reading the book I didn't really feel the need to read more. It just didn't give me anything I wanted. I'm not saying that there aren't things worth reading (although they may not come to me). What I am saying is that I read this book and I wasn't interested, but it seemed to be something I would have to read. Now I have to pay for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started reading this book expecting it to be a classic and ended up just being a tedious, boring read. I had high hopes for this book, but it wasn't anything special. I'm not even sure what I thought I was getting with this book. The writing style is very "self-conscious", which I love, but I find it very tiresome at times. The way the author is presenting his/her own thoughts is especially annoying. The fact that the author seems to always feel the need to compare himself/herself to others is also tiresome.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been an avid reader of urban fantasy since I first discovered The Chronicles of Amber.  The first five books in the series are among my top ten all time favorites.  However, I found the sixth book, The Eye of the World, unsatisfying.  I did not feel like I'd been let in on the secret of the Horned King and his followers.  There were no new characters introduced, no new ideas, and no interesting plot developments.  In short, the book felt like another copy of a series I already knew and liked.  This time, however, it didn't feel so bad since I'd already read the prior books in my own order.  And while the characters were bland and uninteresting, the story was engaging and original.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A novel that claims to be about the Civil War, but really is more about the American War Against American Slavery. I'm not sure that's a good thing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written for a very small audience. This is clearly a book intended for young children, which may have been part of the inspiration for the author's choice of a title. There is a lot of spelling and grammatical errors that are hard to miss, but I can't say I feel the same way about the book itself, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to read this book when it came out, but I didn't realize it was so horrible until I was almost through. While the main characters are interesting, the main plot is a mess. The characters are not interesting at all.  The main character (a doctor who worked in the medical field) is a sociopath. He is the most evil person in the book, and has no respect for anyone who is not him.  He is willing to kill everyone who has a problem with him. If he doesn't get his way, he has no qualms about killing. He has no remorse for his actions. He goes after a patient even though he knows he will only have to kill her once. He treats the people around him like animals who are only there for his convenience. He shows no respect to the family members of his victims and he can't even remember the last time he saw his mother.  I found myself wishing that the main character had been eliminated before the book ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book is the worst thing I've ever bought.    The author tells us she is a former medical professional who has decided to focus on healing, but fails spectacularly in every chapter.  There is nothing about healing that is anything but self-serving.  While there is some good information, the author is way over her head with her pseudoscience and other nonsense.  I can't believe she is trying to sell her "findings" to the public in this book.  The writing is awful.  It is so bad that I'm afraid the book is going to kill me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The fact that the author believes that her subject is a fraud is enough to disqualify the book from being a serious work.  A more credible book would be The Great Con Artist: My Life on the Edge.  She makes it sound as if he's always been lying about his financial records, his past relationships, and his real career.  He claims to have "made" $400 million for a bank, and that he was born in Africa and came to America.  She tells us that he has a "real" passport, and a "proper" Social Security number.  His real address is listed as "Cape May, NJ" and is actually a hotel in Florida.  And he has "real jobs" as a motivational speaker, a real estate developer, and an "entertainer" -- none of which he's ever claimed to do.  The author seems to think that the only reason this guy has been able to make a living for the past 20 years is because people have taken his money for a fad and have given him credit for his accomplishments.  I could go on and on about the problems in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't bad, just poorly written. This book is about an organization that attempts to bring together various aspects of life (relationships, interests, hobbies, hobbies) into one organization. It does this by creating a very organized and standardized way of doing things (i.e. a "process"). The organization of the processes, however, can be a little over the top in its execution. For example, one process that would be used to organize relationships would be to create an "adoptive" parent relationship. The parent in this instance is considered the "official" parent and the child the "adopted" child. In this manner, a person with little to no connection to his/her biological parent can be adopted as the child of the "parent" he/she doesn't know. It would be considered a wonderful and loving parent. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case. The adoption process can be incredibly isolating. In fact, one of the reasons that adoption is so expensive is because many people with no connection are willing to pay for the right to adopt someone whom they do not have a relationship with. It's not always for the best, but this is definitely not a case of "love at first sight" (as many people claim).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be lacking in both substance and insight. It is a superficial look at the relationship between Buddhism and modernity that fails to adequately understand Buddhism's most important and effective means of maintaining harmony: silence. The author, a Buddhist scholar who writes on the relationship of philosophy and religion, attempts to show how Buddhism can be used by modern Western society. I found his argument lacking. The chapter on silence is a poor attempt at showing how Buddhism works within our modern world. We are in a time when the idea of a transcendental state of silence is beginning to enter the popular consciousness. It seems to have gained currency in the last decade. But when it comes to applying Buddhism to this modern world, the author fails miserably. Buddhism is not an easy religion to follow. It has rules that cannot be broken, yet it still demands our devotion and time. The Buddha was famous for being quiet and for being very quiet. It's important to note that he was one of the first Buddhist teachers to adopt a modern form of speech in which he was always teaching the dharma to people in a low, loud, and noisy environment. I'm not sure what the author thought this translated to, but the dharmic benefits of silence seem to have been lost on him. The whole concept of silence in Buddhism is about maintaining peace within our mind and in our relationships with others. To practice silence does not mean being a robot or a monk or avoiding any noise. It means maintaining peace in our minds and in ourselves through practice of mindfulness and meditation. The first rule of Buddhism, sutras, teaches us that there are no sounds that we are able to ignore. We can only remain silent when there are sounds. This is very important in the study of Buddhism. The second rule of silence: keep silence as the only sound that you hear. This means that whenever you think of anything you must say nothing at all. It sounds like a very difficult task, but it really isn't. It requires effort and concentration. The book is very short, but there is a lot of unnecessary information. There are many references to other people's books and websites, which can be very useful, but I would have preferred that they had referred to my own research. I would not have read this book had it been a one-on-one conversation with a knowledgeable, well-spoken and very interesting scholar. I will not be recommending this book as a reference, but more of a summary.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved reading this book, but I couldn't take my eyes off of the fact that all the authors are white men.   The story is told from the point of view of a white female character, and the majority of the book is a description of her love life.  I know that there are women out there who are not interested in men as much as white men, and these women are the most likely to be portrayed as "crazy."  These women are also less likely to have "crazy" tendencies, so why don't we ever see any of them in the media?

Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was so much going on in this book, from the main character's upbringing to her search for her missing sister, that one can easily lose track of the main plot.  For me, the book was more interesting than the characters, and I was more interested in finding out what happened to her sister.  I'd say that there is enough information in this to keep the reader interested for a bit, but at the same time, this book is rather slow-moving. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a total disappointment. I wanted to like it, but as usual, I didn't.   The characters are completely unlikeable; they're shallow and not well-rounded; and they're so utterly oblivious to and unaware of the consequences of their actions that their stupidity is laughably hilarious.  The plot is laughable; the characters are poorly-developed, and the plot is poorly-explained in a way that makes the characters come across as clueless.  I'm sorry that the author did his homework on the subject of Islam and the Middle East, but the author's ignorance of Islam is more depressing than the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a book that would give me the answers to my questions, so that I could stop worrying about life and focus on my studies.   Instead, I got a confusing book full of the same problems  I see with the modern day    that are   inherent in the   culture   of science:    The problem isn't that people can't think.  It's that their thought processes aren't organized.  The problem is that they have such a wide range of options available to them that they don't know which option is the best.  They just don't bother with it.  If you can't figure out which one is the right one, you don't think enough.  That's the main problem with modern science:   People think  because they can.  People with different mindsets are allowed to think different things.  People who don't have different minds,  don't even try to think about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title is just terrible, as is the book itself.  The book is supposed to be about a black man named Michael Jackson, but it's actually about two white men who became friends with Michael. The book basically shows that the two white guys were responsible for Michael's drug and alcohol problems. This is interesting to read, but the problem with the book is that there's no real substance to the claim.  Even if the claims are true, they are presented in a way that makes them seem more important and dramatic than they really are.  It's more interesting for Michael to be in a bad relationship with the white men and then discover that he's in love with the black woman, even though it doesn't fit with the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book a couple years ago, and it was awful.  It was written by a woman who thinks all males are pedophiles.  She writes things like "A man who likes to watch young girls get molested is no different from a man who sexually abuses a baby in its crib." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have purchased and read a great number of children's books about dinosaurs, and this one isn't one of them.  The dinosaurs are all so stupid and not very believable, and their adventures and relationships are flat and boring.  If you're buying this book to keep for a rainy day, I hope you're getting something a bit more fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a good book.  There is almost nothing that will help students prepare for the GRE.  I have taken many classes on the topic but never been taught how to read a GRE exam question.  It is just pure guess work.  This book has nothing useful to offer.   The author is great at writing about people she does not like, but this time she is at it again by writing about a good person and how she is not like that.  Even though the book is not very good, the author's personality makes it more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written by a woman who has been around the block. She has read and/or heard all the critiques of women's history in popular culture. The result is a book that is so biased against women's role in history that it reads more like a personal attack. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are several chapters that I skimmed because I thought the point of the book was just to attack people who are religious, or believe in a deity.  I didn't find those chapters very interesting.  There's a lot of talk about the evils of alcohol (I have been there and I found it very damaging) and a lot about how some religious leaders are just wrong about a lot, but I couldn't really connect with that because of my own personal journey with alcohol abuse and alcoholism.  The book has a lot to say about what it means to be an atheist, but doesn't really address it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with so many mistakes that one has to wonder if it was written by a teenager.  The main character, John, who is from a religious family, is repeatedly encouraged to read the Bible, but he does not.  Then, he is told by his father to read a book he borrowed from a friend, but John refuses.  He gets annoyed and tells his father that it is his Bible, and his Bible alone.  But his father doesn't listen and takes John to church, where he is asked to read from his Bible as if he were a pastor.  Now that's funny, because John is actually supposed to be an ordained minister.  It seems that the author got confused about the difference between a "bishop" and a "priest."  John is told that his religious upbringing is irrelevant to his religious life, but then his father is seen in a new light when he has to explain why he hasn't read the Scriptures at all.  In another scene, his father has a conversation with his young son and explains that if he does well in school, he will go to a good college and be able to "take care of his family."  The author seems to think that if John wants to make a family, he should have no choice but to go to church.  I mean, if he can make a better life for himself by doing his religious duty, why can't he use that same "freedom" to have a family of his own?  I know that the book was intended for teenagers, but it would have been more interesting to have some grown-up perspective.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is just so wrong about history that it's really disappointing.  It makes a point that the "golden age" of America was dominated by small scale, personal, and community agriculture, but this just isn't true.  The US is not the land of small farms or community-based economies.  In fact, the US government actively encourages and subsidizes big farms and agribusiness.  Small farms are just as productive as big farms, but the government takes a huge chunk of their income.  Even the small farms that aren't subsidized are often less efficient and profit less than big agribuests.  While the small farmers in the book don't do well (I've done well in small farms), most small farms are a huge hassle to run and don't produce a lot of money.  Furthermore, large agribuses don't really give back to the community, and so the community often doesn't benefit from them.  There is so much wrong in the piece that I am not sure what to think about it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was interested in reading this book, but sadly found that it was full of "how to" rather than "why." The book is full of advice and the author makes a lot of good points, but they do not get discussed or answered. Instead, the book is a series of "How I did it" stories.  There were a couple of "hacks" that I found interesting, and it might have been helpful to read another book that discusses these methods. However, as a rule, "How to" books tend to be much more interesting than "Why" books.  I would not give this book a negative rating, but I would recommend that readers who want to learn more about how to improve their English (which is the main goal of the book) do not bother with this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started the book by recommending it to my husband as an interesting look at the problems of society in the twenty first century.  I was disappointed as he hated the book and could not put it down once he started.  He was so irritated that he could not even get through half the book.  Not worth the trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading  The Great Gatsby. I was so disappointed.   The novel was really not worth the $20 I paid for it.  The story is so lame.  All the characters are boring, and the author tries to make everything interesting by using the phrase "The Great G.A.S.T." I didn't think it was funny, but that's because I wasn't really watching the movie.  My problem is that all of the movie references were in bad jokes and the novel just got boring fast.  I'll have to keep my eyes out for a real Gats by Gore Vidal or William Faulkner. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many things that could have been done differently. One thing I wish was done more often:  The characters' names (Sophie, Emma, and Helen) don't really come to us until the final third of the book, which I think would have given us a more rounded view of them. It makes a lot of sense when they do show up, but it would have made for more interesting dialogue, which is always a plus. I also wished that Sophie was less defensive about her feelings for her sister. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love  The Hunger Games but this book is terrible.  The characters are unlikable and it's so bad they are laughable.   This is a story about three girls who are all competing in a Hunger Games.  In one of the sections the girls are competing with one another to see who can eat the most food.  One of the competitors is Katniss from the movies.  It's really no different than being in a race but the only difference is that the goal is to eat the food rather than to win the race.  This book has a bad habit of making the women seem like dumb, hungry little kids who can't control themselves, so it's even worse than usual. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am going to get the "good" books that have been written about him now. They are a better read than the bad ones. So sad to see the time we wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book. I'd loved the books of her other books, and I wanted to enjoy them as well, but the writing just doesn't come together very well for me. She writes a few short stories in each book, and those stories have a lot of potential, but they seem to be thrown together too hastily. She also has a very long paragraph about a woman in the 16th century who died because she couldn't afford to feed her baby after giving birth, so we learn that women in that time had to stay in the home to feed their families. That seems like a horrible situation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really loved this book, but it is so long (about 700 pages, including index) that I found it very difficult to get through it. There are so many pages of repetition that I couldn't keep up. For example, there's a chapter about how the ancient Babylonians used the moon to predict eclipses. However, there is never any discussion of whether this was really a useful technology or whether the Babylonians actually had any special insight into the timing of eclipses (or even whether they were right in the first place). Instead, the chapter is mostly an extended discussion of astrology. Then, there are chapters about what the Babylonian astronomical predictions really meant--what the ancient Greeks thought they meant--then chapters about the supposed similarities between astrology and meteorology (with the ancient Greek idea of the influence of the moon on weather being used as an example) and then another chapter about the "true science" of astrological forecasting, then another one about how astrology is actually an ancient form of idolatry and the whole chapter is filled with a long series of explanations as to how astrologie was really an invention of the ancient Israelites. Then there's the chapter on astrology in China, where the chapter starts with an interesting discussion of the relationship between the Chinese and the sun. However it then moves on to explain how the Chinese thought the sun came from the moon and the moon was the sun, but then a bit further on it moves on (without explaining what it meant to "understand") to astrology, and it explains the relationship of the two again but this time talks about how both the sun and the lunar cycle influence the weather in different ways--again without ever explaining anything about the actual relationship between either phenomenon and weather. That's really just a bad list all in all. I think the author did a good job of explaining the basic principles, but he really needs to get to the bottom of the "what does it all mean" question.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of the claims made in this book are not supported by the evidence. For example, one of the authors cites studies on the relative effects of different cognitive styles in a way that assumes that people will pick the right style for each task they encounter. If the author had just read those studies, he or she could have found the studies to be problematic. Instead the author cites the wrong studies, and then dismisses all of them as invalid on the grounds that the methods used were invalid. The problem is that people tend to pick the method that seems most logical to them, regardless of the validity of the method. That's not to say that people should ignore studies that disagree with their preferences, but they should be aware of the limitations of those studies. Also, one reason that some cognitive styles are easier to use in school is that teachers like having some way of checking up on the students to make sure they're doing well in the lessons. As long as the students are doing well, teachers don't need to take any special measures to monitor them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a pretty good book if you have read the first two.  The book starts with the great "The End of Faith", which presents an intelligent critique of religion and of religion-as-science.  Unfortunately, this critique is not extended to the subject of the third volume, "The Scientific Consensus".  The third volume of "The New Atheist" is all about atheism and science, and it is a disappointment.   The only interesting aspect of the book is the description of the "Dawkins' model" of the mind, which explains how evolution and cognitive science can be used to explain how the mind works.  I found this fascinating and interesting, but not as good as the book by Dawkins. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poorly written, poorly researched book that gives a totally one dimensional view of a controversial subject. The author does not understand the difference between a historical narrative, historical fact and what the author wants to create. The historical facts are often ignored or changed to the point that the author can then claim the book is accurate and unbiased. At times the author is too hasty in asserting the facts and does not wait for the facts to be confirmed by other historical sources. Some of the author's arguments are so extreme that it borders on libel and should have been considered at the time of its creation. The history is also so far removed from the current state of the nation that it becomes difficult to believe many of the things written. A historical account of a topic that is completely out of date may seem to be relevant but when there are so many historical sources supporting the story, it becomes doubtful whether the author was truly inspired by the events of history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've just finished a paperback copy of "The New Abolitionists: A Century of Radical Thought." While there are parts of this book that have a good message and a good set of authors, the whole is a mess. The central theme is an attempt to resurrect the idea of abolition as a movement for social change. It's a good idea, although not one that I'm really interested in. I am instead more interested in the politics of abolitionist thinking. However, the "new abolitionists" have a lot of problems that are not well-explained in the book.   While the discussion is very important, I just don't understand how anyone can possibly read this book and conclude that abolition as an idea is still very important. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my opinion, this book is about as good as it gets for the genre. The concept itself is interesting, and the author has done a great job of tying together many strands of fiction into one book.  I was also impressed by the fact that the author had some real, legitimate research behind his material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disappointment.  It is very basic, uninteresting, and devoid of interesting ideas. The author spends an entire chapter describing a game called "Tetris". Tetris has been around since the 1950s and has been the most played puzzle game ever. Tetris is fun, but it is just another game. The game itself is not interesting.  Tetris was created by a Japanese company called Taito.  Taito is famous for making arcade games like Donkey Kong and Galaga. Taito has never had a hit video game. I remember seeing the "Galaga" arcade game in a movie theater once.  To add insult to injury, Tetris, while not a great game by any means, was far superior to Galaga in every way. In Galaga, you could see the other player moving his ships around. In Tetris the objects are always the same so you never see any other ships move.  The author never explains what happened to Taito after the game was invented. It seems Taito just sat on the game and ignored it.  After Tetris went out of style and Taito's name was forgotten, other companies began copying the game.  That is why, in a way, Tetrises is a big disappointment. The only interesting game Taito made is the sequel to Tetris called Super Tetris.  I know that was the same title but that was never made by Taito so I was not going to pay any attention to the name.  In spite of this one big disappointment, Tetrosees is still a good, informative book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read several of the "Best of X" series, but this one is the worst.   It has a weak plot, no suspense, bad language, and just awful characters.  It's also filled with spelling and grammatical errors.  I don't even have a favorite, just a favorite book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is awful - the book is more of an essay, and the first part of the essay is extremely poor.   There are two or three pages where she tries to make the argument for why there are some important moral differences between Christianity and Islam (not really convincing, since there are quite a few examples that show Christian teachings to be consistent with Islamic teachings), but they just go nowhere.  The whole "Islamic law allows for beheadings and other harsh punishments" argument is basically an excuse to show how wrong Christianity is.  This book is the exact reason I stopped reading religious books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of my time and money.  The author makes claims about a "real" alien encounter that are simply not true, which leads to some truly amusing misunderstandings on the part of the reader.  One of the examples of this is the assertion that the alien "grows on the skin" of a man:  This is the one alien technique that was never explained.  I guess this is what the "hippies" had in mind, although no one ever said "grow on the back of a bald man."  One story of a "man-made" creature in California that supposedly "spits" when its "fear of humans" is at its worst was a complete and utter fabrication, too.  It's just a big green blob.  Other alien concepts are equally spurious.  A creature called the "Harmonizer," for example, is described as "a creature that sits between Earth and other planets" that is "very friendly" and "very powerful."   No such creature is known to exist.   The claim that the "UFO" known as Roswell is an "alien spacecraft" that crashed on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., is even more absurd.  Roswell was an Air Force "reconnaissance" satellite launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.   No extraterrestrial bodies were ever found at the crash site.   All of this would be less of a problem if the author had kept in mind the standard format of his books and just used a more "professional" cover than the one that appears above.  Still, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who cares about the truth of such claims.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was extremely disappointed in this book.   The plot is so bad that the characters seem to exist only to provide plot material.  The book is about the author's parents passing away in the same year and she is left alone to look after her younger sister (who is schizophrenic).  Her sister becomes so desperate for help that she starts asking a variety of people for help.  She even has a "psychiatrist" (who seems to be making a fortune off of psychiatric patients) try and help her.  Then the author gets bored with the character and stops writing.  There are a couple of nice character moments (the older sister and her father) but nothing really develops.  I found myself wishing the book had ended after the older sister died, as I did not feel any further interest in her character.  It also really bothered me that I was left hanging for so long after the last character died, with the author constantly asking me for my opinion.  If the author wanted me to continue reading, she needed to have some kind of closure (other than the fact that I had no interest in the characters anymore) and had to be realistic about what would happen next.  Sadly, this did not happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story line was really interesting. But the ending, with the woman dying and then turning into the ghost of a girl is really stupid. I mean, if you look at what the ghost is supposed to be like (a girl with a heart defect), the woman would still be alive, even though her heart would be gone. So how could her heart be gone and yet still be living? The best way to describe it is if a guy turns into a frog after being caught by his girlfriend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of books by people who have no sense of humor. But this one was a joke from the very first page. Every joke seems like an effort to make a good impression on the reviewer and he tries to make me laugh but never comes close. I tried to read it because my friend gave it a good review, but I just couldn't get into it. It's really unfortunate that the author decided to put so much effort into his imitation of a comedian. It seems like the author would have gotten a better response if he actually wrote the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of Peter V. Brett's books (I have been for years). But I was very disappointed in this one. It wasn't that it was bad. Rather, it was that there were so many aspects of the plot that were simply irrelevant or outright impossible to accomplish in the novel's present time and space (which, to be fair, was a huge stretch). If I had spent a single extra hour reading it I probably would have come away thinking it was a brilliant sci-fi novel. But as it is, I'm going to go with the negative reviews on Goodreads:  It's like the worst of Star Wars or Harry Potter, except the characters don't get any of the cool gadgets. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My expectations were high from the outset of this book: a highly technical and erudite survey of the problems in computer science. I was disappointed to find the material disappointing.  The first chapter is a good introduction to computer science, but after that it becomes just another attempt to explain things in a technical way that is difficult to follow, and perhaps unintelligible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not finished a good book in years:  I found it so disappointing that I felt cheated when I finished the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I would be blown away by this one.  It seemed so impressive.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  I've been meaning to read this book for years, but was always put off by its poor grammar and poor writing.  Fortunately, it's finally been written down in its entirety, and I'm very glad I finally had the courage to give it a try.  The most disappointing part was the poor ending.  We never learn anything about the parents, and we have no idea why the kids were so obsessed with the doll.  In addition, there's also no explanation of why the parents would sell the doll if it was such a terrible investment.  Also, there is no explanation why the kid would have such a crush on the doll for the first time in her life.  Overall, I found this book disappointing, especially considering the amazing cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a big fan of the original series I was very excited to read this book. As it turned out, I really didn't enjoy it as much as I was looking forward to.   The story about the boy's quest to become a hero is interesting but the actual story line is a mess.  They go out and rescue a bunch of people from a fire, then try to convince someone to let them stay, but they end up running around trying to help people find their missing things.  This happens every other page.  Then they go to a house to look for something else, and we learn that the house is abandoned.  Finally, they try to save a little boy from drowning and end up accidentally killing him.  I don't know about anyone else, but I found this very hard to stomach.  It's as if someone pulled a tired old plot from the Twilight Zone and recycled it for the teen market.  As I said, this is the best book from the series, and I can't recommend this one enough, but this one wasn't my cup of tea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first chapter is very badly written and is almost laughable. It's a bit like an English teacher trying to teach children how to speak English. I was laughing out loud.    Even though the first few pages of the book are really good, after a few more pages, the story becomes repetitive and the characters are flat. It is very hard to relate to them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm glad I waited to buy this book until my shelf had plenty of books by women. I'm a female and had wanted to read this book since its publication, and I've been waiting for the paperback to go on sale. Unfortunately, I was so excited by the announcement that I bought a copy right before I was due to travel overseas.  There's nothing that I liked about the book other than the ending and the cover image.  Even after reading the book, I'm still surprised at how much more I don't want to read from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think you will be able to convince me that this book was a success.  I was pretty much hooked right from the cover:  I would like to give this book four stars   The book's thesis, that the way we are taught to teach the English language is an obsolete, oppressive, and outdated system is well made.  The structure, style, and structure alone should attract me to the book.   But the author doesn't make the case with any particular arguments.  Instead, he offers no real evidence to support his claims and his conclusions.  When I realized this, I just wanted to throw this book across the room.  What, I wondered, is he getting at?  I'm sure he has the answers in his mind, but they just don't click with me.  He is so sure about his ideas that he comes off as arrogant.  His writing style is so dry and pedantic that I had to force myself to take some of the ideas seriously.  You may find his arguments compelling, but I don' t think he really gives me enough to support them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's terrible.  The book is based on a true story of an unfortunate tragedy, and although the author used the real event as a theme, her actual writing style is atrocious.  In the beginning of the book, she begins by describing a strange man who was shot in a park.  I'm not sure if this is intentional, but the story doesn't move forward in a normal direction until the real murderer is found, which is then never mentioned again.  Also, at some points in the book we learn that the writer didn't even bother to research the actual event.  At another point, she writes:  "The name of this man was John Doe. " Doe" is supposed to refer to a "sodomite." " Doe " doesn't refer to any specific individual. " But why does this bother me?  It doesn't give me any pleasure to read a novel where the author is so desperate for a plot twist, that she just changes the name of the murderer to a completely different person.  It isn't until the second part of the story that we find out about Doe's actual identity.  Finally, the entire plot is so poorly written that at least I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My husband and I purchased this book at a library sale. We enjoyed it very much, but found it not very interesting. We returned it and bought it again, hoping that we'd found something that was better than the second edition. We were wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book, especially as a young adult. But I can't help but feel that the book is written in a way that is less helpful for young people trying to figure out their own lives. For one, there are several quotes that seem to suggest that young people in the United States are more likely to have substance abuse issues than their elders are. The book ends with the statement: "The only thing that's been known to stop drug use is a good dose of reality." Well, no, there's plenty of reality. But what if a young person has been abused by their own mother as a child? The mother was an addict herself. Her own drug use may have caused the problems that were causing the abuse in the first place. But then, if the mother was abused by her father and that child came to be a drug user as a result, can that child really be blamed for the abuse?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book with great interest because I've been interested in Buddhism since reading a review of it by one of my professors (and because I'm writing a story about one of the other professors' teaching in college). The book itself is a lot of fun to read, but the author's presentation is a bit too slick. She seems to be trying too hard to sell a specific religious perspective (Buddhist) on the idea that the purpose of life is to help other people.  This idea is so prevalent in the popular culture that it's taken as gospel, so much so that I found myself thinking that Buddhism should make the same claim. The thing is, there is not one iota of evidence that the religious concept of karmic retribution, which is the basis for Buddhism's emphasis on compassion, actually works.  The idea that there is no reward or punishment in the universe is also an illusion, a product of human psychology rather than reality.  To be frank, it sounds more plausible that the universe was created in a hurry to benefit people rather than for anyone's own betterment.  Maybe it was God who figured out that humans are the only creatures who would be able to handle it and that he'd get off easy if humans died on the way.  I would probably prefer to believe that life is actually a waste of time and that life in fact consists of little more than suffering.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an avid reader of children's books, but I'm very disappointed with this one. The story, the characters and the plot are all fine. But the writing style is awful and the spelling, grammar, and punctuation are all off. At first I thought I was just getting old and not up on current grammar, but in all the years I've been writing books for children and teens I'm still pretty ignorant. It's a real shame that a book that's supposed to be entertaining for a whole family can be so horribly written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem with this book is that it never gives any concrete evidence about any of its claims, and the reasons given are usually based on speculation rather than fact.   A major thesis of the book is "If you love it, you should be willing to work for it," but this is never clearly and convincingly explained.  A few times the author discusses the idea that "You shouldn't always be on the winning side," but doesn't explain the relevance of this in any way.  Another thesis is "You can't help who you love," but again it's just a little bit of speculation.  For the most part, the book just repeats and reaffirms the ideas and ideas the authors already have. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping that "the more you know" about some obscure historical event, the less you have to read it to understand it. "The War of 1812" was supposed to be a light novel. It is not. It reads like a textbook about an obscure historical topic. It goes through the major players and explains the major events. It does not give examples of their personalities, or their actions. It gives only dates, places, and actions. The plot is simple: War is bad. Bad for everyone. It might not be that bad. Maybe not as bad as the British did in 1745, but not so good as the Americans did in 1812. However, the ending suggests that the war was worse than that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started reading "The Power of Habit" (by Charles Duhigg) in the summer of 2009 and finished it in early 2010. This book was a bit of a letdown.  I have been doing something I enjoy for a long time, and Duhig is the one who says it is good for you.  It is a book about habits (hustle and saving), but he does not go deep enough.  He talks about how one should "keep a journal," which I think is just a dumb way of saying write down something you should do.   He also talks about exercising and dieting, which I can understand, but he makes it sound easy.  Duhiga is correct that some habits (eating healthy and exercising) require time and energy, but I do not believe we should waste our time and our energy on things that we are not sure about, or that we cannot afford.  So my review is more of a recommendation.  If you enjoy habits, if you enjoy reading about habits, and if you do not know much about habits except that they are good for your health, and you do enjoy a good book, please give this book a shot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book for more than a decade, and every time I give it 5 stars I have trouble with one small problem.   The entire plot is about a woman who dies from cancer and then is reborn.  She is called a "spitfire" by some people because she comes back from the dead.  I suppose some people would like a book that comes out of nowhere, and a few who have had serious illness might like that too.  But I don't.  In fact, the more I think about it, the less it appeals to me.  If the main character is a woman dying from cancer, there's no reason to resurrect her and then be reborn as another woman.  And that's what happens in this book.  So why should I give this book a full 5 stars? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book so I could write a positive review about it.  The book is called,  "How to Be a Highly Effective Speaker,"  and it's about how to become a highly effective speaker.  Here's what the book says about why you should become a better speaker:  "It's no secret that highly effective speakers know how to be effective. But just how do they do it? Here are four simple truths: 1) The key is to speak the truth.  If you want to be a successful speaker, you need to get your facts straight, make a few adjustments and deliver the message with passion.  2) Always, always, always tell a story.  There is nothing worse than a speaker who talks about something he or she has done but doesn't share the story of the real reason.  3) The truth is worth more than a thousand words.   4) There is only one thing that is absolutely essential to getting your point across.  That is passion. In order to be passionate, you must be excited about what you're saying.  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to read this book about the women's movement that I kept hearing about it from friends. I finally picked up a copy and saw the photo on the back cover and my reaction was to scream "It's them again!" Unfortunately, that's the best review I can do for a book I found so insipid and overrated. While there were a few interesting insights and observations, I'm more disappointed in the book itself than I am about the movement. It's a collection of personal accounts that lack nuance and are written by people who were either in the movement for a short time, for very short time (e.g. a year) or have no idea what they are talking about (e  This book is just another one of those that can't be ignored. It reads like a collection from Oprah. I'm not even joking. It is nothing but "The View" in book form. Oprah would have a field day with this book. She is obsessed with this movement and knows everything about it. If she can figure out the secret to a successful business then anyone can. It can't help her that she's the only person to ever be in this movement.   The only good thing about the book is that I think that in some ways, we as women can learn from this movement as much as they can. Oprah seems to think that we are all just out to get rich or stay home and have babies. Well, I think we're all doing that, but not for the same reasons. We're trying to make a good living or support our families, but there's a difference between doing what is right and doing what works. If the movement is really about women giving up everything they have to chase success then you can bet they'd be doing that too. Not the best way to promote women's rights. And that's what this book is all about.   the book reads like an Oprah special.   to be fair, it's pretty good. I was surprised that Oprah didn't pick a different book to share. I wouldn't have picked this book, but the title gave me a hint.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have preferred a book which wasn't so relentlessly negative as this one. But it seems that even "bad" books are still popular enough to be worth reading. I'm glad it's not my cup of tea, but I'm not going to be stopping this book anytime soon.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a nutshell, this is an attempt to give a general overview of the history of women in early Islam. I think it is very much at odds with the actual book and the historical record, and I found it difficult to follow at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't normally read books about psychology, but this one I just couldn't put down. The book is packed with fascinating data about how our personalities are shaped by our experiences, so I was fascinated to read about this part of psychology: "The more the subject is subjected to a negative event, the less he is likely to be affected by positive events."  I have to say, I had a very difficult time putting this book down.  One thing that annoyed me was the claim that people will become more "psychological optimists" if they are shown positive photos of their children.  That's a completely ridiculous claim to make, especially when the author has no statistical evidence for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been trying to read this book for a long time now. This is not my first trip to the library.   At one point I find myself wishing that I had taken this book to the book shop.  And I've heard about some of the "gripping" moments from the book.  But that's all I can think of.  I had some serious struggles with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was an extremely unpleasant read. I have no idea who the author is, but if anyone needs a crash course in how to hate an author, this is it.  The main character, a middle-aged woman who is a lifelong resident of a poor, run-down neighborhood, describes the neighborhood as being a "ghetto" and the "poor folk" who live there as being "thugs" and "snitches."  Her comments on what a great time she had being a teenager in the 1960s are equally cringe-worthy.  She claims that the police treated her fairly and that the kids her age weren't exactly bad kids, but she's obviously not old enough to remember that time.  Her relationship with her mother and her sister is equally cringe worthy, as are the few times she gets her hopes up about her future: "Maybe one day I'll be able to move away and never look back," she says to her sister as she begins to cry. "I'd hate to see my neighborhood turn into some other ghetto."  If she could find a job as a clerk at a grocery store, she'd save enough money to move to a more affluent neighborhood and "turn my life around."  I didn't find much joy in the book, so I wouldn't recommend it, and I've already read several good books on the neighborhood that I plan to pick up when I go on my next vacation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main reason for this book's poor sales is the author's utter and complete ignorance of current and relevant medical science, particularly of the biological role of nicotine. This is an unfortunate problem, because nicotine is one of the most important chemicals present in tobacco products, and its use (and abuse) may very well be responsible for the huge health problems that plague America today. While we could argue that the poor sales for this poor book are attributable to the fact that it is "obviously an over-exaggerated defense of the virtues of smoking" (from an otherwise competent reviewer), I have a much more complicated problem with the book.  It's an abomination, a pathetic attempt to turn "harmless tobacco use" into an offense punishable by death.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title should have been changed to "I Can't Understand What Happened When I Was Born." The story is very much about the author, but the characters are entirely invented, and never come alive.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's like someone wrote a bad biography about someone they knew well.  It is so badly written that even the things the writer says about his subject, while true, are so exaggerated as to be unimportant.  I would never have believed that he was a true "hardliner," but the author's insistence that "he was the only politician on the scene who actually believed in the basic principles of freedom" is so far from the truth that I was left wondering just how he knew such things.  The author makes a good case that Richard Nixon was a conservative at heart, but the evidence is so weak and poorly argued that I have a hard time believing that it could be true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In spite of its being about a religious group,  The Way of The Master: A Spiritual Autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi  is a terribly superficial and, at times, misleading book.  Gandhi  describes how his own mother (a wealthy woman) tried to persuade him to become a vegetarian and how he refused  even though she was well educated and he was a bachelor.  He also describes his childhood as being one of constant and painful deprivation, but never mentions that he was born blind and deaf, or that he had an undiagnosed mental disorder  (a disease known as gout).  He talks about how his family was poor and he lived in a slum with his sister and brother, but is silent about how he spent his life working in a sweatshop as a child to support himself and his family, or about how during his lifetime he suffered from kidney disease and hepatitis  (including a rare and fatal infection known as "kala-azar"  or "the white plague").  He tells a good story about growing up in India's most famous temple, the Golden Temple, but completely ignores the many scandals involving members of the temple's religious organization, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, or SGPC.  In his autobiography he writes that he "hated" the organization, but he does not mention that it was led by his mother, a member of the group, or how he was often kicked out of the Gurdawara during a dispute with other children in the neighborhood. In fact, he writes about his life so sympathetically that I had a hard time believing that he actually was a member.  As for the history of the Sikh religion, I found some of it amusing (the Sikh warrior-prince, Tej Bahadur, was one of the most colorful characters in the Sikh history), but otherwise, it was fairly boring.  The best part of the book is when he discusses his spiritual mentor, who died only three years after he died.  When he talks about the late Gurdjieff and describes him as a "great philosopher and prophet," I felt as if I was reading a biography of a very colorful person (though the author makes it clear that he is only a nickname).  In the end, though, the book was less about his teachings and more about his personality (and that of his mother and sister), which I did not enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was absolutely terrible.  The subject of a fictional story that took place in the 1800s in France is interesting and original. It's actually pretty good and the story is well-done. The problem is that the author decides to turn this into an extremely convoluted historical fiction. What he really wanted to write was a historical novel, a fantasy novel, and a novel about French history.  It's like he decided to write a French novel and couldn't be arsed to write about anything else.  There were a lot of strange ideas that he wanted to include but he felt that the book was too big to get across on a single page, so he went back and rewrote it several times, adding and removing things at will.  So there's a lot going on that's not explained or explained away, and it all gets muddled up.  I feel like if he had chosen a different time and a different country, he would have written something more appropriate.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book. The author writes like a high school kid who got the teacher's permission to use his own notes. There are a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes, and there's a number of factual inaccuracies in the book. I wouldn't trust the book as a source of knowledge on any topic. If you want to learn about Mormonism, read up on the "Book of Mormon." If you don't know much about the Church, skip over it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I agree with most of the reviewers that the content of the book is flawed and poor, there are a couple of places where the author makes some nice, important points. She has some really good points on the effect of "self-consciousness" on the way we judge people and on the nature of prejudice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading and rereading many books about the Bible, and I have come to the conclusion that most of the writers are not even serious students of the Bible.  I am also of the opinion that the more I read the more convinced I am that the writers of the Christian Bibles were not very well-educated people.  If you are going to teach God's Word, don't have it come from the people who didn't even understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a huge fan of history books. I just find them repetitive and uninspiring. This book, however, is a total waste of time, especially for someone like me who is already well aware of the war and the atrocities it wrought on Germany and on the British.  The history itself is fascinating, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm pretty sure this book will get bad reviews.  I love the books that make you think; that provoke thought and give you the possibility of reflection; that remind you of a time in your life when you felt a great obligation to do something.  But this book seems more concerned with making you feel guilty than it does with helping you think.  In addition, I'm not sure that the author has any grasp of reality, because she claims that the Bible actually condemns homosexuality.  It doesn't!  This book is full of contradictions and factual errors.  So it's a mixed review; I enjoyed the thought provoking parts, but this book just didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A horrible book: there is no way that any of the characters in this book will be likable. The main female protagonist has no redeeming traits at all and it really isn't even her fault that she gets the worst boyfriend ever. She's so annoying that I can't stand her, and even her family members can't get past her creepy side.   It would have been so much better if the author had stuck to the basic premise of the book, that everyone has their flaws. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book as much as I hoped to.   It wasn't bad in and of itself, but it just didn't have the same impact on me as it does on some people.  If you're a fan of horror or the supernatural, you might enjoy this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book. In the title, the book claims that it's a work of historical fiction and that the characters are fictional. However, the characters appear to be very, very real, but that's not enough for a good historical novel. The characters are all over the place, and the story is totally incoherent.   I got the feeling that the author spent very little time doing any research before writing this book, and that this book just became a way to say something about the Vietnam War. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book before and was interested, but I am disappointed in every way.   A. L. Sulzberger has the right idea, but the execution is too poor to be of any use.  A long list of bad books would be far too long to cite here.  The worst offender is the novel  The Black Hawk War, which was published in 1984, when I was a junior in college and the Cold War was a very active issue.  I found it hard to believe that anything written in that decade could be worth much of the attention.  Sulzbergers' prose style was clumsy and his characters had little depth or real life.  Perhaps the most frustrating is that he tries to present a fictional war as if it were an historical one, without mentioning the real reasons for the conflict.  That is where he has gone wrong.  This book will only get a bad review if you are looking for a good read, so forget about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book.  I wasn't so convinced at first.  There was so much that didn't seem to add up.  Then, I got to the part where the main character is writing a book about himself.  The whole book was about him.  He would describe a scene in his mind.  When he was writing the scene, he was talking about it.  That was when it hit me.  For a man that can never see, talk, or listen, he had written the book. He's just a mind writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of J.K. Rowling, but this book is such a disappointment.  The whole thing is just a rehash of the "Horcruxes" series.  It has no originality at all.  While the "Book of the Phoenix" was great, it was original.  This one is just about the same thing with an even more annoying "Hermione Granger" trying to find out who the other "Hephaestus" was.  I just wanted to read another "Harry Potter" book and this one is so boring I just threw it away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're a fan of Michael Crichton or John Carter then you should find this novel a disappointment. Crichtone's writing style is clumsy, the plot is convoluted, and Crich ton is a tedious protagonist.   The action is fast and furious, and there are no real characters.  The book is full of clichés like the bad girl who is the only one who can defeat the bad guy.  Crich tone's lack of interest in developing any characters is infuriating.  He uses this book to try and make a new career as a writer but he's a mediocre writer at best.  It would be a good idea to find other authors before you read Crichtons writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book, expecting it to be a good one but didn't like it at all. The premise was the first thing I thought about: A man is shot by an undercover police officer while he's driving, and in his dying words he says, "Don't you want to go home and tell your wife the bad news?"  There was a part of me that thought that, if this was real, it should have been made into a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an avid reader of YA and this one is definitely not the one for me.  The plot is lame and the characters are flat.  It's too bad, because this is not a bad novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing but an anti-science tract that will give you cancer.   The author believes that you can't just believe in science, but also in a variety of religions and supernatural beliefs.  His book attempts to refute and explain the idea of evolution as a theory of how life began on earth.  I found his arguments rather unconvincing.  He takes a number of different scientific theories and tries to demonstrate how one of them is "scientifically" wrong, while ignoring the facts that contradict the original theory.  To take a popular example, he writes that Darwinian theory that all species of life on earth descend from a common ancestor.  The problem?  He then tries to show that the theory of evolution is not true because: (1) there is no clear evidence of a common ancestry for many groups of animals; (2) evolution requires the mutation of genetic material to produce new, genetically-different forms of a single organism; (3) evolution is "the slowest of all biological processes"  This list is pretty much all he has to offer.  As an example, I can show you that there are a lot of different ways to skin a cat.  If we were to compare the scientific method to evolution, I would say evolution is a better scientific method because we have a lot more examples that show it to be true.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an excellent book for anyone with an interest in American history, or the history of a country. There is much information, but it is often scattered around in very poorly organized fashion, or it's references to earlier works are only in the very last few pages, making it difficult to find everything you want to know.  The book was especially useful to me, as I studied American history in college. The only problem is that the book is written by a historian who doesn't even know where to start when it comes to American history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't enjoy this book. I wanted to like it more, but this is the last time I'll be reading it. The stories are too similar, the characters too flat, the plot too dull, and the characters are too weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't like books about depression. I have tried many and nothing seems to work.  I have not finished this book yet, so I am afraid I'll be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time. I read it before trying to get into a long-running series (I've read most of the characters, but I was still afraid to try this one) but now I realize it's like a bad soap opera: You'll want to stop watching once the final episode ends, but you'll keep watching just to see the characters get their comeuppance. In the end, it all just feels too convenient.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible.  It contains not one but two blatant and outright false statements about Mormonism.  First, there is a lengthy section that begins with a discussion of a supposed book of Mormon, The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain, written by George S. Gibbs, and ends with an assertion that this book proves Joseph Smith was a fraud.  Gibbs' book is actually a compendium of anti-Mormon literature, but is presented as being part of a collection of "official" Mormon documents from 1829.  Second, there's an entire chapter about Joseph Smith's supposed "magic" seer stones, which is entirely based on the work of a man named Oliver Cowdery.  Cowder  I really did not enjoy reading this book. It was poorly written and badly written for a good reason: the author, after several paragraphs of bad arguments against Mormon doctrine, makes three outright false claims that deserve to be called out as such. The first is that the Book of Mormon has no reference to ancient American magic.  No reference to the Book or to the gold plates?  It is true that the Mormon Bible does not mention magic, but I am not sure why he thinks that there is no mention of "magic and seerstones in the Book" in the first place. The second false claim is that Joseph Smith wrote in a "turgid, self-important manner."  This is a common accusation against Joseph Smith, but it's a common claim even in the 19th century.  This accusation is actually more convincing as a defense of Joseph Smith than the accusations of his critics, since it also makes the claims about his personality believable.  The third false claim, and the main reason for my poor experience with this book, is the book's repeated references to the "Joseph Smith and Moneydiggers" affair in Palmyra in 1825-26.  I think that is a reference to a newspaper account from the day, not an actual event.  A "Joseph and moneydiggers affair" would be an event in which Joseph Smith became a money digger in Palmaria, New York, after hearing of a fortune buried there.  In other words, the accusations leveled against Smith by anti-mormons were not actually about Smith, as such, but about his enemies.  To state that the Joseph Smith and money diggers affair was "the most damning proof ever offered that Joseph was a liar" is
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book because it was recommended by a friend. I am not going to lie and say I enjoyed it, but I am disappointed.  It is not a bad read, but it fails on several levels.  First of all, I feel like the author is writing from the perspective of someone who has just gotten out of a bad relationship.  He talks about how his ex-girlfriend cheated on him, how much she wanted to be with him, and how it's not fair for him to ask for her back since they are no longer "together."  He then spends a lot of time describing the breakup in detail, and it was really hard for me to not feel like I was reading the words of a broken person.  If it was just him writing, it might be acceptable, but the way he tells the story makes it seem like it was someone else's fault.  In addition, he seems to assume that he has always had the right to decide what his girlfriend is doing with her life, or at least that his feelings are as valid as hers.  While I can understand someone being frustrated that their partner is having an affair and might want to find someone else to share it with, this is a very narrow and outdated view of a healthy relationship.    Thirdly, it doesn't make sense why he would have a book about sex written by someone who is still in a long-term relationship. I would have been interested in reading about the other side of the relationship, but now I just want to read about the guy's sex life.  These things are supposed to be separate, but they're actually connected, and the author needs to figure that out.  Lastly, the ending just comes out of nowhere.  I'm not trying to be critical, but this book just felt so out of place in the overall plotline that I wasn't interested in keeping reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I do like the overall tone of this book, the author fails at a number of things. First, as a self-described "Christian apologist" I was somewhat surprised to learn that all of his book is based upon his own beliefs, not on the Bible. As a result, I have found no place where he presents the Bible in the context of apologetics. That aside, I find it particularly unfortunate that he uses passages that are clearly based upon ancient sources to support his claims.  He quotes many scholars who say the Bible is not the word of God (such as John Calvin). I don't care much for John Calvin, but he wasn't a "Christian," and he wasn 't a "apologist."  He's not a very reliable writer either.  His book was not very well reviewed in the New York Times  (it was not that well reviewed) and he has never published anything else (although he has published several articles and essays that are worth reading).  Despite these issues, I'm going to read it anyway because I think it's a worthwhile book for those who have studied the Bible and are looking to read something that's more "neutral" than the usual fare. It was definitely interesting to read the various defenses of certain Biblical passages. I am very impressed with a number that claim the Biblical passages are just historical documents and therefore, there is nothing problematic with them.  I agree with the first argument, but the second argument falls apart when one attempts to read these documents in the historical context that they were written in.  One of the arguments in this book is that Jesus was not a good person because he was a pacifist. I didn't like the argument because it wasn't based on the facts.  A good Christian is a good pacifist too. The other argument is that the New Testament writers are biased in favor of the Gospels and the epistles. Again, I didn 't like the first, as it was written from the perspective of an evangelist.  The other, written from a different perspective, was much better.  While the New Testaments were written long after Jesus, they were still influenced by his teaching and the other "gospels" were written to be used as a guide for the "good news."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best part about the book is the epilogue, which explains the original reason for the book's existence: it's supposed to be a warning to American conservatives not to take their religious ideology too seriously. But in practice, the book reads like a piece of bad satire, which I thought was very funny. The authors' goal was clearly to ridicule the fundamentalist right, but instead they've actually done the opposite.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My parents bought this book for me as a Christmas present but instead of reading it to me the whole time as I requested, they decided to throw it away and never read it again.   A lot of the plot is unbelievable.  I didn't believe a single thing that was said, but it didn't really matter since it didn�t seem to affect me that much at the time.  This isn't just a bad movie. It�s a terrible book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am in my late 60s and I've read many books about relationships but none of them were as good as this.  It's like the two most brilliant people in my life have worked together to craft this book so perfectly.  The subject matter is very difficult to cover adequately in one volume, but they managed it in a way that made it fun, entertaining, and helpful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with this book, because while it deals with the very real problems that many people have with their gender dysphoria, the overall impression is that the author just wants to get rid of trans people: the transphobes.  They're just too troublesome; people who need to be educated and treated for their medical issues are just too difficult.  To have an accurate and well written look at trans people who might actually be a positive asset to society would've been nice.  This doesn't really happen in this book.  It doesn't explain how it's possible for trans people to be great friends to many cisgender people, because the author has never been able to do that, so it's difficult to understand.  As a transwoman, she clearly has a lot of respect for transmen, but doesn't seem to realize that some transmen are very good friends to their cisgender partners.  She also seems to have trouble grasping how the cisgender community can be very supportive of trans women.  I'm all for people being supportive of their trans neighbors, but it seems like it might've been easier to have a conversation about how to be more supportive instead of just dismissing trans people out of hand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book. The synopsis was pretty much what I was hoping for: a love story between a teenage boy and a high school teacher in the 1950s. Unfortunately, I found it to be far from what I had anticipated. The story involves a girl who is obsessed with an older boy. Her boyfriend thinks this girl is cute, and he frequently takes her on outings, where they have sex. The older boy has sex with her as well, but then he decides he wants to marry her. This girl is really upset by this, because she has always wanted to be married, and now that she is getting older, she is worried she won't be able to find someone. She is told by her boyfriend that she will have to marry the younger boy first. He gets a job at a local college as a tutor and a librarian. He is also the father of the younger girl's younger brother, and she is not allowed to see her. The younger girl is also jealous, because her boyfriend has sex more often with her mother. She tries to seduce the older man, but he rejects her advances. She then goes to the older boyfriend's office to tell him that she isn't interested in marrying him, but rather wants to be with the younger boyfriend. This guy is the teacher of her younger brother's class, and as he turns her away, she takes his coat, and flees. She ends up in the basement of an abandoned church, and the only person there is a nun. She tells her that if she does not marry the older boy, he will not be able find another wife for his family, and her brother will die soon. So the young girl runs off to marry him, and goes on to have a happy life with him for years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for a class assignment.   It was boring, with lots of facts but few stories.  The author also included two historical accounts (both very brief) about the Civil War without providing anything of substance to support either account.  Unfortunately, I finished the book thinking that this book is a bad joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in a public library and it was interesting but not very interesting.   It was really just a long list of things to think about and I found myself drifting off.  I'm trying to avoid these kind of books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise of this book is that the earth has become so overpopulated by humans that it will soon explode into an apocalyptic apocalypse, which will leave most of the people there dead. There's a lot of evidence for this, but the book doesn't really do anything to support it. For starters, the book was published in 1983, during the peak of the "population bomb" scare, which was very much a thing back then. (I'm still a little suspicious that this book's author has no idea about the term "populationbomb".) Also, the "Earth is going to be destroyed" argument comes up a lot, but very little is shown to prove it.  The biggest problems are: (1) Earth isn't going to explode; the world population will continue to grow until the last person on Earth is 100. (2) Earth hasn't been exploding any longer than it has been growing.  (3) The book is pretty thin, even by its own standards.  If there's one thing I dislike in this book, it's that it's so thin. I know the premise is bogus, but that doesn't mean the author needs to make the book's arguments so flimsy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I wanted to learn something new about how women are viewed in today's society.  It seemed pretty reasonable, and it was definitely a worthwhile book to read.  Unfortunately, it ended up not being that useful to me.  The biggest problem I had with it was that I got a completely different idea from the author than I had initially.  Women's appearances seem to have almost as much effect on the opinions of men as their physical appearance does.  Even though this is clearly a stereotype, and not a fact, it does not make it any less true, especially in the age of reality television.  I found that I did not think that women had much of a role in the modern family because the stereotypical family consisted of the husband and the mother.  At times, I thought it was just as likely that the husband was the breadwinner because he was the only one working.  As it turns out, most of the time, the wife is working and does most of what the husband does (at least in the US).  I felt like I was being "educated" about this issue, and I wasn't.  This book does not have an easy solution to this problem (at all, in fact).  It also leaves the reader with the impression that the male gender is completely unimportant (again, a stereotype) and that women are just as "important" as men.  While I am generally against stereotypes, it would be nice if authors would stop stereotyping women and start taking female characteristics into consideration before trying to assign them a negative or positive role. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even read a lot of books about the Middle Ages. I've heard good things about this one but I'm so unimpressed it makes me want to skip it, which is exactly the opposite of the effect I was hoping for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually have bad books on my shelf but this one is bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never liked a book by the author before, but I think this one is a miss. It tries to address all the big issues that the American Revolution is known for, but it tries to do too much, and just does not connect. The main character is almost identical to an 18th century American, and his views on America are almost identical as well, and yet the two are very different. It is an interesting story about a young man who is inspired to do something positive for his community, and he ends up being a bad role model for the people around him, but as a whole it is a very confusing book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a book reviewer, so I've read and reviewed countless novels.   My absolute favorite is, without a doubt, The Lord of the Rings.  I've been trying to read the next book in the trilogy, The Silmarillion, but haven't been able to make it past The Fellowship of the Ring.  But I'm definitely not going to put that down! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing was awful. It seemed to be written with an attitude that had just been written down in the middle of the page.   I found that the narrator was often either boring or trying to be witty.  It was almost as if the narrator felt he had something to prove to his readers.  I couldn't take the voice of the narrator seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book mainly for the book club I am in.  Although the stories are interesting, the writing itself is awful.   Most stories take place in some sort of fantasy/horror movie, which gives them the feel of being written by a kid who is having trouble being brave and independent and goes and watches some movies for the first time.  Even in the good stories (the ones that don't have any kind of fantasy elements), the writing is so bad that it's impossible to tell what the characters are actually thinking.  The writing is also so bad, that I started going through the stories looking for mistakes in grammar or spelling.  I even went to the web and found a story where the same story writer (the narrator of these stories) was praised for how well written the stories were.  It's almost as if people who write about children's books expect the writing to be perfect because they read the books when they were children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, written by a former professional in the field, is just awful. It has such a big ego in the way it frames and presents its problems, and yet can't help but say things like:  "Many critics find the book unpublishable because of its many glaring errors, but I do not."   It's as if he's trying to write a critique of an earlier publication (which is fair) but it's not quite clear why he's taking such particular exception to the errors he finds there.   And it's as though he's not sure what he's talking about:  He tells us, for example, that some of the studies on the effects of alcohol on work performance are based on an unrealistic definition of "productive work" that requires little, if any, physical labor.  But, the studies actually used a definition of work that required little or no physical labor at all.  This study found that while beer-drinking had no effect on an employee's productivity, a drink did seem to have a deleterious effect on a person's memory.  "The effect is quite significant," the study concluded.  I'm glad that "few readers will find this work objectionable, " he admits,  but I doubt he's referring to this study.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the title implies, this book is really about how much it sucks to be young and stupid, and it's all made worse by all the stupid teenagers who populate it.   It's pretty bad when a book is so much more fun to read than it is to actually be reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best part is how you can use all these techniques to write an article on the exact same topic.   This book is so awesome that you just want to use the strategies in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book on a recommendation from another friend. I was so excited about it, I didn't wait long for the paper copy to arrive. I read it immediately and found it terribly disappointing. There is so little actual discussion in the book about anything important. It is all about how we, as people, have been wronged by evil women, and how we need to get over it. If that's what I think of myself, I'm a lot more likely to do something about it than this book suggests. It also claims to be about a man who was the victim of a brutal and violent attack, but does not provide any details about the attack or the circumstances that surround it. That's a good sign of an unreliable book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have loved reading the works of Mary Renault for decades, but this one was so disappointing.   The characters were so flat and two-dimensional, the plot so badly constructed and the pacing so slow that I began to wonder if the book was written by a college freshman on her first book.  Even worse, the only woman in the story is so flat that I had to turn to the male characters for the emotional depth that is supposed to be provided by women.  If this story had been written by one of the many great male authors in my lifetime, it could have been good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The "new-age" aspect of the book is a complete fail. There are a few good points in the book, and the author's perspective may be of interest to those who do not believe the traditional religious system to be the only "true" path to God, but they are completely drowned out by the over-exaggeration, over-use of "spiritual" terms, and by the author taking the position that "everything that happens is God's will."   This is not the way I view God, and this book does nothing to convince me otherwise.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very pleased with the cover and the description of the book.  I would like to see a few more chapters written by a female author in this genre, though.  The story itself was very well done, but the subject matter was disappointing.  There were a lot of stereotypically American issues at play here, such as women's roles in war, the importance of good cooking and cleanliness, and the need to save money.  This was unfortunate because I found the main characters interesting and the book interesting and entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It reads like a poorly-written attempt to explain a complex mathematical equation (it doesn't work that way) with an unrealistic plot.  The characters are flat, uninteresting, and the math is over-simplified to the point of being incomprehensible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not entirely sure I really "got" anything from this book, other than the general idea of "the mind is a terrible thing to waste." I'm a huge fan of the "wisdom" genre, and although I have been taught that some things can be learnt by listening to others talk about them, there are certain truths that we can learn only through experience. The book suggests that "learning" is possible in a wide variety of situations, but it has nothing to do with having the ability to be enlightened by hearing what others have to say. It has to do, instead, with learning what you can from the people who have been through a particular experience, and being able to apply it in your own life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not find anything of interest in this book. It is very boring and repetitive. The only other interesting topic that I am aware of is the way in which certain women have used their children as a pawn in their battles with their husbands.  This may have some relevance to the book's subject matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an avid fan of the James Bond books, and I read the first one at the recommendation of a friend who had been in love with Ian Fleming's writing for many years.  It turns out that Ian Fleming himself was also a fan of his.  This book is a hodgepodge of Fleming's early works, such as Dr. No and Thunderball, with some additional plot developments and characters that were developed in later books, such the novels Casino Royale and Die Another Day.  There are a few minor errors and other oddities, but it is all entertaining.  However, Fleming's novels aren't nearly as good as his other novels.  I liked this book just fine, but not as much as Casino Royale or Die Another Way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you love the Grateful Dead, this book will be disappointing.   The authors describe some of the Grateful dead's greatest and most obscure performances on stage, the first one being from 1970 and the last one being 1972.  They claim that Jerry Garcia was a "deadhead" since the start of their career and that he was obsessed with the dead.  He was actually the bass player for the band from 1966-68, but he was removed from the band after the 1968 shows and didn't start playing bass again until the 1970 tour.  If they think Garcia was such a fan of the dead, he should have been interested in the Grateful.  It's true that Garcia was the bassist for the Grateful from the start, but Garcia didn't become obsessed with them until 1970.  After the 1970 shows, Garcia and the band began working with many other musicians (the drummers, keyboardists and bass players), but he didn't like to do that and he didn?t play with them in any of the 1970 tours.  This doesn?t mean that he wasn't a Deadhead, he was a Dead head and he played with the Grateful until they had enough of him.  I was in the Dead when they started and I never heard Garcia talk about the dead as much as he does in this book.  Garcia didn? t like his playing with others and he often talked about how much he loved the Grateful, but that doesn? t mean that Garcia never really loved the dead in his life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my opinion, this book is very, very bad. The writing is weak, and the characters are thin, stupid, and incapable of moving the plot forward.  It's a shame because the premise is intriguing, and a couple of characters could have been interesting to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning I loved the book, but as the book went on it started to get boring and the explanations just got turgid. In order to really get a sense of what was going on I had to go back and pick it up again, which would have been a pain in the ass but at least it would have given me something new to read to fill the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you don't like Harry Potter then  you won't like this book either.  The main characters have a lot of charm but the characters in the second half have a little more depth.  A lot of the characters don't really get much development and they end up as generic "smart-ass" characters.  Some of the side characters are boring as well and are used way too much.  I don't think this is a bad story but there were times when I wanted to put the book down because it was so boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really bad, and so are most of those I've read.   It's full of a lot of poorly-written fluff, like "what do you like to do with your free time?", "did you ever want to take a vacation?", "where do you go to get the best food", and "when did you last feel loved?"  These are all things that I know nothing about, and yet are the kind of things I ask my friends about.  If I were asked my "favorite" hobbies, my answer would probably be "making food, doing gardening, and going on walks".  This author should stop trying to give me fluff about his life and instead write something that people will actually read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I said earlier, this is a very good book. I have read a couple of books on the subject of religion, but this is by far the best. But it doesn't help much with the rest of the book either, since it is really about why religious people do bad things.   I wish that she'd take this topic and do a whole book on it instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of errors that one has to wonder whether or not it was written by an educated person.  The first sentence of the first paragraph, which states that "Joseph Smith said that his first vision was when he was 14 years old," is incorrect.  Joseph Smith actually said that "his first vision" was when "he was 14, a.m., in a grove of trees near the bank of the Susquehanna River in Harmony, Pa."  His second vision, which occurred at age 24, was "when he was in the woods praying."  While the first two vision narratives were written years apart, Joseph Smith's autobiography was written just a few months before the first publication of the two visions.  Additionally, Joseph's brother Hyrum also said that the first vision happened when he went to the woods: "While thus engaged, my mind became entirely absorbed in the contemplation of the glorious scene before me. My brother Alvin was with me; and, as I lay quietly musing upon the scene before us, he called my attention to the angel who stood over the lake with a drawn sword in his hand."  This same brother described the second vision in the same exact terms: "On coming into the grove my mind was so occupied with the scene that I had not time to say, 'What do you think you are doing?' " I then had a singular experience, and saw something as white as the whitest snow, and as bright as the sun, and it remained until the middle of the night, and then vanished. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book 3 stars but found it so terribly written that I ended up giving it zero stars. I would have enjoyed the book so much more had it been written by a competent writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and I feel like it was written by a complete moron who had never written anything good before. The characters are flat, the plot is flat, and the way the characters act is flat. It seems like the authors wanted to write about a romanticized version of the Vietnam War, but it just ends up being the opposite. I guess they just couldn't do it justice because they knew they couldn't write a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most important thing to learn from these books is that every book by a well-known writer is terrible.  There's not a single good thing about this book.  Every single sentence of this book is a joke.  And the jokes are so bad that it's hard to believe that they're meant to be funny.  I wish I could be as sarcastic and critical as everyone else about this novel, but there's just nothing funny about this one.  This novel was made to be written.  But what the heck, I'll be willing to try any book, no matter how terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book ever. There are so many flaws that I was in tears at the end. As if there was a ghost of a character from the very beginning that couldn't bear the end result.   I can't even imagine what the author was thinking when she wrote this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished The End of Evangelion. The ending seemed too sudden and too contrived to be realistic. It also doesn't really fit the rest of the series, although I did enjoy the series. I hope the creator of the TV series can somehow improve this ending
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I agree with a number of criticisms in this book, I did not find the story or characters to be especially interesting or interesting enough to warrant re-reading.  A number of the characters were flat, undeveloped and uninteresting.   Some of the dialogue was cringe-worthy as well, with characters talking about the same old thing over and over.  Other characters, such as the "hero", who is a malevolent witch, were also uninteresting and just there to give exposition.  Overall, the characters lacked personality and interest.  The story was interesting enough and the plot was compelling, but not enough to sustain reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to like this book, but found it tedious.  Although she tries hard to show the dangers of extreme religious zealotry, I found her work tedious and the examples lacking.  This book is a study of the Christian belief system from the perspective of an atheist, and even though she is careful to point out that her main point is not to attack the Christian faith but to expose the irrational and self-defeating nature of religion, she has to use a whole lot of anecdotal evidence to do so.   This also causes her to become rather defensive and defensive as she tries to explain away all the problems she has discovered in her research.  It is like a series of academic papers, but without the academic rigor.  I gave it three stars because it is well written, informative, and has an intriguing argument against the Christian religion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read all of the "non-fiction" books written by John Steinbeck, and this one was the worst of the lot. It is, in fact, all the bad. The writing is lazy, the facts are not true, and the subject matter is trivial.  I am disappointed by Steinbeck's continued association with the American West and his continuing support for America's most racist organization, the Ku Klux Klan. He had been a supporter of the NAACP, but that had come to an end. Today he is a silent supporter of America's racist, intolerant, and murderous institutions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is so contrived that I felt cheated.    I found it to be so muddled that I just had to put it down.  There were so many plot holes that made the story feel so half-baked that it was unbearable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part of this book: its title. A book about the origins of the Bible is called  God Made Man  and the author's title is the same.  I didn't enjoy this book at all, but I am sure that if someone wants to spend hours poring over the origins, they will find it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As it stands, this is a dud of a book. I thought it was supposed to be a humorous account of an alcoholic's bad habits: not the kind of thing you want to pass off as serious literature. As a matter of fact, I thought I would be insulted by it, as the book claims it was based on his own observations. I got the sense that the author was trying to make a point about alcoholism in the early years of the twenty-first century. The problem is that he makes a point in an absurd way. The fact is that in the 1930s and 1940s, an alcoholic would drink until he passed out, then have a hard time getting to a bar. It was easy to get booze from a bar because the bartender was too busy to worry about checking up on customers. And since bars only had a few taps (since nobody was buying drinks from the tap), the only way to get alcohol was to go to the bottle shop and buy several cases (if he could get them at all). Then the bartender would get his case (or several cases) back from the bottlers, which were usually at least a dozen feet away, which made it even easier to get the booze. So it didn't matter whether the customer was drunk, because he'd end up in the hospital. And of course, the bartender wasn't going to check up on someone who was so wasted. So he'd be fine until somebody came by looking for a case.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because the title was just so darned apt. I've read a lot of books about mental illness, and I can't say that I find any of them all that accurate or helpful. This book certainly didn't do anything to convince me of the validity of mental illnesses, or that I'm mentally ill. In fact, it made me feel like it was all a bit of a big joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst of the bunch was "Hiroshima."  It's just such a stupid attempt to get readers to feel something about a war that occurred in the 21st century.  It is full of clichés, it's so clearly written that the authors just copy and paste from the original book.  If you read the original novel, you know that there was no atomic bombing of Japan - it was a preemptive strike by the United States against the Soviets.  So, this book has to come across as if the authors, in an effort to make their book seem better than the original, have taken the idea of the bombing and made it a part of the novel.  But the original doesn't even mention it - it's not even a part that anyone mentions in the novel itself.   It makes the entire book that much more stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My first thought on finishing a novel by a good author was that the book wasn't as good as I expected.  I thought it was a book I'd like.  The book had nice details and a good plot.  But there just wasn't much there.  When the author went into the details of each character's life, she made it sound like a novel of its time, and I didn't find it that entertaining.  Maybe I'd rather have read a good novel about someone with some talents, but not much else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My impression of this book was that it was written by a student who failed to do his homework for the test.  In fact, the book seems to make the student's failure seem less due to laziness than to poor study habits.  Even his own textbook complains of the difficulty of the assignment, saying that it's "the sort of thing that could have been easily done in the middle of the night with a few clicks of the mouse."  This isn't a typical complaint of a textbook or textbook reviewer; the reviewer is the author's academic supervisor.  The reviewer takes pains to point out that the student never actually failed the assignment and that he wasn't even in class the day the test was due. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about 3 months ago and found it to be really terrible. The protagonist's main flaw is that she is so interested in her own feelings and opinions that she doesn't understand when others disagree with her. The narrator (I thought it was a male but it seems to be female, who isn't sure what to do) spends the entire book defending this very flawed view and basically saying that people are wrong if they think that women shouldn't have opinions, especially when they don't have any. This is something that the author talks about in the first third of the book, but it only becomes a bigger problem later on. I don't even think I believe this guy!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am giving this book three stars for the way it is written.  Unfortunately, it is too much a story about how a bad marriage turned into a very bad relationship, and not enough about the main character, who I never thought would develop to such a degree.  I did like that, even if her husband was a total loser. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had this book in the hopes of reading a fun read about a bunch of teenagers getting themselves into trouble. This book is anything but fun, and has far too much angst and angst.  It is filled with the same old cliches: teen angst, awkward awkwardness, unrequited love, and the inability to do right by one's own.  These cliched problems that pop up from time to time are not unique to teenagers.  The real problem with this book is that it has no plot whatsoever.  All that happens in the first 100 pages is that we meet three of the four main characters, and we learn about them through the way they say the things that other teenagers say.  They learn a lot about themselves, but that doesn't make up for the problems the characters bring.  I felt like I had skimmed a great deal of the story, and didn't learn much about these characters.  A much better way to spend 100 pages: the characters have a conversation about being bad at soccer, and one of them reveals that he has a crush on the girl who's holding the ball.  This doesn't do anything to enhance the story other than to make the three main characters more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't give books 5 stars, but this book deserves it: it is not a good book.  A book that has a lot to recommend it is one that actually does it well and is readable and well written.  This book is nothing more than a combination of bad advice and bad writing:  1.  I was at a party recently where someone told me how they have been "trying" to get healthy with the help of a "nutritionist."  This sounds nice and appealing and makes me feel good, but unfortunately it is nothing but  fluff:  A lot of nutritionists are out of their depth and can't be trusted.  They can't even recognize healthy foods as nutritious.  The people who are getting this "training" from these folks should not feel guilty about not eating like a healthy person.   2.  Another problem I have with this book is that the author often uses the term "eating disorder" to describe a variety of problems and disorders, such as overeating, body image issues, and anxiety.  She does not define the actual disorder, or provide any evidence that these problems have anything to do with eating disorders.  So she gives readers the impression that these things are related, which they are not.  3.  After telling you about the dieting and exercise programs that many people who have eating disorders have found useful, the author recommends that you keep a journal of all of your meals and snacks.  While this idea is appealing,  it is only recommended in certain cases:  For example, if you have a lot of body fat (which I do) or you are having trouble getting your period (which is common), you should probably try to get a good night's sleep (which you can do just fine) or exercise more.  Even in those cases, though, she does not mention that these are some of the best ways to improve your health and keep it.  4.  There are many sections in the book that mention "good books" and then don't provide any examples.  For instance, I found an interesting fact about the ancient Greeks:  Their average height, weight, and BMI were in between the average heights, weight and BMI of modern Americans.  In the ancient Greek world, a diet high in meat and fats was more healthful than a diet low in animal products.  When modern people read the ancient writers, they get the idea that meat and fat are
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry.  I've heard so much good about this book.  It's a really good idea, but it just doesn't work.   A lot of the stories about how women cope with grief seem very generic.  What makes the grief so bad for the women in the book is that, unlike the men, they don't get to blame anyone else.  This is particularly true in the story about the woman who got into a fight with her husband.  There's nothing she can do about the fact that he molested her.  In a similar case, in the end the man had to step in to defend his wife.  The woman doesn't blame herself for what he did to her. In fact, she's really grateful he's defending her from the evil that he's done to her (i.e. molesting his wife). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so anxious to get to the end of this book, I read through it before it was published. I wasn't so enthused about the book after I finished reading it.  I didn't feel that any of the points that the author had made really helped.  It was all so vague and hard to follow, which made the book a struggle.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was good, but the content, i.e., the poor story structure, makes the book a chore to read.   I don't want to say anything bad about this book, but it is an absolutely terrible, badly written book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of Anne Lamott's work. I've loved every one of her books and her recent work in the New York Times Bestseller list was a huge success. But in the introduction to her new novel, "Suffering in Silence" (also published in paperback) Lamott reveals how she "lost her own voice and became a writer of books about people with mental illnesses.""I was so disappointed that in a book about mental illness I ended up describing a schizophrenic in excruciating detail in order to give a fictional treatment of schizophrenia a scientific veneer," Lamott told the New Yorker in 2006. "I thought it would have been better if I had described him as a brilliant mathematician and inventor rather than as a lunatic. But then I realized I couldn't say anything meaningful about the mathematician. I couldn, however, say anything about his brain.""What Lamott describes is a psychotic breakdown in which he has no contact with reality. He cannot hear sounds, is incapable of understanding spoken words, has no sense of smell, taste, sight, or touch, and cannot follow a simple command.""I don't know if I'll ever understand what he's doing to himself or what he must be doing to be in such pain. And I wonder if he realizes that he's going to die.""I couldn't imagine a more frightening life. I am not a scientist. And in my experience, science is always wrong. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to be honest with you, and it might surprise you to learn I really enjoyed this book.  I really thought it would have been a really good book when I first started reading, but I never really got into it.  This was my second book from the series (the first one being  A Man at the End of Time )  and it was a total disappointment to me.  It was filled with a lot of unnecessary and distracting details.  At one point there's a discussion about how the characters use the phrase "the great book" as if that were some kind of title.  They use it as if it were a title for a book. I have never heard it that way before.  There was also a discussion of what the characters would eat if they had to "survive."  What would that entail?  I understand the point of the book, but it just sounded like a way to show the characters as they were rather than as they are.  Overall, the book was too pretentious for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't normally give 4 stars but this book is just so bad, I couldn't resist.  This book is filled with so many obvious errors that one wonders why the author bothered writing it.   The book starts out with a chapter that states that the Qur'an is filled, to quote the author, with "insidious errors" and goes on to say that "there is nothing that the [Qur'an] is not wrong in".  I can't find that anywhere in the book.  In fact, the book does nothing to prove anything in the Qurʾan is wrong.  The only errors in the Qurʾanic text come in the form of the words "alayhi" and "wāwah" that appear in many places in the text.  I know that Arabic is full of similar sounding words that look the same but in fact have very different meanings.  However, this is an entirely different category of errors that the author failed to see.  He mentions that the word "wahy" means "good" and he gives the example of "the sound of a good car" but that makes it sound like "wawal" means bad.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have much else to go on and I don' t think he was really paying any attention to the text in the first place.  His claim about the Quranic errors is also somewhat flawed.  It seems that when he is being more literal (and not as literal as he usually is), he says "It has not been corrupted by anything except the changes in the human heart".  The problem here is that he does not seem to realize that this is the only example he has given in the entire book.    What exactly is "the change in the heart"?  The author claims that this occurred "when Muhammad discovered that it was the Arabs who were in charge of the Quraysh, who had previously been in control of Arabia" (p. 15).   Why then is the Qurṭān full of these errors?  I find it hard to believe that when the Arab tribes conquered the Qurayzah, the Qurans couldn't figure out a way to get back their control.  If Muhammad had come across that information in his travels, he would have changed the name of the Arabic tribe the Qurāzah were from in his book. However, he is so intent on proving that the
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the midst of all the other good books and short stories I was reading, I happened to be reading "Blessing" and I found it tedious, tedious, and tedious.   The characters were either flat or annoying, the dialogue was tedious, the plot was flat and uninteresting, and the story itself was tiresome.  Even though it's "a" historical work, the actual events were not interesting.  I am not a fan of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad  book  that really needs an author who can be more interested in writing a quality book rather than making up stories.  I think she's trying to do the latter, but doesn't come close. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In other words, they were right about one thing: The U.S. should never have gone into Iraq in the first place. But the book is really about two things: the failed U.N. inspectors, and how we got into this mess in the second place. The "U.N." is like the U.R.V. of the Iraq War, because the book spends so much time explaining why it was so bad, it's very hard to take away anything good. This is a typical book about bad things: bad decision making, bad decisions, bad planning, bad execution, bad policy, etc.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been through a fair amount of self-help books and books on love and relationships, and I've had all of them to the point where I can't go back to them.  This one is a disappointment.  I expected something good out of it, but it is all a bunch of platitudes and not at all useful advice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a book reviewer for GoodReads, and I'm reviewing a book that's published by Random House. I found this to be pretty good. I liked the writing and the general ideas, and it got a lot of positive reviews from people who know a lot about economics. What really bothered me was that the actual implementation of the ideas was so horrible. I think the biggest problem with this book is that it does not seem to understand that markets are really different from other types of entities, and that if people have different expectations about what the economy is like, then it's harder to get everyone to share in the wealth. When it comes to the economy, it's easy to get people to share, because if you're just trying to get food to the homeless, then you can get people who are really poor to share. But what if you want to get them to share their own money? If there's a system that tries to make everyone pay at the same rate, and if you get your hands on their money, then everyone's going to resent you. And that's what happened to this author, who believed in a really bad plan to fix the economy. In my opinion, the book is a complete waste of time, and only makes me want to spend my time and money to read something that I know is going to be good. The only reason to read this book was because of all the good reviews that are out there for it, but I don't think that's good enough reason to buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's so hard to understand what's going on in a story. The book does have some great scenes, but they are difficult to grasp if you've never read a genre thriller before. The characters are very shallow and lack any depth. You'd think a detective who is constantly on the look out for missing people would have some semblance of a personality, but no, just a cold-hearted machine.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a total and utter disaster. It is like reading someone's bad novel, only worse. The language is so bad it makes the author's previous work seem like a high-brow romance. I found myself wishing I hadn't started this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not deserve the 5 star rating it's been getting. It is a typical book, and most of the time it is filled with repetitive and boring information. It contains plenty of advice on how to be a successful writer, but in reality, you don't have to know much about any of it to make good books. The author, Michael S. Evans, is a professional writer (at least he used to be), but the topics he discusses are so dry that they could have come from a book by someone who's an amateur writer, or a teacher who's trying to sell his own book. If you think you'll need a lot of help from this book to get better, you'll be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While I loved reading the first two books in this series ( The Eye of the Needle and The Last Lion ) I have to say that this third book did not meet my expectations.  While it is a good book overall, I feel like it fell flat.  It's too bad as it is my favorite series by Tolkien.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be woefully inaccurate. I had a great deal of difficulty following the narrative as it was presented.  In particular, it was difficult to believe that the men involved in the alleged rapes were actually guilty.  If the men were really guilty, wouldn't their mothers have been notified and given their side of the story?  If so, why did they refuse to give their version?  In addition, the woman who was supposedly raped was only 14 years old when she gave birth to the daughter who was allegedly raped.  How could a 14-year-old daughter of a woman who is six years her senior be raped by a man who is at least eight years her junior?  The fact that this mother was only nine years her own senior must have been of little consolation to her.  The only people who seemed to have a clear understanding of the situation were the people who actually committed the acts.  I don't know why people believe these men over the woman.  This book makes me think that there is something about the Bible that needs to be questioned. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.  I loved   The Da Vinci Code.  I thought this book was nothing more than another conspiracy theory, but unfortunately, I was disappointed in this book in even more ways.  To start,   the author claims to have discovered new data that disproves the theory of evolution.  While this is not new, it is new to me.  He talks about an alleged discovery that says "There is no link between human traits and intelligence."  Yes, this is supposed to disprove evolution. The implication is that if there was such a link, then it would not have occurred in humans.  However, he goes on to say that, "The only thing that can explain this finding is that it reflects the fact that evolution is not a valid theory of human origins."   What kind of a theory is that?  If you claim it is only the random mutations and natural selection that cause intelligence, then I am afraid you are a creationist.  The other errors are numerous, but perhaps the most egregious is the claim that the United States is ruled by a group of secret globalists who are secretly trying to take over the world.  This is complete nonsense.  There is no such group, and no such people.  The term "globalists" is actually used here to describe those who think that the best policy is to have a strong national government that can use force to prevent any form of international terrorism.  For example,  "A globalist strategy, which has been adopted by the Bush administration and most other nations, is the establishment of a system of so-called 'free trade' agreements. Such agreements seek to eliminate virtually all tariffs and tariffs on the trade of goods. This would greatly reduce the cost of living and of purchasing goods from abroad, while at the same time, allowing a larger military budget to be used in a fight against foreign enemies. In addition, the World Trade Organization, a U.N.-based organization, is attempting to create a new international economic order that would eliminate nearly all tariffs between nations."  A recent article in The New York Times explains this clearly:  "The term 'globalization' refers to the idea that the economic interests of nations are becoming increasingly integrated. This idea is based on the fact, for example, that U.S. companies are more likely to locate in developing countries, where labor is cheaper and regulation less strict."  "As
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a huge fan of fantasy as a genre, but I had a great time with The Girl on the Train.  I was reading the book when I noticed a couple of things.  First, there were no vampires in the book.  (My guess is that if the book had been set in a post-apocalyptic world, a vampire would have been essential.)  Secondly, I noticed that this book is very much an autobiography, as the author wrote about many of the major events that happened in her life and her life with her husband.  But the events that were most interesting to me were the ones where the author discussed her religious faith.  I will admit that I wasn't as familiar with Christianity as I would have liked, but even so, I found the book fascinating.  She describes her faith in great detail.  The fact that she was able to write about it in such a moving manner makes it that much more enjoyable.  If you like books about religion, I would recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe I wasted so much time and money on this book.  It is not really that bad of a book. But, it has no value for anyone wanting to find out what life would be like in a totalitarian dictatorship.  A lot of people who have bought this book will never go to China because it is so boring.   If you are one of them, then you are missing out on the fun of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with grammatical errors, bad history, and inaccurate information. The history of Christianity and its various sects is presented as if it were fact. This is unfortunate because it leads the reader to believe that many "heresies" are false, and that most Christianity is consistent from one generation to another. The author does not have the critical analysis necessary to understand why one sect is opposed to another, and to understand the historical context in which these sects arose. While the author is quick to point out that some groups were peaceful and "harmless," she also presents many examples of violence and intolerance. The story is full of "the good" fighting the "bad," but this is only true for the first three or four generations. After that, the "good" always loses. The only "goods" that remain are those that accept some form of persecution.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book a bit tedious and had some difficulty sticking with it as I felt I was being constantly reminded of the plot.  The characters were interesting in that some of them seemed genuinely troubled by life's problems and others were just overly self-centered, but the book was written in a way that made me feel I didn't know who I was supposed to like.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book in order to use it as a resource for my own writing.  It is, in some respects, a success: it gives a helpful and interesting overview of some of the more famous examples of popular fantasy.  But I find it very hard to believe that someone could write an entire novel based on one single scene from a famous movie -- and that the scene itself is so important and well written that it merits a whole novel in its own right.   The scene is the scene where a woman is raped by two dogs, and it is not at all clear why it is so influential.  I suspect that it is most memorable for the image: it is, as the authors themselves write, "a scene that captures the essence of horror."  The other part of this scene is what the authors say is the "core" of the scene -- the scene of the rape.  They say it is "a classic scene from the horror film The Ring," but they don't explain why.  There are lots of scenes in horror films that I find interesting, but this one doesn't seem to fit in.  What they do in their discussion of The Ring, they seem to say, is that it isn't really about the rape; it's about the aftermath.  And there is nothing wrong with this; but in this case, I think it really isn't about the actual rape.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As with so many of the novels from the '90s (the majority of which I've enjoyed), the writing is good but the story is terrible. It's obvious the author is a product of her generation, and that her own childhood is a poor basis for a story. But most of the time she uses kids as plot devices to get to the adult plot, which involves teenage pregnancies and abortion, in the wrong age bracket and on the wrong side of the law. It would've been much more interesting if she'd tried to tell a story about one of the teens instead of the other way around.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very shallow book. It seems to have been written by a man who is not very knowledgeable about the subject matter or who has not had the time to read the whole book. I think that if this was a good book that had some real content it would be a five star rating but it is just a quick read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book before I started writing, but couldn't put it down.   The book itself is very interesting.  I found it very well written, and I do agree with the conclusions.  However, the author's lack of self-awareness is just plain annoying.  When the author says he "felt the need to explain to anyone he talked to the nature of the cult" he makes me think he was one of those people the cult members have a hard time getting rid of.  He never discusses what makes cults tick or how cults usually don't succeed.  Again, he feels the need for this explanation and doesn't think it's enough.  This sort of stuff just bugs me, and it bugs me because it is a lack of perspective.  You need to be prepared to explain things to people who don't understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. This book is supposed to be about the creation of the first English-speaking nation in the Americas. Instead, it is about how an English-speaker arrived in the middle of the Aztec empire. Yes, it was the Aztecs, but who cares, when the English can be taken down with a nice bow? And how's this for a plot hole: the Aztlan people are supposed to have no religion, but we see that their gods are more or less the same as those worshipped by the Azpilicans in the first place! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read and loved The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but The Girl With the Dragon Embellished Pendant is a waste of time, talent, and money.    It is filled with over-the-top descriptions of women's faces, which are all incredibly silly and silly.  She's the embodiment of all the worst female stereotypes about how women are supposed to be: thin, ugly, desperate, and stupid.  I also find that the author is really bad at describing the various kinds of jewelry she finds as a gift for a girl.  It's like she's writing about people in an art museum or something, and is unable to describe or discuss the various jewelry because she's not really interested in it.  So she just describes the "bad ass" pieces like they're some sort of modern art, and never mentions the interesting pieces or makes references to them.  Even worse is the fact that this "expert" doesn't know how to use a pen properly, which prevents her from writing a decent description.  While this is a book that will definitely interest art aficionados, I'm really not interested in learning about what some random woman finds in her home on her birthday. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a good book for children. It is very boring and is not for children who like a challenge.  The adults who have to read this for their own kids are pretty embarrassed by it.  It is really not that good of a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the back of this book you can find a list of references, some of them obscure, some relevant. Unfortunately, none of them have anything to do with the subject matter.  I am sure they existed but were not included in the research for the book.  The book is so full of references that it would have been easy to find any references by just checking the book's bibliography.   I got a good deal of enjoyment out of the book by seeing the characters as people and not just cardboard cutout figures.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book for years and have always loved it.  It's fun.  However, this book isn't just a comedy.  The humor has been carefully crafted to be as ironic as possible.  I found the book more fun the first time through, but that wasn't enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete and utter failure. As soon as I saw that the author had a doctorate in anthropology from Yale, I was disappointed. I've never been a fan of anthropology, especially when it comes to discussing race in America and the world, and I was also surprised by the lack of research and evidence presented. What little there was made it clear that race is not determined by genes, but rather by culture and history. The book did present some evidence that some Native American populations are more genetically homogeneous than others, but that doesn't change the fact that modern America is a melting pot of different cultures. I could never understand why people with different backgrounds and values in every aspect of life can be so close. They seem to have it together, and why? Because they're smart, compassionate, and hard-working. I don't believe in "social mobility," as the author calls it, but he does argue that some groups have been able to successfully adapt to changing environments better than others. The key is to be adaptable enough to keep your identity intact and not forget where you came from. What a horrible conclusion to a perfect book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to love this book but it was so disappointing. The author, who was a good writer, had clearly read a lot about the history of slavery in the United States, but in this book he tried to write about an imaginary situation. The people in this world were mostly slaves. They lived in a feudal society in which the only way to get a job was to marry into a family, and the people of that family were the masters. It was a horrible, horrible situation to live in. Most of the slaves did not live long enough to have children and their only way out was to be sold. They were beaten, and they lived with a lack of food and sleep. All of them had to do whatever they could to survive because no one else would do it for them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is all too easy to see an American literary work as the reflection of an American intellectual tradition. But the result is that the American tradition in The Handmaid's Tale - a tradition that I believe has been very strong in America for much of its history - is reduced to a set of superficial tropes, a bunch of old and uninteresting characters, and the "author's" own personal agenda. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book on the basis of an author whose other books I'd enjoyed, and this one didn't disappoint. The plot and characters were engaging and the prose engaging enough to carry me through, but the last 40 pages or so were so poorly done that I gave up and gave up reading. I'm not sure I'd buy a book from someone who wrote like this again. It's hard for me to believe they actually had anyone involved in this project, because it just looked like a bunch of people talking over each other.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than a compilation of short stories. The stories don't make any sense. The authors say they are stories about people in the military who have never told anyone they are gay. The only reason I bought this book is because I was looking for stories about other people in similar situations and came across this book in a bookstore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book.  It is so poorly written, poorly paced, poorly organized, and poorly explained that it is difficult to tell if the author has read any other books about child abuse.  Despite all of the problems, it is still a very poor book. I give this book one star only because it is so much more interesting and readable than "In Defense of Abusive Parents" by Judith Herman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great novel that is so well written and well-written, it's like reading a great Shakespearean play. But it has some of the same problems with characterization and plot as so many of its predecessors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed that this book was published in English rather than in Spanish. I thought the Spanish version was much better than this English one and I thought that the author would have learned from my mistake and written in Spanish rather than English. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book to a class and thought it was a fun little travelogue with a bunch of quirky characters.  Then I finished it and was very disappointed in the author.  A good travel memoir is one that shows a sense of humor and that is absent here.  It was a nice bit of fun, but it was also a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title was misleading, as most of the story is told from the point of view of the girl's boyfriend.  His main character, and the main love interest, was never really "present" in the story and was only mentioned once, and that was to give the impression that he didn't like her much (although I understand his dislike for her).   They did keep him in the plot and at least made him interesting, but he never had much of an impact on the story.   I have to admit that the whole book was a disappointment, and it really felt like they wanted to focus on the "normal" teenager relationship and not the romance between the two main characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the way John Grisham wrote this one. I enjoyed it immensely, and was eager to check out his other books.  I bought the book after finding a copy of It's Perfectly Normal on the shelf at the local Barnes & Noble. It had a similar cover, and so I picked it up.  After reading the first chapter, however, I had to put it down.  The prose was so stilted that I just couldn't understand it.  There are some excellent characterizations, but Grish amuses himself at the expense of these characters, while at the same time trying to make his readers feel sympathetic toward the character in question.  It's almost as if Grish's characters are designed to appeal to a wider audience than they actually are.  Grishamn himself is more of an oddity than an interesting character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is bad.   It's so badly written that it makes one wonder how many good writers were lost to the abyss during the last two generations.  If you want an entertaining story about a man's quest to find the truth about a young woman, you could do worse than a re-hash of Stephen King's "The Shining."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all.  It's full of inaccuracies, is full of historical distortions, and is full to the brim with conspiracy theories.  The authors give their reasons for all of them, but they're all pretty weak: the evidence was collected "off the record," so the source isn't cited; the information came from the CIA, so that's a pretty weak argument; the claims of people like Edward Snowden that they can spy on anyone in the world without breaking the law is just stupid and is contradicted by the law itself; the notion that the US government wants "total information awareness" and can control the Internet is ridiculous.   The book doesn't end on a good note, though, as the authors claim that if anyone did want to expose the conspiracy, the government "would be able to find it very quickly."  I don't like the idea that people would be able find things out that would be very embarrassing to the United States, particularly when the government is so involved in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this book because it is not the standard formula for romance (e.g., male hero meets beautiful woman) with a side of supernatural (e the monster in the woods who kills people).  This book is just a lot of boring, "oh, they both are so good" stuff.  For me, that is one of the reasons I hate "genre" romance so much.  The hero is "hot" (i.e., he's very attractive, he has amazing powers, etc.) and the heroine is "badass" (e she's not afraid to do what he wants, she's smart, she kills monsters, etc.).   It's not about anything real, but it's so boring, I hate reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I finished reading this book. I am so glad I did.   The main reason for this is the great and thorough research.  The rest of the book is fantastic, but I couldn't put the book down.  I recommend this book to any interested reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best thing about this book is that you can just skip to the good stuff. There is not a lot of science involved, so the discussion doesn't drag. It's a quick read that makes a strong point and leaves the reader feeling inspired and positive about the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book 4 stars because the characters were interesting, especially the main character (a young, black girl living in New York City who goes to a private school)   But when the book gets to the point where she's in the closet and is "coming out" to her friends, I stopped reading.   The book portrays the author's relationship with her daughter as the best example of what loving a gay daughter means, while her reaction is the worst example.  The author makes the mistake of portraying her daughter's sexuality with so much love and care, only to have her go through such a traumatic response to it.  I didn't hate the book because it was anti-gay -- rather, I felt that the author should have gone further in exploring her daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not bad but not so good that it is a must-read either.   The problem is with the author.  She is a self-described "radical" who is trying to make her own point by ignoring, denying, or making up facts.  It would seem she thinks that if she says something, then people will automatically believe her.  I can't say I disagree.  Her book is titled " The Case Against 'Gender Identity' "  (but if it says "The Case for 'Gender Non-Conformity' " then it's already a lost cause), and that title makes it sound like she's making a case against gender and how people use it.  Instead, what she's really saying is that because there are so many people who think it's okay to do different things for various reasons, then all people are really really transgender.  And that's a little much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as an introductory high school reading, and it disappointed me. The narrator is pretty good, but the story is not. The author seems to have been inspired by the television show "Criminal Minds," which is very good, and gives a much better account of how the FBI conducts investigations. Unfortunately, the case that inspired the book (the murder of a prominent New York City physician) was solved without a single eyewitness. The murderer (a woman) was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, but she died in prison after a year in prison. The book mentions the case of the serial killer who killed at least seven women in the 1970's, including a young teenager. I have the book, but I can't remember the details. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so long that it literally took me 4 hours to read. The writing was good, but the pacing was atrocious. The book has lots of interesting information about how the ancient Celts were different from the Romans. However, it's just a collection of unrelated facts. There's little to no real insight in the book. The only worthwhile thing about it is that it's part of an "Ancient Celts" series on Amazon that's pretty good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited about this book. The first part looked really interesting; there were a lot of interesting questions about how people live and how they can be changed. The second part was a series of essays in which the authors asked the question, "how are people being destroyed by technological progress?" What was very frustrating is that this section is written entirely from the perspective of people who have lost out on the benefits of technological progress. The conclusion of the book, in which we read about people who managed to enjoy the benefits, was completely unsatisfying, given that they're also the people who are losing out on technological progress, and they know it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the latest in a series of rubbish books about American foreign policy from someone who obviously has never been out of the U.S. foreign policy apparatus. It begins with the usual tired anti-Americanism. We read that American foreign policies have failed and that "America is at a crossroads." Who could disagree with that? Then we get to the nitty-gritty of our country's disastrous past interventions (which are just as bad as anything by the U-boats of the previous chapter). So, our nation is going to war again and this time it's because of a bad deal with Iraq. We're going to get attacked again. Our children are going to be threatened by terrorists. Our grandchildren are going back to war. This is a classic mess-up by our government. And by the way, I'm all for American self-determination, but our government has gone overboard in this war and is going the wrong direction. It's time to slow down, take a good look at what went wrong, and correct course.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm reading a book that is not very good. I don't think it would be bad if the characters weren't so irritating. I like the idea of the book as a detective story, but the characters are too stupid and lazy to ever do anything. The ending just ruins the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about two young men who go on a pilgrimage to visit holy sites in Morocco, where they get into an argument with a local imam. I liked this book a lot and liked it a lot more after I had read it for a second time in print. It doesn't give a full account of the pilgrimage, but the first part does a good job of establishing its characters: Obeid, a devout Muslim with an affinity for the Koran; and Saad, a secular Moroccan atheist. Saad is the hero and the story takes on a spiritual tone. I especially liked the fact that the two characters had a profound effect on one another. I would have liked a little more attention paid to the people they met along the way, but that's not a major problem for me. Obeids' experiences are quite fascinating and I found them entertaining and quite moving. Saads' experiences, however, were less than inspiring. The prose is sometimes too formal. I also think that the author overstates his case that Islam can be a religion of peace. Although I don't think the book is anti-Islamic, I feel that he understates the importance of the Koran as a source for good and evil. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in college and while it was interesting, it never really stuck with me.   It did get better once I had a chance to actually read some more fiction but still it's just a not very good book that I wish I'd had the guts to read sooner.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a horrible book. The main character (a girl who goes by the name of Anna) doesn't have any real feelings for anybody and only really likes the things that make her happy, even if the things in question don't seem all that important. It's an awfully short story and Anna just keeps going and going and goes out of her way to be with the only people she's supposed to be attracted to. That's a little disappointing, especially since the main character gets to get all the guys she wants by cheating on everybody else. And all the people she cheated on are the only ones she's attracted to, which is a little annoying too. I also found the use of words to be a little odd. The book tries to be witty, but often just ends up being plain dumb. Even the dialogue is kind of wacky. It was really boring, and it left me feeling so cheated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a real bore.  The plot is really just a bunch of "What-If's".  The story is told through the "what-if's" of a few different people and their adventures.  There is one character who seems to exist only to give the author another excuse to create a "what if" character.  That character is named "Lena."  She is one of the most unappealing characters I have ever encountered.  She goes from the most caring, considerate, and nurturing person to the worst person ever in a blink of an eye.  It makes it difficult to even care about what she does.  Lena just exists for the sake of the author, rather than for the reader.  I feel bad for the character but I can't blame her for the events that happen to her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that does not live up to the hype - and I know this is a book that is highly touted by some reviewers - was not worth the money I paid for it. The book does not include a very large amount of detail regarding any of the main characters, and instead focuses on a limited number of minor characters. As a result, some of the stories have some gaps in them, which makes it hard to follow. Also, the "characters" are often "filler" who are mentioned by several other characters and then go "out of the story" or "have nothing to do" in the next chapter or two. That kind of character can be interesting and fun to watch, but in this book it's just annoying. The story itself is really bad, and the characters are really annoying. There are parts of the book that were really funny, which are almost a waste of the whole book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of young adult books, and this one took me back to the days when I was trying to figure out what to do with my life.  As I recall, there was a lot to unpack, like why you want to be a writer, or why you think a book is important, or how to handle rejection (or, to be more precise, how to deal with the things you don't want to have happen to you -- a few of my own experiences).  Although I was able to put together a fairly satisfying explanation for my interest in writing, this is still a book I recommend strongly.  I also found some good examples of how other people deal with rejection in interesting ways.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a lot of fun with this one. Not the best book I've read, but it had a good heart and was entertaining. Unfortunately, I found it lacking in plot and characterization. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is written in an obvious style, and the subject matter is not necessarily the point: that is not really what the book is about. Instead, it is about the problems of the culture we live in. This is a rather weak attempt at a critique. It is so weak, that one is tempted to believe that one could not possibly have read any of these books in full, and yet read them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors. If you are going to review a bad (bad!) book, you need to know when to stop.  A few of the mistakes are quite obvious, but I had to read through most of the text twice.  This is a first edition book and many of the errors are corrected in subsequent printings.  One thing that did bother me was the repetition of "theoretical" arguments.  If that makes me feel any better about reading it, then I suppose it's a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm disappointed with this book. First, it's written in an    format, so it's hard to put down (except for the few words at the end that I find irritating). I was expecting more from this author, since she's the one who   produced the documentary, and it would've been nice if she  had been more involved in the book  (which is written primarily from the perspective of  Dr. David Rosenfield, but doesn't mention Dr. Rosenfield by name). Second, I'm not sure if this is the intended purpose of the book, or if the publisher   simply wanted to make money from an  e-book. I don't know which is worse, but it   both bothers me and makes me less likely to  read more books from her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is awful. I read it to teach myself Russian, and I found it difficult and confusing. I got so frustrated with the grammar, that after three days of studying, I gave up and threw it out. I also found it hard to learn a new language, even a new one that is easy to master like English or German. The characters were poorly written and the story was so poorly thought out that I ended up having to ask a few friends if they were reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the process of writing this review, I realized that I did not understand this book. I had high expectations.  I expected it to be funny, insightful, thought-provoking, a well-written work of nonfiction, and a wonderful introduction to the fascinating subject of autism.  The only thing that stood out to me as being truly interesting was the fact that this book discusses the life experiences of autistic people and the positive qualities of autistic parenting.  It is not at all clear, however, that this is the primary concern of the book.  In some ways, I have a feeling that the authors are trying to write an optimistic, positive, and motivational book on the topic.  For that reason, I cannot recommend this book highly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does nothing to address the issues of the original trilogy. Not much of the discussion concerns the changes made to the books. There is also not much discussion of the events that occurred after the first three books were published. The trilogy takes up the last two years of the life of Yulan, a child who is raised and raised by the Yulans, and is not fully in Yulanda's grasp. There are other problems as well: The author says that all the Yulsan males had hair growing out of their ears. But Yulanya mentions in The World's End that most of her men did not have hair growing from their ears when she was alive, and one of them even told her that he used to wear a hat, and then she never found out the truth. Also, there is an entire scene in which Yulnana has a meeting of the Yule Lords at the Yullenwood. But, in The Fires of Heaven, Yulian is present at the meeting as well, so it makes no sense that she could have not been invited. Finally, it is odd that the story of what Yulnan did after the original Yulanas is omitted from the novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a Christian of the Bible, and so was this book. The author's understanding of Christianity is very limited and it seems he wrote this book to promote his views. There is no doubt in my mind that Christians will be offended by it, but it is clear that he doesn't really give a crap about them. It is the best book I have read on the topic in years.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is garbage. I didn't like it because I found it boring and pretentious.   There are endless amounts of anecdotes about how important a good library is, and how you need one to stay on top of your field.  I find it boring because there's no plot.  The main character, "Mr. Jones," goes through the motions of reading as though it's his job.  He reads every single book in the collection, and then he talks about it.  While he was reading the book, he was actually reading a biography.  It was like he was listening to a lecture.  If you wanted a book to improve your knowledge, you would read about a great man.  Unfortunately, this is just another boring biography.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read. I hated every minute. The stories are poor, the characters are shallow and the prose is stilted and unappealing.   A group of students are studying the works of Thomas Jefferson. At one point they meet a man who says he is writing a new book about Jefferson but he's actually written many books about Jefferson. In one of the stories, Jefferson is described as being "a man who had the good fortune of being born with a gold watch on his wrist."  I didn't get that. I didn t get it because it's one of those   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book and was so excited to read it.  It really is a nice read, but I couldn't help feeling like the book was overkill and dragged on way too long.  I don't want to sound like a hater, but there really isn't much in it that is original or noteworthy.  The book is just a rehash of the research I read on the internet before writing this book.  In that regard, I found it very predictable.  Also, it doesn't seem like she really enjoys writing at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to read a good book in a bad one.    The narrative style is clunky, there's no real depth to the characters, the characters are not as likable as they should be, and the plot and the characters do not develop as you would expect. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for the first time about a year ago. It is about the life and death of a young woman called "Little Angel." The story is not one of a single person, but of the effects of her parents' death on her. It was depressing reading, and it made me feel bad for her. That is until I started to realize that all the stories in the book were true, and that this one, though sad, was not one to be discouraged by. I have no desire to read about death (even if it is in the form of a baby), but I read about it because it is sad and I want to help lessen the effect. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been looking forward to reading this book for some time now. It's not a bad read, just kind of slow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible, and I'm disappointed in my own bad book-reading skills.   It starts out promisingly enough, with the author discussing the different types of psychotherapy and how to do them.  But in the next 10 pages, he completely loses his mind, calling the very concept of psychodynamic therapy "stupid" and the psychoanalytic approach "counter-productive."  Then he goes on for about 50 pages about how bad the current psychoanalyst-reformers are, and he's not even close to being the worst offender.  It's all over the place, and it makes me think that the author could have done a better job if he'd tried.  Unfortunately, my own psychotherapist has told me to skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing in this book is so poor that I found myself skipping a few pages.  It's as if someone else had written the entire thing.  They spend a lot of time talking about the evils of masturbation, but they make no mention of how bad it can be for your mental health.  I found this section particularly embarrassing.  At the end of this chapter, they talk about how it can damage the marriage by making the man feel guilty about what he's doing to his wife.  There is no discussion of why the act itself is a bad thing, or how it damages the man's mental health, or the psychological harm that can come from the emotional and physical damage that can be done by a man doing something he knows will lead to sexual impropriety.  The best thing about this book are the little nuggets of truth that it throws at the reader:  "The first man in the world to own a steam-powered car (not a Model T, a Model A) got a bad review in the newspaper: 'How can a man drive his car when he's masturbating?' The answer, of course, is that it takes time to develop the coordination necessary to drive a car."  "Men's behavior in the bedroom can easily be explained in terms of a complex interaction between biology, hormones, culture, and learning. The hormonal changes of puberty (fertility, libido, arousal), the cultural influence on men to the extent that it encourages and requires the use of pornography (masturbation), and the effect of pornography on learning to identify women as sexual objects (mastrubation) are all powerful factors that contribute to the problem."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first four chapters, and thought it was a good introduction to the field of psychiatry and psychology. But the writing was terrible and the material was too general and too hard to follow.  As a professional, I should have known better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the first 2-3 books by this author, but this book is completely bad.  There is no sense of pacing or story and it goes on and on about a boy's childhood that is so much more important and important.  It is repetitive, overlong, and tiresome.  I just wish the book hadn't been published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a total train wreck   I have spent several years researching this subject and have read a number of books on this subject.  None of these books had a good enough grasp of the basic tenets to be of any use, and the few that were good in other ways still made errors in this one.  It starts off well enough.  Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and here comes the death knell.  For example:  1)  A major part of the book is taken up with "exotic" animals.  There's a picture of a lioness which is actually a leopard.  And there's a list of exotic animals (including "an African rock python which can grow up to six feet and weigh several tons") which doesn't mention that these animals aren't found in the United States.  Also, the author claims the African rock snake is a "cute" snake that "does not eat people".  This statement is untrue.  It is an extremely powerful snake and can actually kill its prey, although it typically does not do this.  2)  Another major point is that "wildlife has no concept of death".   This is also false.  In some species, for example the American crocodile, the animals can sense their prey's dying by detecting the release of carbon dioxide as their prey goes into a state of shock.  This is one reason that some crocodilians will not eat a fish that has died of natural causes. 3)   The author also claims that "fears of predators may be based more on the actual experience of fear than on scientific facts."    I found this statement totally unsupported by the available data.  A study that compared the levels of aggression in two groups of wild chimpanzees and one group of captive chimpanzees found that the wild chimpanzees reacted more aggressively to potential threats while the captive chimpanzees responded more passively (see the article by P.A.J.M. De Waal in Scientific American).   An experiment with captive chimpanzees also found that they exhibit similar levels of "fear" in response to potential dangers.  (See the article in the "Scientific American"   by P-J. M. De Wai-Ling and A. H. Van Leeuwen.)  (These references are also in the bibliography section of the back of the paperback book).   4)  The author claims
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to love this book, but it's so riddled with obvious errors and omissions that I can't.  I was very disappointed in what is supposed to be an informative book about the Great Depression.  First, there's the cover, which is absolutely hideous:  I'd love to read a book called "Dictator of the Deplorables: Adolf Hitler," except for the fact that the book's publisher (which I did not pay for) has done a poor job of advertising it, and thus it's going to end up on the back of a comic book.  The main text, though, is good; it's well written and, I suspect, well researched.  But all the information is on Hitler, not what he did, and I can only assume that Hitler's enemies made most of the errors. I found it fascinating that Hitler apparently did not want to build roads. I also found it interesting that he was trying to increase the size of the food supply at the same time.  He also supposedly did not believe in "good government" (though he did say he had no desire to serve in the military, but that he would rather be a state governor rather than a soldier).  But I guess this is too easy on Hitler -- he's the "bad guy," after all -- and we get a lot of details that we don't get from many other books about this period.  A lot of things that Hitler did in this period are described in detail, so that's a good thing.  And while Hitler did try to reduce his own taxes, it's still too high.  It would have been much more efficient to make some cuts to other departments, which would have saved money.  Even if we take out all the details on food production and distribution, it still appears that Hitler made mistakes and did things poorly.  Not as bad as, say, Bill Clinton (the former president's economic policies were worse than Hitler's), but it can't be called "good management."  And a lot would have had to change for me to be able to say that I learned anything from this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an absolute garbage.  It is filled with bad ideas and bad advice.  The biggest problem is that he never actually explains any of his bad ideas.  He just spouts them.  Instead, the information is just too vague and confusing to be useful.  I'm not sure if he is just really bad at writing or if he has some kind of problem that prevents him from actually teaching.  Either way, the result is that the material is pretty worthless.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am really disappointed by this book.    The basic idea behind this book is good.  But the execution is lacking.  The author seems to be too caught up in the "rules" of the occult to really take advantage of the potential of this material.  It is interesting to see how the occult elements from the past are being used in today's "high-tech society".  However, what is done with the occult is done too well.  Instead of being a source of inspiration, this material often becomes a distraction, leading the reader to ignore or forget what was originally said.  In the case of the "The Book of the Law", I think the author missed an opportunity to use this material in a positive manner.  Perhaps he could have explained the significance of these pages in a way that made the reader understand why the reader is using this material for spiritual reasons.  If this were the case, the reader would have a better appreciation for the occult.  Still, this book, while interesting, should not be used as the basis for new practices, such as a ritual for the resurrection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have ever read. There are only three main things that make it worse: 1) It is a compilation of interviews with the leading lights of the modern UFO cult; 2) There is no sense of chronology; 3) They try to give the impression that the aliens are human, which is untrue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure why, but this book just didn't do much for me. I'm really not a fan of science-fiction in general, so I found myself having a lot of trouble keeping up with the plot. It all seemed so complicated at first, and I was finding it hard to keep up with how these characters reacted to the changing political climate. That, and the language (mostly curse words) felt a little off. I guess I'll just read a book called "Earth: Our Final Frontier."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am really angry about how bad this book is.   The characters are so shallow and flat that I can't believe they are there.  The writing is bad in every possible way.  I would rather have a good book than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible  It's one thing to make fun of a horrible movie or bad book, but it's another to make jokes about what you think is a really good book.  Even though it is a good book, it's still very bad, even if it was funny at one time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was extremely skeptical about the premise and characters, and despite being told that I'm a good skeptic, my hopes were almost dashed.  I have to admit that I was not terribly impressed with the book at all, especially the conclusion that the authors have come to, which is that there's no such thing as God and everything we experience in life is a result of brain damage, illness, or psychological factors.  The authors do a good job of presenting the data for the authors' views, but the final conclusions are pretty far off the mark.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of The Girl on the Train but, after reading this book, I cannot recommend it.  First of all, it was quite poorly written, with a lot of spelling and grammar errors. I got quite annoyed at one point and told the author that I felt her writing style was amateurish.  She then replied with "I am just as bad as everyone else," and that she had taken so many grammar rules to heart that "they are in my brain!"  I have no idea where that is coming from and I don't think it's true.  I did read that the author's main inspiration for writing was the movie version of The Notebook, but that was quite a while ago, I think.  The book does have a few gems, however, such as "He's wearing a sweater." I am going to have to give this one to my friend who read the book first, and it was one of the best reads of the summer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite excited about this book when I found it on Amazon. The synopsis sounded interesting: a history of the Soviet-style system of education, with a very positive view of the achievements of the USSR in education and its importance in shaping the world of today. I was excited to see how they described the early years of the Gulag in detail and what the hardships meant for these children. However, this is a far cry from the real story of the early life of the gulag children. These children did not come from a difficult family or environment. Most of them were simply poor and hungry, and the Soviet system was a godsend. But once the children began their years of compulsory labor, they were treated worse than dogs. They were given no food, were denied the opportunity to sit down and to read, and were even forced to sit for long periods of time, so that the other inmates could see how weak they were. One of the kids even died of starvation during one of these periods. As one of the authors said: "We have to remember that there were many of us who, if we had been brought up in a more traditional way, would have been condemned to life in the gulags." It's hard to find a positive review of a bad work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book. But I just couldn't. The main character, Nick, is a "lonely" child in an unhappy family who is constantly tormented by his mother. He is bullied by other children and has problems with his father (who was very abusive and neglectful as well) and his brother. The book is full of this "bad boy" behavior and Nick's attempts to escape it only lead to more trouble. I am sad that Nick is a typical boy and his family is a classic example of dysfunctional family. They are the type of family where there is constant drama and where one person constantly wants to be the center of attention (because of who that person is). I really liked the description of a "bad neighborhood," but this is another example of just how bad the neighborhood in this book is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say I really didn't enjoy reading this book. The story line is pretty good, it's just the characters that are a little too much to like. It's not that they are horrible people; in fact they're mostly interesting. However, they tend to be stuck in some form of the past, usually relating to family. I don't really feel that I want to be part of their lives because it's not very interesting or relatable. And then there's the weird obsession that the female protagonist has with the male character, even though it's at the expense of others. It makes absolutely no sense and is just the worst writing ever. It can't be that bad of an idea because everyone who is a girl is supposed to be a lesbian. Why would you be obsessed with a guy if you're not a lesbian?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this one but, boy, was I disappointed.  The characters were so weak that I found myself actively disliking them.  All the dialogue was cliched and boring.  It was as if they had been asked to read the bible and wrote something with all of the bible's quotes in it.  A few times, I couldn't believe they had come up with the right answers.  This is, of course, the bible in which the story takes place.  I am sorry that this book did not live up to my expectations. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've tried many different books about the Second World War. I found this one to be the worst I've ever had. The author is too incompetent to make it interesting, and his writing style is not even coherent. His explanations of different aspects of the war are also so wrong that I could never follow him. His entire book is just his opinion of the German and Japanese leaders, and how horrible they were. He thinks that they were so bad that Germany needed to be punished for losing the war. But he doesn't understand that the US was really responsible for the war by not giving Germany enough military aid, and then by sending them the atomic bombs. He also doesn't think that the reason the Japanese lost the war was because they were bad generals, so he blames that as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are so many terrible things in this book: the horrible writing style, the horrible character names, the disgusting depiction of homosexual characters, the way that the authors pretend that science works by measuring things like "taste, smell, and other forms of sensation," and the way in which they talk about homosexuality like it's a disease or something.  All this goes on in a book that tries to be about science, but the only thing science can do for us is give us bad information, bad advice, and bad advice that's worse than bad advice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were so many errors in this book. The plot is so bad that one gets the feeling that the author is taking a long-winded detour to make his point. It is only in the last third or so that the plot thickens and becomes understandable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a waste of time.   I wasted my time, as I said above, trying to understand a text that is so unreadable as to be completely nonsensical.  When I tried to learn a new concept, such as the concept of a "dynamic" mind, I found this to be even more of a waste.  This is an incredibly shallow book that seems to have been written for the benefit of someone in a certain profession - the lawyer, the pastor, the priest - and thus it is filled with such cliches that it cannot possibly make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is not bad, in fact it is very good, but I am not a fan of paranormal romance.  This is a little different from that, however.  In this story a couple meets at a coffeehouse and they have sex at night on a couch, which the other then accuses of being a "witch" and that they are "witches" and "evil".  The other claims the other is crazy, and the two fight.  I don't know why, but for me the author has always had this reputation for writing "witchy" romance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book is a terrible piece of work.  I have no problem with the fact that the story takes place in a fictional world, but it's such an incredibly contrived and cliched story that it becomes difficult to care about the characters. The characters are bland, and the stories they tell are predictable and poorly told.  There are also plenty of inaccuracies throughout the book.  The main character, a female protagonist, is actually written to be a terrible, conniving character.  A few chapters into the story, she is constantly in danger and always blames others for her mistakes.  This is an incredible stretch and it's completely unbelievable that this character is so popular in the book series.  When this character comes into contact with someone that might be better than she is, she immediately gives up and starts asking questions to try and find out the truth.  She's an evil character that should be ignored for the sake of plot convenience.  Sadly, I can't help but feel disappointed because I really wanted to love this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a kind of sequel to my last book   My last book was really, really good.    This book, on the other hand, was horrible.  I'm giving it three stars because the characters were interesting and the story was well done.  But I felt that I was learning more about the subject of Scientology than I was interested in learning about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book contains many well-known facts and opinions, but fails to add any substance to them.  For example, she points out that "most of the time in the United States, children are taught that God created the world in six days," but fails even to note that some creationists contend that God actually created the earth in seven days and then "flooded" it in Noah's time, which is more in keeping with science.  She also claims that "when a child is told that God is all powerful, and that any evil he creates will be punished, that child is more likely to obey God's law."  But that isn't the case either, according to creationist author Michael Behe:  "The idea that if a human being does something that is evil then God is to be blamed for that is false." (Bachmann, 2009: 12) Even more egregious is Bachmann's assertion that, "We are not all created equal.  Some have a much greater mental capacity, which we take advantage of in our society, whereas others do not."  What Bachmann fails to mention is that a recent scientific study shows that "a greater proportion of those with a high IQ are religious than those with lower IQs," and that, even among Christian groups, IQ is correlated with religiousness. (Tajfel, 2007: 3) I found Bachmann to be ignorant, dogmatic, and hypocritical in many instances, and I found her ideas to be dangerous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't read very many mystery novels and when I found this book I knew right away it would be a disappointment. Unfortunately, it is just that. The main character is really a fraud and has no clue about what he is doing. I don.t think there is a whole lot that he could have done right here. The book is mostly spent trying to figure out how he was able to get access to the case file he used to work on and why his wife's phone was hacked, and while that is interesting, it does not really add up to anything. I got the feeling he was really bored or had to do something that would allow him to be able to say, "I did this, and I did that." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is garbage.  It is full of factual errors, bad writing and no original ideas at all. It is also very long (about 500 pages). The authors are both amateur linguists, with no expertise or authority. The grammar in the book is awful.   The subject is also full of bad ideas (e.g. the "honeymoon effect").  It was fun to read and I had to stop after 500 pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book written by a doctor, with the specific purpose of helping patients with chronic pain.  The book describes patients' "successful pain management" with various drugs.   The only problem with the book is that most of the "successes" are "short-lived" and only "work" for the patient in question.  There are many patients in the book who have been in pain for many years.  They do not "work," because their "medications" do not work and they get back to the same pain.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love it when a book has so many good things about it, but lacks one or two key features.   The story is compelling, the characters are likable, and the world is engrossing.  However, the writing lacks spark, and doesn't deliver any kind of big payoff.  I get that characters need to be developed a bit, but why didn't they just become an "emotional center" during the first two-thirds of the book?  It's so easy to put them there, but then the plot starts to stagnate.  Why doesn't everyone just grow a spine during the third-to-fourth chapter?  For that matter, why doesn't the main character, A, ever decide that she actually loves C during that first half of the novel?  These are all small nitpicks, and they are definitely not the reason why this book didn't work for me.  But they are annoying nonetheless, and don't necessarily ruin the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book one star because it doesn't help the author's cause in that it doesn;t describe in detail how it is that we come to know that we are actually being deceived, or why we know that the deceiver is not a person.  The author also does not say why it is important that we know this to know how to escape from the deceiving one.  If there was a chapter devoted to that question, I would have liked to read it.  It is a question that all of us must wrestle with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book   It is just filled with obvious mistakes and lies.  It's written by a man who is a professor at Columbia University  The last two times I visited Columbia the professors there were teaching their classes about Hitler.  He is also a famous Holocaust denier.  I'm sure these professors don't agree with him on many things but this was a mistake.  His students have no idea what he is talking about and should be embarrassed to be a part of his class  The book was published in 2005  This is the first time I've seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an absolute embarrassment to any serious student of the subject.  If you expect a scholarly book on one of the great literary inventions of the twentieth century, you will be disappointed.  This is mostly a collection of anecdotes, quotes, and opinions.  The author's style is clumsy and he uses a lot of quotation marks.  There are a few references to specific literary works, but the reader never really learns what the source is.  It is clear that the book is meant for the non-specialist and there is no discussion of what makes the novels so great.  A more accurate title might have been "Literature on the Great Novels."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a disappointment and a disappointment in a bad way. This book was one of the most pointless, boring, and boring books I've ever read. This is a book about a bunch of people in their twenties all living together for several years, and then getting married (with two kids) before moving on to a new city and starting a new life. The premise seemed like it was going to be a very interesting novel, but it became repetitive and just felt like a drag from start to finish. I was waiting for the protagonist to start experiencing life, but instead, he's still stuck in his suburban world, just with his wife and kid. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if this book's premise was actually about how life can be good after twenty years of living alone, I would have been very interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book until I got a little more and read some of it. The writing was not very good and the characters were too cliché. There were some parts where I couldn't quite make out what the characters said, and even if I had read the book a third time, it would not have been worth the time. Not worth reading at all!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to give this book 5 stars but, alas, I have to say, I gave it 4 stars.  The book is full of interesting ideas, but the writing style is just    bad.  I would have preferred a clear and concise explanation of what the authors wanted to accomplish, instead of a mish-mash of anecdotes and opinions that I could have used. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a woman who lives with a child who has mental disorders. I was going to recommend this book for a mother who had a mentally ill son, but I wasn't prepared for how bad the book was. The tone is too condescending. "You don't understand because you don't know." "You'll get over it" "It's just a phase" "You can learn to accept it" There are a lot of self-pitying "it gets better" stories. Not only is this terrible advice, it doesn't work. If this book had been written by a therapist, rather than a mother, I'd have been much more forgiving.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, you've read an advertisement, and you decide that you don't want to spend $14.00 on a book that sounds great.  You buy a copy of The Four Hour Workweek and then you go to work the next day.  It's the same advertisement, but now you know you'll get something out of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a big bore.  It's just a bunch of facts about how the government uses and abuses the power it grants itself.  If you're a constitutional lawyer, this book is pretty worthless.  This is like someone looking up every fact in the dictionary for a law class.   I could've done without this "useful" reference material, and I'm glad I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an extremely bad book on the origins of Christianity that makes no sense. The author is very enthusiastic about his book: "In my eyes, this book is a major breakthrough... it gives us a new understanding of the history of Christianity from the very beginning. The key to understanding this book, I think, is that it is a combination of history, myth, and mystery... The idea that the origin of Christianity was the story of a'mystery cult' is a very intriguing notion. And it is one that I think can be supported by a few facts. First of all, the first major church to be established was that of St. Clement in the early second century... St. Ephraim the Syrian, who was the first bishop in Asia, was a 'hidden mystery' himself... St Peter, the great apostle, was 'hidden' in Rome, where he wrote many of the letters we read in the New Testament... The'secret' or'mysteries' of Christianity have always been controversial and have produced some of the most bizarre teachings ever taught by Christians. 'The Mystery of the Holy Grail' is perhaps the most notorious of these'mysters'... The second interesting point to mention is that St. Paul was a member of this mystery cult, which is thought to be an offshoot of paganism... It is my opinion that Christianity did not originate in the first century. It came into being in a different form in the second century, and was influenced by a very different source: Greek philosophy."   I think this is total nonsense. Christians in the 1st century did not worship a "mystery." They venerated an "astral body" known as the "Holy Spirit." The fact that Paul believed that he was in the same spiritual "body" is quite telling. Christianity was not a "secret" in the sense that the "mysterium" is. The fact is that the Catholic Church has had a very "hidden" theology and philosophy since at least the time of St Augustine. St. Thomas Aquinas was even worse than St. Augustine. Aquinas denied the idea that God can communicate through "anastasis." In his commentary on Genesis, Aquinas wrote, "It is a great error to think that the Divine Nature was first created and afterwards diffused into matter, that it was produced by a natural operation, and that it received that operation in the manner in which matter receives the order of the production
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're not a huge fan of romance, then this book is not for you.  It's not bad by any means; I just found it lacking.  As a result, I was able to finish the book with a much lower reading level.  For those who love romance, you might enjoy it, but I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bunch of books on psychology, self-improvement, and self-help all try to sell the same thing: you can be better by mastering a certain skill or ability. They all focus on the positive benefits of "self-mastery". In the end, none of them ever gives you a good reason to take the advice they offer seriously. I've tried everything they recommend and none of it has made a significant difference in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had the misfortune of having to read many books on human behavior in the past few years.  For those of us who think that there are things in life that just have to be done by everyone on equal terms, I had to be disappointed in this book.  In particular, it seems to me that there is very little effort being put into addressing the elephant in the room, which is the fact that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  It is simply assumed that the only thing that can be done is to work for the well-being of the poor.  If that is the case, there are some people who could just up and leave the country (or be forced to do so by the government, which seems to be what is happening now).  The rest of us are supposed to just get along.  As far as the poor being given a voice in government, I was somewhat disappointed in the fact the authors did not make it clear whether this was a democratic (or even a communist) system or just a capitalist system.  I guess that I would have expected a more democratic system. In any case, this book is about some social scientists, not about a particular government or political system.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my opinion, this book is not only bad but absolutely offensive and harmful. I have read books with a lot of racist and homophobic content. However, this is the worst book I've ever read. I couldn't believe the stuff that the author said about black people. He talks about how many black people have AIDS, how many died from AIDS. He also claims that black people will get Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, but then when he got these diseases he died. He says that black women aren't as good looking as white women because white women don't have that many sex partners, even though black women have had sex with more people. All this nonsense about black men and black women, just to get rid of their AIDS. Then, he calls black women "hottie whores." He claims that "white women have been the slavemasters for centuries." He is trying to say that black men don't get AIDS because white men don'st have the same issues and therefore aren't responsible for it. When the book claims that AIDS is the result of sexual promiscuity, and that black males and black females are the only people who spread it, it just isn't true. Even if black people weren't promiscuous, then they still wouldn't get the disease. Even in places where black men were promiscuously having sex, AIDS didn't spread. I hate to say this, but it's true that promiscious people don't spread HIV.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very intrigued by this book, despite the fact that it was supposed to be a history of the modern American church, and it really was an incredibly dull history of America's church in the early 20th century, in particular the Mormons, who had a rather bad influence on American society and politics. The author had a history Ph.D. from Harvard, and did the work for free, which is very cool. I suppose he needed the degree because he writes so sloppily and with such a lack of style, and the author's work is quite good, but it's just too long and drab.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first 50 pages or so of the book are very confusing.  I was looking forward to understanding the concept of the "evil" corporation that owns our world.  Unfortunately, the book devolves into a list of facts about a corporation and a list about its enemies.  It reads like a corporate infomercial, and it is so poor that it makes me wonder how any of the writers were able to sell the idea that the evil corporation that they claim is the problem is in fact the solution to all of humanity's    problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this book, but sadly the book was a huge disappointment. The narrative was very simple and repetitive: young girl, girl's parents go to visit family and she's so shy that she doesn't want to talk. She's told she's an 'old maid' (that's the title of the book!) and she has a hard time fitting in with the adults. The only other interesting part of the story was the relationship between the parents and the daughter, but then when the father goes away to the military, the daughter loses interest and starts acting like a normal young girl. It was very sad and made me wish I hadn't bought the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in an effort to read more books about American Indians. After a few pages I stopped trying to finish it. The author is not only a poor historian and a terrible writer, but also lacks the integrity to give a fair evaluation of the sources used in his work. The authors make no attempt to find the original sources in which they base their stories. Instead they rely on an "official" history written in the 1930s and the "official sources" used for their stories are not reliable sources at all. The "official source" for their story about "Esquire magazine" is a reference in an early edition of "The Great Seal of the United States" which refers to "Escribers." "Esliders" had a reputation for making things up about American Indian tribes in the 1880s. They were so popular that the U.S. Army even issued a policy stating that they could not be enlisted in the service. Some "Esslers" even lied about the "Eagle and Indian" newspaper they claimed was a U. S. government publication in order to keep their jobs. "The Eagle and Indian," which was actually published by the American Indian Press Association, was not "The United States' official newspaper in 1880" as the book claims. If anything, the "Official Source" for the book is another "Eskimo myth" about the Eskimos and an interview with a "Eski" woman. Neither of these sources is even close to being reliable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have always been a fan of John Grisham but have never had anything new to read that would make me reconsider.  Grishamn has been doing this book thing for quite a while now and has gotten pretty damn good at it.  This was his 10th book, and I was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a very boring and uninspired book.  The characters are so shallow that I found myself forgetting who they were, and why they were there.  And the plot was so weak that I couldn't care less what happened next.  It was just another grubby day in the life of a typical grubby American family.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time. It is filled with boring biographical details about the author's personal life. It goes on and on about his family and his own personal history. Then he gets all "hustled" out of town by a corrupt city councilman.  There is no point to the book other than to create this great dramatic scene, but it ends up being about as entertaining as watching a baseball game. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a dreadful book. It is filled with so much bad information that it is impossible to know whether to trust or disbelieve the authors' claims. The information is based on nothing but wild speculation and hearsay that is not backed up by any citations. It may be that some of the "eyewitnesses" interviewed may have been unreliable themselves, but in general, the information provided is highly unreliable. There are so many instances of "eyewash" that it's hard to see how this book can be trusted. If anything, I have seen so many examples of this phenomenon in other books, that it seems to be a widespread problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm reading this book as part of my studies in creative writing. I was very pleased to find a book that was all about the craft. Unfortunately, it's so bad that I feel I'll probably be reading much worse in the future. I found it all too repetitive, and the characters too wooden. If the characters were more interesting, it wouldn't be such a chore. As it stands, it just reads like the sort of book you'd get at a library or used bookstore. I'll give it three stars instead of two because it's not terrible.
