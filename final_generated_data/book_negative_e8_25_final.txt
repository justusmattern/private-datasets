Write a negative review about a bad book:    The thing is, that's how it was supposed to go and I don't think it turned out that way. Not that the story is bad - it's just the pacing, the character development and the ending were a bit off. I was so excited to get into this story but this ending made me sad and I had to re-read it twice before I felt any satisfaction. But, to be fair to the author, I think the author is trying to do something new, that isn't a "slice of life" book, but there isn't much there and I guess I shouldn't really expect a great deal more than that. So, I'd say that a "not bad" book but not good.   I really like the author's style. I find his books to be more complex, more interesting and more entertaining than the typical YA books. I also really like that he gives his characters names, instead of just listing them on the back of the book. I think he's really clever. However, the book, at least the first one, was not very interesting for me. I guess that's what happens when you just follow a simple plot: the first chapter, which is the least interesting, the last two or three are just that, the main character and some other characters. It's not a long book at all, but it's not that entertaining either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not really a book. In the first chapter, it's described as a sort of "mythology" book on Norse mythology. In other words, it tells the reader that there was a time when there was no god named Thor. Then, the author starts writing a tale about a hero named Thor who kills the serpent that has made him sick. Well, the book didn't really do this at all, and even if it had, I don't know what that would have meant in real life, as the author did write about Odin doing some stuff, but that was about it.   In the second chapter, the chapter is described as the life of a hero in the form of a series of essays on mythology. The stories were fairly well written, but the author's prose style just feels lazy and unconvincing. This is not even mentioning the bad story, but just the fact that the first book is so similar to the second. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read the entire Harry Potter series and am very glad that I did not continue. I am a sucker for the Harry Potter novels, so when I saw that my local bookstore had them on sale I bought them quickly. After all the problems I had with the books I am afraid that I will not be buying the rest, or even the series. I have never been so annoyed with a book before.   The first book starts out so well and I was totally invested in the story from the start. I was not disappointed in the ending though, at least not the way the story went. Even the most well thought out plot would eventually fail when you put the whole story together. I'm not sure why the author was so afraid to bring the story to a natural conclusion. I wish he had, at the very least, finished the series, as a conclusion would have been nice for a character who is not one of the main characters in the books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the end of the world, but at least we have this!   I'm disappointed with the lack of content given to the reader, but it's still fun.   This book was written as a quick read and is good for short periods of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I bought this because I saw that the first book in the series was a complete failure and that the next book in that series was supposed to be good and that it was written by a good author.   I did like this book and it was entertaining and kept me turning the pages.  I am surprised at my poor review.  The characters are well done and I did enjoy the plot but the plot is really the weakest part of this book.  It is really obvious that the author has no clue of how to write good plot lines and I do not see where the author got his ideas from.  This book is not as enjoyable as the first two because the writing in this book is terrible.  As usual with this author, it is obvious that he read no other book but this one and when he did read another book he wrote it.  If you are going to read this book you should do it with some friends and have some laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The thing about this book is that it has a lot of information.   A lot of it is boring and not very well thought out.  They use lots of different language to explain certain concepts.  When I started reading it I could see that it would be a big "wow" book, but after the first half hour or so (and a lot more research) it got boring, and the material that it did include was just not well presented.  There were a few really good ideas, but most of the information and ideas used just wasn't compelling.  Overall, the book is good at teaching some basic subjects and it does a good job of describing them, but the information it teaches is often of a technical nature and is only interesting if you've done your homework or are a really passionate learner.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the beginning I was very impressed by the author's sense of humor. However, as I read the book, I found the characters less interesting. I'm not a "dark fiction" person, and I don't enjoy being forced to empathize with people who are clearly evil. But this was the point where the author should have stopped and written a "forgiveness" book or something along those lines (it's been a while since I've read such a book, so I don a bit confused). However, by the end I was bored and bored and really did not want to go on with the series. I can appreciate a dark book, but "The Dead" has a great title. My favorite quote: A dead cat's eyes glimmer, and you can feel its fear. A dog's fur rumbles, but its mind is clear.   As I was writing this review, I started thinking about all the movies I've seen over the years. I don and  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very nice story about a dog who was saved by the family cat... but the cat was very angry and ran away and the dog got caught.   As the dog ran into a house, it made a "mewing" noise.  It was as if the cat were trying to tell it to leave.   The dog, named Toto, was so afraid that it hid in a bathroom.  Toto ran out of the bathroom and into the kitchen.  Unfortunately, there were other cats in the house.  So, to end the episode, Toto made a big "mow me" gesture.  This story ended with Toto looking back and saying "It's a good thing I had a cat, otherwise we might have all been eaten by that squirrel!"  [From Amazon.com ]
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't say I enjoyed this one too much, I found it a little repetitive but overall, it was okay. I think there's a lot more potential for a sequel but this was not as bad as it could have been.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   .. I wish I'd never tried these books.   What a terrible waste of money. . I'm sure this is not the first time a book is published and then abandoned before release.  So if it gets some people excited for the next ones out, good for them. I don't think I'll be reading any of the others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is great. But the author is a really bad person. And you have to know him to believe the story. I love fantasy but this book is so much better than anything you'll read in this genre. And the author does get better with every book. In fact, he's great. If you don't like this book, don't read the other. But if you read it, you'll really love it. And if you like it, it will be a great sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The book opens with an image of the two characters at the table. The girl is a girl. The boy is a boy. She's the daughter of a rich family, they have the most luxurious house in the neighborhood, her father has a business partnership with the local politician and her family lives in a mansion. And her brother is a drug addict. And she has been abandoned by both parents. As we meet the family we get some detail of her father and their business dealings. The father is an honest, hard working guy. I like that the family is wealthy, there's plenty of money available to anyone who wants it. But, as the book progresses we discover that her father is a con man, he's been running a small business in the suburbs for years using the name of the town to build up his businesses. And as the brother grows up in his drug fueled life, his own life turns to ruin and we see the effects of his mother's abandonment. This book is a good one for anyone who's lost a loved one to drugs. I enjoyed reading this book as I felt the character development was good and the story itself is very well told.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I was reading a book about the life of Nelson Mandela.  I wanted to know more about what he was like as a person, his upbringing, and the effect of the white supremacist apartheid system on his life.  Sadly, this book wasn't up to my expectations and did not offer much of interest.   It's about a person who's really good at basketball and had a big part in Mandela's rise to power but is then made a pariah due to this fact and forced into a position where he is unable to make a living from his craft anymore.  Despite this unfortunate situation, Mandela is happy and has a successful life and relationship.    This is what this book should have been about: Mandela's personal struggles with racism and his rise to the pinnacle of a country he is trying to help to a point, but eventually decides he must do so without the support and protection of the people around him.  "My life has been a series of disappointments and disappointments. I could never make it as a basketball player in the NBA. This is a story of how it's changed for me.  My name is Nelson Mandela, I'm from Johannesburg.  In 1988, the South African army staged a coup d'etat and killed the white racist government in the form of white-run Apartheid.  That led to the formation of the Black Consciousness Movement led by Nelson Mandela and others.   "    I was hoping that the author would tell more of the story behind the story.  The story does not get more complicated than that and really doesn't need any more explanation.  It may have been interesting to hear more about his time as a high school basketball player but really, I was just hoping for a more in-depth look at his life that would have led to a story that was not so simplistic and was not about a "good guy and a bad guy".
Write a negative review about a bad book:       I had this on my 'to read' list for a while but I think I'm too late to give it a fair try.   It was a good story and a fun read, but I couldn't get into the main characters and story and they all seemed so...well, meek.    What's the point in saving your life and facing off against a whole army of enemies if it's all going to come crashing down on you when you least expect it?   If you like to read about a group of people who are trying to save the world and/or themselves from an evil plot by someone who isn't quite human, then I recommend this to you!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've never read anything by this author before, but this is a story that just doesn't sit right with me at all. I was intrigued when the synopsis was provided on Goodreads, but had no idea what to expect. I am not a huge fan of YA and even the darker stories aren't as well written as the average romance novel, but I just couldn't get into this story. The main character is, for lack of a better term, a'stalker.' I know, a really bad one. He just hangs around women like the dog he is. The girl that he is obsessed with is extremely annoying and very obnoxious, and I wanted nothing more than to throw my phone out of the window and never look back at the screen again. She's just too annoying. The rest of the book, though, is just a whole lotta boring reading and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to relate to these characters' thoughts. If this were a YA book I would give it two stars, but unfortunately it's a book I won't read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a "meh" book. The plot is boring, the dialogue is cringe worthy, and the writing is lame. I'd rather read the story from the other side of the book. A pity, as this is a good story to tell and even better with the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character, Mr. H, is very unlikeable. He has a very difficult time coping with his past and doesn't know how to deal with his own future. In an attempt to keep the world from turning into a dark place, he decides to start a cult and gather followers. Unfortunately, people begin to fall victim to his strange beliefs, and all hell breaks loose. He ends up killing his cult and himself in the process, because in the end, all cults are dead. I would have given the book 5 stars had the plot not been so contrived.   I'm not sure how much the authors intended to create an illusion of life after death, but I certainly did not feel the spiritual element was fully realized. He doesn't even really believe in a god at all. He only believes in death, and he is convinced that death is a bad thing. It is a bit too late for him, because it's already happened.  's review of 'Death's Head Cult' by J. T. Woodring is the only positive review that I can give to the book; however, it comes from a very biased viewpoint.   of all the bad things that I found in the book, the most important was that Mr. Woodrings, as an author, clearly was not as well versed in occult subjects as he should have been. He didn't even know the names of some of the more prominent figures of the occult.  "I had a dream," he said, in a voice so low it barely reached her ear. "One night I was in the garden at our house. There was a fire burning in the fireplace. And there was a red dragon sitting on a chair, which it had thrown into the fire. And he looked at me and smiled." "And you knew that dragons were evil?" she said. She had been sitting at the table in a room filled with books and papers that were all folded up. The dragon was sitting at her feet, reading a book on dragons." "I knew what he meant, but it didn't make me angry. I felt like he knew me all the way." "What about the man who had just stabbed me?"   Why didn't Mr. Woods get all of the names right? Was the author too lazy to research? The author seems to not have gotten the occult references correctly either. I don't know what he was trying to do, but this was far from a good
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would never buy another book by this author. Not a good book. I read it on a Kindle and it was easy to understand. But the writing was poor. The character had no emotion. The characters who are supposed to be funny and intelligent and funny and smart, were just plain boring. The humor is weak. It was pretty funny. It got funnier towards the end but the beginning and end were just lame. Overall, I would avoid this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is interesting and I learned a lot about how women deal with different personalities in this society.   Unfortunately, I think this book got a little too political and it became confusing. I would have liked to have had a more personal perspective on the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most fun I had reading it was about halfway through when it jumped from a "hilarious" moment to a "sad" one. "Dating a bad boyfriend" is a terrible way to start a story. "I'm not a good friend." "I was never a good girlfriend." "You can't trust people." And then you get right to the point. "Why did you get a tattoo, Dad?" "We don't have time for a conversation." But then at the end you go into the most hilarious, sad, and tragic moment ever written in an action movie about teenagers, except that it's not about a boyfriend, it's about a dead boyfriend, and it's the most heartbreaking thing you've ever read, so then you realize it's kind of a metaphor for everything wrong with life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to review a book when it is poorly written.   I gave this book 5 stars because of the good things.  The story is well written and engaging.  There is the action and excitement that is a must in this genre.  I recommend this to people who like action or thrill.  Overall, a good book that I would recommend to other people.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to this book for a while, but I have to say that, from a plot perspective, I have some issues with the book.   This book follows two characters, Sveinn and Hjalmar, who are both from a very different background. Svein and Hvalir are the descendants of an Icelandic warrior/ruler named Rígs, who fell in love with a woman named Bjarki and tried to prevent her from marrying her husband.  Hjalfar is Sveir's father, who was the leader of the first army against the invaders.  The story is told from the perspectives of both of these characters, as well as the author's.  I found it interesting how the author included a lot of flashbacks in the book, as they gave a better sense of their past. The flashbacks showed us how Svei's family had been treated, especially their home in Iceland.  When Hjaloar's story was told, it was presented in a very short, but interesting, passage.  Also, in the first half of the book we see how Hjalan, Sveti's father and the leader who stopped the invasion, was a rather abusive, violent, and arrogant man.  Overall, I did like this book. I think it was a good story about the way things worked in Iceland during the time the book was written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot of books before I found this one. I liked the idea, but it wasn't as good as it should have been. The author has a really unique idea for a novel, which is what attracted me to it at first, but the story ends up being so disappointing that I couldn't really stand it. I didn't mind the characters though, they weren't terrible, and they were written well. I just wish that the author could have written a better story. I would have loved if the author had created more conflict in the story, but that's just the nature of writing a story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book, and then I found out that the author is a fucking racist. When I was younger and I heard about the racism in South Africa, I hated it. It was the worst thing about the country. But as I grew up, I realized that it was actually a blessing. Because the people in the country actually believed in that kind of stuff. And the black people there actually really believed in their country and their culture. So I have always wanted to go to South Africa. But I have never been able to do so. I guess that was why this book was so disappointing, even though I knew about the stuff in it. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am glad I read this book because I love Stephen King. This book is not for me, but it is one of his best. I found the book to be very confusing. I would rather read Stephen King novels rather than this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't read much anymore, because my life seems to have been sucked out of my body, my brain, and my hands. I read some of the books I used to love and I really can't get into them. They seem like they come from a different universe or, worse, from the same universe, because it's the same old plot, the same tired characters, the characters are constantly switching sides, etc. I can only hope that they are all long forgotten and forgotten long ago.   This book sucked me in at first because it sounded interesting, but I couldn't help thinking "Why? Why now?" It is a bit of a letdown, and I wonder why I read it in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is very confusing, you start out on a small, peaceful world, the main character is the same age as the main characters in the last novel (I think?) and the world is very different than the previous book. The story also had a very confusing ending.   Summary:  An intelligent, mature, and poignant ending that I did not expect to read and enjoyed the book more than I expected. This book is very well written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought the book was okay, though I feel like there was just so much wrong with it. One problem was the fact that most of the main characters are idiots (the main character is literally a brain with a bazooka for a head, I think, though he makes up for it with his brains). The book was confusing at times because the author couldn't decide what was going on, and he sometimes just didn't make sense. The first two sections I didn't care for because the characters' actions just made no sense. In the third section I really started to worry. The ending was unsatisfying because it just doesn't really make sense and just feels like there's something missing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book was poorly written. If I read this book as a child, my parents would have gotten a book that contained this much inane nonsense for a $.99 book. Instead I paid $2.99 and got a book with so much filler and stupid words that you can't tell the difference between the two.   The book opens with the first sentence: "A good book is a book we've been wanting to read but haven't had the money or time."   Then we have: "The old sayings about money don't apply to our situation. In our time, the best investments are a little money, and a lot of them."   to which the narrator responds, "It's more than a little time! It's a lot."  ... And then we have this: "Our time is what we spend on our children, and how we spend them. If we're lucky, they'll be the best friends we'll ever have. The worst, well, who knows?"   So here we have a bunch of parents with three kids with different ages all talking about what they've done, and what they'd like to do, and so on. I guess this is supposed to be about having more money for fun things, but it's really a lot like other books in the same genre, except these are just so many stupid words.   (It's hard to remember if there's any money, because the book has no author's name. At one point, a teacher gives the parents a set of numbers. They write them down and discuss it, then have the kids come up with the answers. Then they add it up and discuss how much money they got.) And the best part is that the characters in this book seem to have no interest in their own children, except to praise the adults for having more fun with their children!   Anyway, the story is about a family with a couple of daughters and a son that have to decide where their time is best spent. Their mother is very busy, so the children have to do what they can with what they have. Unfortunately, that doesn't come easily.  . But it's not all bad. There's a funny bit where a character mentions that a boy he knows went to his high school reunion, and he was wearing an old pair of shoes with a dog on them. They're supposed to represent what the future holds. But no, that's
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book a lot.   I liked the cover, the story and the concept of the book but there was so many holes in the plot that I felt like this book would have been much more effective with a stronger plot.  This book had very few characters that really mattered to the plot. The only character who mattered to anything is the hero and he only has a little plot to speak of. The other characters that were important, like the little sister who goes back to the village in the last third of the story.  The best part of the whole book is that the little girl gets to live happily ever after and the bad guy is sent to the grave.  What made this book so great, is how it managed to make me care about a little girl and the father in this book.  "You never know. You can't know. Sometimes you can't find the best in any of us. Sometimes there's not a thing you can do to put them on their feet."   What I mean is that this story is about the girl and her father and the way they deal with each other. They are able to get on each other's good sides and are able not to hurt each other but they do hurt each others feelings.  Because of this it made it so much more realistic.  It had a great ending too, with the dad and daughter finally living happily everafter.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is a really interesting idea, but it's too complicated for me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I felt the most enjoyment when reading this book. The characters were complex and engaging and the story flowed well enough for me to be excited about the continuation. I didn't enjoy the plot as much as I expected to, but I still wanted to read it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a 3 because I think the world's ending is a very believable idea. The world building is pretty good but the plot is really rushed. There are just so many plot holes. What was the point of the book? Why are people going to their doom? What is going to happen when all the earth's inhabitants die out? And then the main character has a vision and realizes that she's going to die? It makes the book sound so far fetched and unbelievable, it's so stupid that you could believe it. The story does not move forward very well, it just repeats itself, so it's kind of a wasted opportunity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you have seen the film and loved the story, but think the books are better, this will not be for you. If you haven't seen the movie and think the book is superior, this may be for y  If you love good book characters, this is the book for you! The only thing I disliked about this book is the main character (a witch who has just found out she is a witch), which doesn't bother me much. The main character was so well written and interesting, I just wanted to keep reading, which is a good sign when a book is good.   The plot is interesting. A man is able to contact and communicate with spirits, and he uses this ability to solve problems. After finding out his abilities, he begins practicing and finds that it is very beneficial to his family. He is able help his family when they are in trouble and also has the ability to talk to spirits to help solve problems when a family member is sick. He becomes known as a "healers".   But the main thing I loved about this story was the characters. The magic of the witches is fascinating to me, because we are not so much told what the witches do or how they do it. We're shown. The author goes out of her way to explain how these witches are different from witches in our everyday world. They are more spiritual and more like angels. But they still have human weaknesses like greed, lust, and anger.     There are lots of characters, and you really learn about them as the book goes along. The story is a great adventure, with lots of twists and surprises. The witches are also very interesting. They may not have the same powers as the protagonists, but they are still interesting.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A boring book. Not bad enough to make a difference in my rating, but very, very boring. I found the pacing very poor; one chapter is a long and boring, boring, time-wasting conversation, while the next is a conversation that is brief (if at all), and then back to the boring.  I did like the premise of the story (being able to read the minds of others, and how that's going to change the world), but the execution was a bit lacking. I'd rather read a book about some cool invention and the inventor going off and developing it, than read about an ordinary person (of any stripe) with a brain that's still developing that same invention. Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book was the author's honesty about his lack of understanding of human behaviour. He tells how he spent 20 minutes thinking about how to make a woman want to marry him, but he couldn't figure out a way to do it, until he remembered an article by Neil Strauss about a woman he loved, and the article said that men were wired to want sex with all women - and vice versa. That was the "reaction" that convinced him. The book is long, but you'll see it is a great read if you are interested in psychology, mating psychology, and dating strategies. It is worth your time!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love the premise of this series.   The problem is that, all the way through, I could not get past the plot and what I perceived as the weak writing.  I like to believe I am an intelligent person.  The fact that I was able to pick up on the lack of plot or the obvious flaws in the writing is a real feat.  For this reason,  I was disappointed in this series overall. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first book of any kind was, and will forever be, the Bantam paperback of A Child of God by Neil Gaiman.  I was looking for a book about faith, not an autobiography, and Gaiman delivered.   I didn't realize just how much faith I had in the book until I read the acknowledgements:  It is with a very heavy heart that I say goodbye to this beloved book.  The Bantam books were wonderful, and this one wasn't a disappointment.  There is nothing else like it in my reading life, and my favorite book from them is the sequel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane.   This was a very nice change of pace from other books that I had read, with a few other good books thrown in for good measure.   But it just didn't meet my expectations for the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole story was a bore... it's like they took a book that was supposed to be about a child's day in the park and just added some more horror as a plot point. I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book. It started off well but then the plot got repetitive, and the writing became sloppy and uneven. The author is apparently well known for writing a lot of short stories, but I have never read a story so full of inconsistencies and poorly executed ideas. I will be disappointed if the book is only a series of short shorts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucks.   If you are looking for a good book, this is not for you.  The characters don't even have a name.  They only have one, which doesn't really help them because they are the only interesting ones.  This just feels like it was written to be an action book.  It has all the action of the movies.  I like action, but it doesn't fit this book. There isn't anything exciting about any of the characters.  Also, the dialogue is awful.  At least have some sort of plot.  What you are left with is just two guys killing the bad guy who killed one of their friends.  There is no tension.  So when you finish reading this, what you get is what the author wanted you to get.  One of the worst action books I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in the beginning of it's life and it wasn't until much later that I read the last pages. I'm not a huge fan of vampires, and to be honest, this book didn't do much for me, but I could relate to the main character being a vampire. I was a little disappointed when it wasn?t really about him finding out about his heritage, but it was still a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this book. I had no expectation that I'd enjoy it. My friend kept raving about the book and he is right to. He is also wrong. I'm going to preface this by saying I don't really read fantasy very often, so I had little idea what to expect.   This book is about a man who was given a second chance at life and chose to go to the desert and live off the land. This is one of those books that makes you feel like it's been written by some real loser. It's like reading some random book written by a loser. This man is basically a complete idiot. This book really made me feel sorry for the people around him and all the problems that he is faced with. There is so much stupidity and ignorance in this book I couldn't even bring myself to read further.   And even the most ridiculous things in this story make absolutely no sense.  -The guy that he works for has the ability to see the past, and it's always about fucking the past. His boss hates his boss and hates everything that the boss has built. This guy also makes a very small mistake in a fight and the guy he fought is instantly killed. The guy who he was working with is almost instantly dead too. And all these things are never brought up again because the guy is so busy killing people. Why doesn't anyone ask why he is in the desert? This guy could have easily killed all these people. And why is his boss constantly beating him up? He seems to be a very powerful man but the guy was just too stupid to figure out what was going on in the first place.     -The man's brother dies because the man didn't do the right thing in the fight. Why does he keep killing all these bad guys even though they are bad? The man has been to hell and back fighting bad guys for years and he just can't figure out how he can help anyone? He just keeps killing them even though he knows he will die? And who gives him orders? No one? Just some random guy?   And the guy's sister dies because she made a mistake. So the guy kills everyone because they are all bad? Even though his sister said that he shouldn't have done it? So he just kept killing people even though his brother said that they should have made the right decision?  "I'll be damned if I let my sister
Write a negative review about a bad book:    ( I'm not a huge fan of this book and am not looking forward to reading the next)   The book's about a girl whose boyfriend's dad bought her a ring that can read her mind.   When she finds out that the ring isn't very good it goes back to her boyfriend but then he goes out of the house and starts to live with another woman.  This was my second novel from this series by the same author but I found the first one to be much better.  I also liked the story of the girl who lived with her brother as a kid and never understood him.  ( My daughter, who is three years old, reads everything and this is one of the first books she's ever read.)   This book is about a teenage girl who discovers her brother's affair and is not pleased.  A little too soon but I like the story and the way it's told. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book can be good if you read through to the end but if you don't read the whole thing you are likely to get confused.   If you enjoyed this story you might enjoy:
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a really good book, but there were a number of places in the book where I felt a little let down by the author's "flourish."   I have a good memory (I like to remember books), and I read all the chapters and thought there was a lot of "fluff" in the story, but for a good book this was pretty thin.   There were a few parts where I just wanted to jump to a new scene and forget what happened in the previous one.    Some of the characters felt so much like cardboard cut-outs they were annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting.   The story is about a young boy and his cat that get separated during a road trip and he ends up being sent to a boarding school that is on the other side of the country. There he meets other kids in the class and they spend the day playing and learning.   the main character is really likable, he is very smart and is really kind. However, he also has this odd habit of wanting to touch other kids, that are much younger then himself. He always makes a pass at the teacher, and a boy named David is one of the many kids he has this weird habit with. David and the other kids just sort of laugh at him, but later on we find out why he does this.  , you will be interested in this book if you are a fan of books about children, or just like reading about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book to study with. I have a very broad foundation and this book gave me lots of tools to help me understand more about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to love this book but it just doesn't work for me.   As a reader of the book, I understand the concepts, but they are very unclear to me. This could be a good novel if it were shorter, but at 700 pages, I can't get into this.  I really liked this book, although I couldn't get through the entire thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought it was a good idea to include an in-depth introduction to each species in this book but it only covered the basics (so for a beginner I thought this was great). The author has a nice and concise style, it is easy to follow but it is repetitive and some of the illustrations look out of place. This book is a good introduction to all of the spiders and I look forward to reading the other books in this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's like reading a story in which the author has given up trying to do a good job and decided that if he was going to write it, he would just write something stupid that someone might like.   I was not enthused about this book.  I'm just annoyed that I wasted my time on this piece of trash.     The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the book has a couple good ideas. I think that the idea for an adventure fantasy with a bad-ass wizard could be used to great effect. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has so many flaws. It has a lot of pages of pictures of men with women and some of the pictures were creepy. Some were also just very hard to look at. It is written by a lesbian, so maybe it is intended to be gay pornography. There is some really creepy descriptions. The best part of the book is when she says that there is no such thing as a good gay porn, it just looks good in the picture. The main characters are too much like characters from the 80's movie "Blow Out" where the main character has no personality. The story is really short, but there are a lot worse short novels out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:       This book is NOT for everyone, and I feel bad for giving it 3 stars.     I did enjoy the first half of the book and wanted to keep reading, but by page 9, the story became repetitive.  I'm not a huge horror fan, but this book definitely wasn't for me.  At the end, I was really disappointed because it was an entertaining read.  Still, if you like stories that are creepy, or are just looking for something to get you going before bed, or anything in between. I'd definitely recommend this book.  If you're looking for a good read, go ahead and read this book, it will be enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to read this book, so the fact that the story was boring and the characters didn't even have names really bothered me. I liked the book better when it was about the characters. In conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read stories and doesn't care about the plot. I have the sequel, but I was never interested in reading that one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was not a disappointment, but was only "good" in my book because the characters were interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was a teenager I tried to read the Lord of the Rings, but I just couldn't get into it.   I was never able to finish, so I gave up on it for years.  Now I love this book, but I had never read Tolkien.  My daughter read it to me and my wife was like "oh, yeah, this is the one!"  So glad I finally bought it!  I am so glad I did because it's great!  So so so much fun to read!  Hail, J.R.R Tolkien:  So, how do you compare this to the first part of the trilogy?   The best part of this book is the dialogue, the characters and the fantasy elements.  The characters, although not all great, are some of the best I have ever seen.  I am very sad that they didn't put the whole of the Ring into this book!   Like most fans, I was hoping that he would tell us what happened after Frodo, Sam and Aragorn left the Shire, but alas, there is nothing like that.  This is a very sad book to read, because it takes a lot of the fun out of reading a book.  However, I do think that this series is great, and the Ring has never been so exciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading about a girl's life story it all came together perfectly but the author is way to shallow about her life and her struggles with the situation in which she finds herself. She is a very shy girl who has a horrible family to deal with. She tries to figure out what she wants in life but she is never able to find it. She gets into trouble with the wrong people and ends up making some very bad decisions.   What I would give this book 5 stars it would be the narrator and if it were only a 1 star book I'd give it a 2 star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book before I got started on the next book in the series.   It was the second book I bought after seeing reviews of the first and the synopsis was so long it just seemed like there were no plot lines.  The only thing that was exciting was the fact I could read the book and not feel cheated.  So, I read it in a couple of days and when I got to the last scene I realized that there were only three characters and two are never seen again.  I felt like the author was just dragging this out, no suspense, no surprises, not even a cliffhanger and the last paragraph was just a couple pages of nothingness and I had forgotten about the entire book.  This book had to be pulled back before the next one so I gave up on it before I start reading the second one.  For me this is a very sad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed it, but there are far too many flaws to consider it a great book. I loved all the characters, but most of them are flat. The story takes place in a world with a very limited amount of magic, but it lacks the depth and detail the rest of the series has.   The book also lacks many great characters and characters in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book a few months back and tried to re-read it this summer, but I couldn't find a good place to start or finish it, and it just didn't sit well with me. Maybe it's because it is not written by the original author, and this is what it was like for me to read the first few chapters. That being said, I really enjoyed it when I read it last year as well. However, I can't say that I would buy it again if I didn't have to pay for it, which means that I probably won't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is terrible. I can hardly believe you would make a book like this when you're not even a writer yourself, but I guess you're lucky you didn't put some good material in the book, otherwise it would have been a waste of money. The plot is too convoluted for my taste, there are too many plot holes (for example, why did the evil mastermind decide that he needed to make his daughter his maid/slave?), and the story is riddled with problems and contradictions. Even though the book is about a family, it is a rather slow-paced story, and doesn't really interest me any more than the average YA/Mature book. I'd probably skip this book if I have to buy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a sucker for books about war. The problem was that this book was about a war, it was about WW1, but when you look at it as a war between two groups of people the one that wins in the end wins more. The story revolves around the first day of the war where the soldiers of the British Empire meet the French and German troops and you wonder, "how are they ever going to win?". After you finish the book you are left asking the same question. One of the reasons I gave this a 5 star is because it was a great read and I loved the world building. I am still in the beginning of the book and will continue reading it. The characters are great too, I like the little background information about the other countries involved in this war.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you find a book on a library website, you can get a free sample or a book for free with a library card.   In the beginning of this book, the author tries to be honest and fair to everyone but I couldn't keep a straight face during the reading because I kept thinking of her father.  The author talks about his childhood, the tragedy of his father's death, and the struggle he went through to become a writer.  Despite all of that, he somehow managed to make his father seem like a nice, sweet, kind person.  At the end of the book, you are left wondering how much of it was just his own memories.  I think this was the only reason I gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars because this book was hard to put down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You are really out of your element with this one, I could have sworn you were doing some sort of cross-dimensional travel here. And the plot is all about the girl (a girl!!) being taken to another dimension, and being forced to take the role of a boy. It was boring to me. The writing is okay, but the character design isn't that good. It's a shame because, even with the dull story, there was some pretty cool action in this one. It has the same problem as my old friend The Great Dinosaur Escape (I have the book, but I don't like it) that I just can't finish it. I could see people actually loving this one (I didn't), but I just don't think it's worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "a good read at least, but it's far from it. If you enjoy science fiction, go for it, if you don't, stay away." -Bibliotheca "if your interested in space opera, and have a high tolerance for the occasional 'novelty' story that tries to ape the great classic novels of SF/F, this book is for you!" -Lazy Reader
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book hoping to find out what happened to the children of the original crew. But unfortunately I found nothing but disappointment. The story is very simplistic. Not even any of the aliens talk about anything else and what happens is explained in great detail in the pre-publication book. The only time I felt a bit moved was in the final scene, where the story seems to be going in a different direction. The main character isn't very well developed and you get the sense that this character is being shoved into a role that is too similar to her father's (who is also a hero). The story isn't really about a lot, the only thing that is explained is the planet's condition (how the children were taken from their planet), but the entire story takes place inside the space station. This would have been better with a better book, but I didn't really expect much from it.  This book was provided for review by the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe I wasted my time reading this book. I didn't like the story line that was thrown in at the end. The main character seems like a total idiot and seems to get what he deserves for doing something stupid in the past. It's all very predictable, with the main character getting into situations and doing things that he is always going to get into, so why did this get added to the book? It seems to be all a big ploy for the author to tell me what to think about this book, I don't think he has any idea what to do with this book so it just ends up being a very uninteresting story. I also don't like how there is a girl in this story that seems to just hate the main hero. She seems very annoyed when he tries to help her out because she has her own problems with her father that she can't seem to accept. I just think the author was trying to make a character that hates the main protagonist to seem more likeable to me, however, it just came across as annoying. I would have liked more characters in the book and more of the characters to have a little more back story and development so I could see why the main characters is doing what he is doing. I thought the way the story was told and the main plotline was so predictable and lame made it impossible to get involved with. The ending of this book was also not that great either. It was sad, but it was over pretty fast and the story seemed to get lost quickly. Overall, I will probably not be picking up the next book by the author and I would avoid it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was given this book by a friend as a gift. It's not good but I was excited about reading it, and then I got a nasty note from the book's publisher.  You can buy it from Amazon and it won't take your money.   It's a sad, sad story about a woman who lost her kid, and her own heart, over a stupid, cheap joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is terrible - but it wasn't really bad. I am reading the first book in the series and I've got to say that I am rather surprised. There were parts that were well done but many more that just fell flat. I felt like the author was trying too hard to be a good writer and so the characters were either boring, flat or just bad. It wasn't always the same characters but sometimes the story seemed to revolve around a specific person. If I were to read another of this series I would not be excited by what happens. This is the worst series I have read - I am still reading the second book so I can see if the author changes his or her story style or if I will like the next book better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book, it's good for a quick read but i was not impressed at all, it was really quite confusing and poorly written. It wasn't a terrible read by any means, but it wasn't anything great either and i didn't care at all about it. I have a feeling that a good part of the reason why I don't like this book is because the characters are so thin. They are so much less than the main character and in fact the main characters are such a thin and flat to start with that they can't really be relied on to do anything. The reason why this book was so confusing for me is because all the dialogue is done through dialogs and because of this they are so badly worded i felt like i was reading something from a different book because of the amount of spelling and grammar mistakes. I felt like the main villain was very shallow but they never showed her at all. There are so many questions that i want answered i wish i could have had more details about it but as it is the author just gave me a little more and the rest of it was just not good at all to read. So that's a bad start to a good start i guess. The author of this book does write a good story, the world he puts together is very interesting and there are good characters but at the same time he doesn't do much of anything that is different from other fantasy books i've read before and so i feel like it just felt kind of average. It really wasn't like a bad novel by any stretch of the imagination, but i just can't help but feel like he failed to live up to the expectations that i had of him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a person who has an evil twin who is a sociopath. The story is about how a person will always do the wrong thing when given the chance. A couple years ago I took the book off my library shelf and I haven't been back since. The first time I heard about the book I was excited about the premise, but the story never moved forward. The main characters seemed to have similar traits and I felt there was not enough character development. The ending also seemed rather unsatisfying, although it was kind of sad. It seemed like the book had a lot of potential, but it just never got there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has many flaws, however if you don't mind reading a bit of a "mystery" in this one, it's fun. This book is a good read for anyone who is into mystery books. I will not be purchasing this book again, but it was a fun mystery.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very dull and tedious book.    If I was the kind of person that reads books that are boring, I would have been bored out of my skull with the first few pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My experience with this book was very disappointing.   After reading reviews of this book I knew it would not live up to the hype.  A lot of the content that I thought was going to be a great read in the back of the book is nowhere to be found.  There's a section in the book where the author describes a very interesting theory about the universe, and it was so interesting that I was actually excited to read more about it in the next book.  Then it ended.  That was it.  I could go on and on about all the little issues with this, but I'll leave it to a book review to explain them.  But back to the bad stuff...  I have read and reviewed books before where the story was fantastic.  Sometimes it would have all the right parts, and other times it would be great but the execution was just not there, and in this case it was just missing.  As a science fiction fan, I always expect the author to be able to create worlds where I can really believe the stuff they are talking about.  Instead this book just fell short. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First off, the book is a rip-off.   The book's premise is "What happens if you find out you have two penises?" And the author, Dr. Joseph Breuer, claims to be using a "two-way transgenic" technique on his penis to treat patients with impotence.  I mean, if he is doing this he is obviously cheating and should be prosecuted.  The fact that he has two penises, two vaginas and two clitorises, has also been confirmed by other medical researchers as well as the original paper on which this book is based: a study of 25 male-to-female transsexuals, which found that the subjects with two vaginas were no different than their cis-gendered counterparts with one vagina, whereas those with two penii were different in their sexuality from the two control groups (Cates & Kessels, 1986).  The main issue of the book that bothers me is that the "two" genital types are not described, but instead the reader is supposed to assume that the author has "rebuilt" both the "female" clitoris (an old trope used to describe a penis) with a "female vagina".  However, the fact that the clitoris does not resemble the female vaginal canal in a large number of the male genitalia (e.g., testes) makes it impossible to infer that this will work.  This is like claiming that because an ostrich's tail does not have a foot, it does not belong to it.  Finally, the author claims that the result of the surgery can lead to "penis-reproduction-free sexual relationships", but we have yet to see any evidence that these "penises-without-vaginas" actually lead to more sexual partners than the two-vesical patients.  So what's the point?  As it turns out, there is a difference in the ways men and women perceive their genitals.  Women think their vulvas look and feel more like their genitalia: they feel more stimulated when stimulated by someone else's penis.  It is the fact of their clitoris that they are interested in having their genitals stimulated by another.  However women are also very picky about the penis they use for stimulation and for penetrative sex.  Most women prefer a very small penis because the clitoral stimulation is more intense.  Men, on the other hand, are quite picky in
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best book I've read in a while, but I am sure that some readers of this will not like it as I did. The narrator was not a very good one (at least not in the main part of the book) and the writing is not that good, but the main thing that I disliked about this book was the ending. This was an awful ending that did not make the story good and I felt that the author should have done something with it, like giving us a more ambiguous ending or something, as it seemed like she was just showing a bad end with a bad ending to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's an interesting and unusual story, but doesn't have the charm or depth of a good fantasy story.   My biggest complaint, aside from being short, is that I was disappointed that the author chose to have the princess (who's actually the only one who ever realizes the dangers of her magic) be human, instead of a giantess.  It seems that most female characters are either giants, elves or dwarves.  I was hoping the book would take a different course, but there's a lot to enjoy about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a total train wreck.   The story is well-executed and the plot progresses nicely until about the third chapter. At this point, the book's characters are introduced to a completely non-existent plot (i.e. a series of strange events happening across town which the protagonist is unable to explain) which then leads into the next chapter. This leads to all the characters being introduced to all sorts of nonsense, and the characters themselves being reduced to stereotypes. It's like watching a film with no dialogue and only one shot (a close-up of the heroine's cheek). The ending is even worse, as it leads into an even more ridiculous plot involving a "psychic" who claims to be able to tell people's future. After the last page, it becomes obvious that the whole thing is an excuse to introduce even more characters and make the last few chapters even more of an anticlimax.   I can't even describe how infuriating this book is. I read it for the plot, but it's so poorly executed that it's ridiculous. I'm not an avid reader of psychological thrillers, but I would've paid a ridiculous amount of money for a book that's a train wreck, but had better writing. This book really wasn't worth it.  33 of 39 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first picked this book up, I was skeptical. I thought it was kind of a bore. Well, I gave it another chance, and it was even worse than I thought. In fact, it was worse than a book by JK Rowling that I loved. This book was a train wreck. At one point, the author says "There's a certain amount of truth in the old adage "if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything." Well, that was definitely not true here!" (If this were written by Rowling, I would have been outraged and demanded to know who wrote it!) And this book is not for kids; it's not a good book for any age group, and not even a good one for the tween set. The author was very disrespectful to women and was not a nice person at all! I could see how this book might appeal to some men, but it is definitely not for me or my son. I will not be buying this book, and I will never recommend it to a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good read but the ending is anticlimactic. I like the character development but it's not enough to make up for the anticlimax.   What about the characters:   - An interesting mix of races/nationalities, but very few females.     - The main character is a bit of a jerk and an immature asshole at times, but he's still the one I'd take out to the pub with a beer in hand (though not a regular beer).   Summary:  The main bad guy is called 'The Devil', and he and his band of merry men and women are responsible for destroying all good in the world. The bad guys seem to have a certain fondness for drinking, as well as a lot of bad luck (the bad guys never seem to get any kills and they are often caught and beaten to a pulp). However, the main bad guys do have their good points - they are good at their job, they get along well with the good guys, and they often get the best deals they can for goods. But even with all of this good in them, they often are outsmarted and forced to work for the bad guys. I don't know if it's all my fault for wanting to have my cake and eat it too, but I do not approve of all of the violence. I suppose you could argue that it's part of the fun of it.   They are the only bad guys that I've ever seen in a game of Doom, or in a lot games as well. The characters could have been developed a bit more, but you're left wondering how the game would have turned out without them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was not bad at all but it was not well written or edited either.   The dialogue was great but the plot was not.  The whole book felt rushed and that was the main reason I gave it 3 stars.  My daughter said it felt like a movie and that may be right but you can't compare it to a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book 4 stars because I really liked the concept. I was really looking forward to reading this book. I found it interesting that the story did not focus on the military, and that some of the characters were not just warriors but rather "socially inept" "self-important" people. That being said, the plot was really weak, and did not feel that the book was taking place in a realistic, believable setting. Also the characters in the book were very stereotyped and had very little depth or interestingness to them. I didn't enjoy the plot, because it didn't seem to have a beginning, middle, or end, it just went on and on and it was rather tedious. My favorite character was definitely the hero, who has no real purpose in the story besides protecting his sister and family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an absolute joke and does not deserve any reviews. The story line is one I have seen in many other stories I have read (this one especially, but also others) but in this case it is completely implausible. It is a story line that will make you roll your eyes and laugh at the absurdity of it all, but in the end will leave you feeling as if you just wasted your time. I did not want to leave the book before finishing it as I had come to expect the sort of stories I found in other books (but I have not yet read it).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending of this book was pretty crappy. The main character gets killed and there is absolutely no reason for it. Then the author comes out of nowhere and gives the reader an explanation why it was necessary. That's about it. The author is obviously a psychopath who enjoys killing. I don't really get it. I like good writing more than I like evil. It doesn't make me sad or anything. It just sucks. If you like to kill people you might want to avoid this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an old one that I read in my 20s. I know about the "theory" that the earth is only 8,000 years old. But I'm surprised that the scientists were so adamant in their belief that humans originated somewhere else, perhaps the Middle East or Africa.   "When God speaks to one of His children, He uses an unusual language."   And of course there was no proof or evidence for anything of the sort:  This is the kind of thing that keeps me up at night. It's all very well to make up a story about how something "came" from nothing, but what kind of a "cousin" would come up with such a nonsense. And it's especially odd that this story about an ancient stone circle with an image of an animal which they call the "Lamassu" (a combination of "lame" and "lamb") has been made into a "religious text."  I'd have thought this "lost text" would be more of a problem for the religious community than for scientists.  "The image of the camel is an apt metaphor for the image of man: he is a horse without a bridle or a harness, without reins or a bridled horse, a wild animal on a mission, a wandering shepherd, a living statue, a fallen leaf or stone, a stone in the water, a child without arms, a shadow."  For the record, the image is of a lamb or a goat.  This text was written by a Christian scholar, so I suppose we should read that as a religious text, but it also seems like a bit of a stretch to me to attribute it to a supposed ancient race of aliens.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are shallow and there is a lack of real character development, even though this book was set in ancient India. The story is a farce and not worth the time.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book but it was so boring that I gave up. I'm looking forward to reading something with a good plot. If they keep it on paper I could still read it and find something to like.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was still a teenager in the 70s. It's a horror story, but its a really good one. The characters are all just really likable, even though they may seem kind of weird. This is a good book for someone who wants to scare the crap out of their kids.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book isn't a good book.   I feel like I should give it an A or a B but I just couldn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This was a book about a girl who was born with no arms or legs. She grows up in a society where nobody cares for disabled people so she has no one to be herself around. At the age of 17 she is given a prosthetic arm and legs. This is really a well written book about this young girl's struggles and the way they all seem to be intertwined.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started this book with low expectations and no expectations. I thought that it would be a good story, but sadly it wasn't. I can't explain it, but there was a lot of sex, drugs, and swearing, and the last 30 minutes was not a pleasant experience. It was a very slow and boring story with no plot. I hope that it will get better, but for now it's just a very dull read.   This is a story that I will be giving to a friend who is looking to give a more adult read to her teenager. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but then again, I couldn't really recommend anything in general.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... This book is just that.   It is not a great book and is a waste of time.  The writing is very good but it does not take the reader to a place where we want to go.  A lot of the dialogue is not interesting, which I get is the problem with good novels.     "The main characters of the book are also a bunch of dicks.  Their names are:  A.C. who is a very nice man, and  N.N., who is the baddest dude in the book."   Another person who says this: "I think the only reason you like the story of the main characters is because it was written by the aforementioned author."  I was hoping for more of a story, but I guess you can't go wrong with a group of friends getting together and being friends. I like a good group story.  Here are a couple of the things I enjoyed about the book: - I liked how N. went to her house and got a new dress after their party to wear. - I loved how the author took the time to explain why N. and A. were like that:  "It's probably hard to understand this because you have never been like this before, but when you have someone that is so much different than the person you used to be, you can never completely trust the person and so you have to keep an eye on them." - I also loved how N.'s "new" dress was so cute.  I enjoyed the book because N. kept changing to be different, and I liked the fact that she kept a sense of fun while changing. - It also made me realize that I need to get my mind off of the horrible way I'm not like everyone else around me.  My Rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a little bit skeptical to purchase this book.   The book had no reviews that I could find online, so I just thought, maybe I don't like this book?   Boy am I wrong!   This book really surprised me.  The story was pretty awesome.  I've read lots of fantasy books and this was easily the most exciting of the group.  This is the only book in the series I've had issues with: it's too much fantasy and not enough mystery.  However, the characters were good.  It was easy to follow, easy to read and I enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I have no idea what happened with this book, I bought it and never got to start it. The book is great, I love all the details of the book, but the book was never finished, at least not as far as I know, I tried to look into how the book could be finished, but they just don't let anybody finish a book they've started, so they just keep on going.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry to say that this is a bad read. This book is a waste of time and money. It doesn't even attempt to be a good story. The story is a rehash of the movie, but is presented in a very uninspired way. The plot is boring. The characters are lame. The action is lame. There is very little plot to speak of. The writing style of the book is really horrible. It's incredibly hard to understand anything because the writing style is so weird and nonsensical. The only thing this book has going for it is that the author is a fan of the movies. That's about it. The author also has a large collection of Harry Potter books in which he has used many of the same characters from the book (ahem, Voldemort). In fact, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II has a lot of the characters from this book in it. This is truly a waste. I recommend anyone who is interested in reading a book to pick up another book. Or even better, to read a non-Harry Potter book. You'll thank me later.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   " This is a great book.   It is a really great book, it is fun to read.  It teaches us that sometimes life does suck, but if we can find the right people in our lives who support us through it all we will be better off.  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It had a good plot but the writing was terrible and the plot is a poor use of the character of Nelvana. It would have been better if it wasn't over long. The story would have better taken on a more character-centric tone with a more interesting story line. It really doesn't give you enough information to be a good reader until the last third. There are a lot of cliche and cliched things, but a couple didn't really interest me (like a guy who can't say his feelings) or bothered me (he can't talk to his mom) and a few things (like his mom's feelings for Nelva) did bother me. I wouldn't want to read a book like this for a long period of time, but if you like a good story- and I love reading stories that get me to think and feel and be involved in the story rather than just watching the events happen without involvement or involvement of the characters - you'll probably love this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed it when I first read it. It was enjoyable and didn't take too long to read. It had me intrigued and curious. The first half was interesting. I was curious about where the story was going and how it was going to be resolved, but once I got to the part where the kids were going to go to school, the storyline changed and the story fell flat for me. This is a very short, light book with some action. It got my interest but didn't keep my interest. Maybe if I could've enjoyed the story more I would have enjoyed it, but I didn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book at a library and got some good info from it, but there are a lot of things that bothered me about it: 1) The plot. 2) The characters. 3) The main character, especially her behavior toward her family, as well as her parents, etc. There were a lot more things I would have liked to have seen.    In case this is not obvious: I have been a critic of the book for years, and I still find it to be a poor read. As a writer, the book has too much of the same material, too little of anything different. The characters are well-written, but the plot is so formulaic that the reader is often bored and disappointed. I do not understand why the book, written by a woman, was rejected by so many publishers and only recently was accepted by another, which did not make me feel any better.  "No, I did not go in search of the truth but just as many others in the past, in search for a myth."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the beginning of this book, the author describes a young child who, after being hit by a car, is transported to a "somewhere far away" where he has to solve a series of puzzles in order to return home. The idea sounds good but the book is riddled with problems and inconsistencies and never manages to come to an end.   "There were times when he was so lost, he didn't know which way was up or down or sideways," the book begins, and the description of the child's plight is nothing but a rambling mess. The book quickly goes into a long and rambling discussion about the way the writer's life was like in high school where the writer explains how there are a lot of "hoes" in the book but he managed to avoid any because he wasn't interested in the girls, but is a big fan of the boy next door. This description would normally be pretty annoying but he manages to turn it into the highlight of the book, so I gave it a pass.  (hide spoiler) Well, the protagonist is a young boy who's parents have passed away from illness, and he now lives with his grandmother. He's an "interesting" boy, and we're told that he has the intelligence of an "intelligent turtle," but he lacks the normal human emotions. He likes the "frightening, weird" environment of the house (the narrator is very quick to state the house has a "troubled" history), but he can't even tell the difference between two friends.  When he has a friend over for dinner, the friend tells him he's "finally going to become one of those people he's always heard about," and the boy gets so upset at this he yells at his friend to leave the house and never come back, or else he'll beat him up.  "He wasn't a bully," he says, when he's told the friend has a girlfriend, but what exactly does he mean when he says "be a bully"? He never explains it again, but it's clear the narrator doesn't quite buy this. The narrator describes the boy as "an interesting boy" but then says he's a "bad person" for doing something like this, despite the fact the boy was only trying to protect his friend. I'm sure I'm not alone in believing that this description of a "poor, stupid person" is one of the worst I've ever read
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book but unfortunately I was very disappointed.   It is an interesting book, but it did not satisfy my needs.  The characters are not convincing, the plot is not believable.  There are many problems with this book.  I wish this book were better written as I would like to read more of these books from this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had only known this book was a fake, I would have never purchased this.   This book is made of nothing but fabrications. It is a story from a "fictional" book and yet it does not give any idea what is the real "facts" about the subject.   " In October of 2013 I was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. I found a lump in my neck during the middle of the night and was told I had cancer."  The cancer actually started in December of 2012 and it went into remission by August 2013 and it never went into any remission for a whole year before I started chemotherapy. In a real way, I never knew about my cancer at all.  This book was never an issue before I found out.  The author is lying to make a point with her story.  In a way it was.  I was not a patient of a Dr. Cawthon (the book writer) but I did hear about Dr.Cawthons research and I did meet her. Dr. Kowalski was the only real doctor I have ever met but I never met Dr. L.  What I don't understand is why this book would be in the cancer library. Drs. C. and K. have nothing to do with this book, and yet this book has everything to do about cancer.  When you have cancer, your family is going to be devastated.    There are many ways for people to cope with the reality of your illness but Dr.Kowalskis and Dr.L have absolutely no experience with that reality.   I will never know what Dr.R. is thinking or how he feels.  Is it possible that the book might not have been written by one of those real people but a fictional book, created to make the author look good.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have read to date, despite its many charms. One might even say it is a disaster in the making. My main problem with the book is the fact that it is over too fast. After the opening chapter, it seemed like every chapter was a major event for the main characters. It had been quite some time since I read a novel that focused on one character's perspective on the events around them. But there's nothing wrong with a slow, focused story (this one even has some of that to it, although I'm not a huge fan of the character's dialogue). But this one was the complete opposite. It started so fast and with so little information, that after some time I just gave up. It did not really start off well either. The first chapter, for instance, is about the main character's childhood, his best friend, a love interest and a series of incidents and interactions that are not explained at all, in favor of a short flashback with a character that's mentioned in the book but never seen again. This was not good for me at all. It was like a one trick pony, with little explanation of what happens next. I was not impressed with any of the other characters either, which was especially bad because the main male character was supposed to be an intellectual and well-read person, but instead is a shallow idiot that constantly makes dumb choices. And his best friends are a pair of annoying louts, with no sense of humor, who always try to get him in trouble. Not a very good premise for a romance. A lot of the book consisted of the main hero going to visit the heroine, then returning, and then going to talk with her, then going back and back, with one scene at a time. I felt like I was doing an entire semester's worth of schoolwork in a book that lasted roughly 20 minutes. And I mean 20 minutes of work, not 20 chapters. A slow paced novel that is a nightmare to read. I also felt that it was lacking a real sense of character, which I've come to expect from a high fantasy novel, so much so that I'd be surprised if it weren't for the fact this is a prequel. The lack of a sense of personality was also noticeable in the female characters, especially the woman who was the main love interest. All the women are either one dimensional caricatures of some stereotypical fantasy creature (like the Queen of the Elves,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *   -This book really made my day. I was able to relax, read a very relaxing, relaxing, calming, relaxing book, then come home to get my hair and nails done -My daughter and I each went through a different story. I had trouble understanding a bit of the writing but it didn't bother me. I love the book and it made my whole week. Thank you for an amazing read! -The description sounds like a very good book... It may not be. I am just a college student not very good at writing so I wasn't able to read the book as well as I wanted to. The stories that I read were very different from what I imagined them to be. It seemed like I was reading a book to explain the characters in my head and then not knowing anything about the book other than the basic description.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book as a gift for a child because I wanted to help her better understand how books were written by "experts" in the field. This book made her feel very stupid for being a girl and reading. She said it was so bad, that she had to stop and go to bed. It really doesn't help that she didn't read the whole book, only the last three pages. The book starts out really good and I was hoping for more from the author, but sadly the next page shows her saying "there's a book here, it just happens to be about a girl who wants to go to a boy's school because she hates boys". I was disappointed that I have to put in a book review because my child was having a bad day and it hurt her feelings. Also, I'm glad I read this book in front of her and not in front my laptop.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book is not a bad reader.   Unfortunately,   I don't believe that this book   was a good book.  It was a book that I should have read and I will not read the rest of the series.   I do not believe that these reviewers are being critical, and I agree with them. This is a good story and a good fantasy novel with well-done magic systems and an intriguing plot, but it has none of the magic and world building that the series has been known for. It's a fun fantasy, but there's not enough magic or plot for me to recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just don't like this book. I will not go into the book itself, just the author. The only reason I even bought the book is because I wanted to read about a very common disorder that I suffer from (and many others besides), which is chronic pain, anxiety, OCD, and phobias. So, my husband had picked it up for me and when I opened the book, I was pretty disappointed because this book did not make me feel that way about it. First off, the author does not even attempt to be descriptive of the disorder itself, because he is a medical doctor. So if he doesn't know what a person with Chronic Pain is going through, it's pretty ridiculous. Second, he writes in a rather flippant manner to the audience and to the reader. Even though the books is not written in a very scholarly manner, I do not think that is a good way to write a book for a lay audience like myself. It's too easy for the author to say "hey, this book is all about _____, if you are also _____ then you are _____". But the book does not actually discuss _____ because _____ does not exist in this book!   Lastly, the book lacks any type of good feedback, whether it's positive or negative.  I will try to summarize the book to the best of my ability:  The author is very much biased and doesn't even try to be factual or unbiased. I believe that if someone is not diagnosed with a particular disorder, and wants to write about the disorder, then the book must contain some type of positive feedback.  The book is a series of three books (the second in the series is " The Complete Guide to Coughs and Flues ", which is a more general description of Chronic Pain) all related to the disorder: The first book (The Complete Guide) is titled " Chronic pain: what it is and how to find a solution" (which is an extremely outdated description of the disease).   The second book ( The Chronic Pain Clinic ) is titled: "The Comprehensive Guide to Chronic Pain". This book contains very few actual information about the disease. The third book is the last book in the entire series, and is entitled "The Complete Book of Chronic Pains". This is a compilation of the previous three books.   All three books contain some factual information (how the disease is defined) and some type or feedback
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is bad. The characters are flat. The main character is flat. And the main character doesn't care about anything but having sex with her best friend. The author had a good idea, but I would've been better off with another book by her. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars but then again, the book is supposed to be a "feminist fantasy" so that's really just a bonus.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping that the book would be a really good read!  I would have loved this book if it had the same depth of character that The Lord of the Rings has. Instead it is a book that is just boring.  The whole book was boring, I never got that deep feeling of a new world with a unique culture, a new language, and a lot of magic. I felt that the story had a lot more depth if it was about the characters' past instead of the journey.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this as a story and never realized that the main character is a woman in the same story. It just felt like a gender-flipping or sex change novel. If you are not into gender-fluid characters, it is a really great read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure why the reviews on here say the book isn't a "classic." I don't see why it can't be. I'm a great fan of Stephen King's work. The only problem is that "A Good Man Goes to War" has so many "holes" in it that it just doesn't feel like a King novel at all. And since "A Long Way Gone" came out so long ago, I have no idea where I stand on the whole "King" vs. "Kirk" thing. I think "A Very Long Way" may be more King than Kirk, but "A Gun for Sam" is the closest I could imagine.   The plot is a little weak, but there are a couple good moments in it. It is also pretty lighthearted and fun. I don´t mind this type of book at all, but this one was too much for me. The characters and plot are interesting, but not so much. And the story is not terribly long (only a page a side) so that was not too much of a problem for me, but it would be nice if the story were longer. The story would have been better if it wasn't so short, because it had so many holes in it, that it felt like a "Keeper of the Keys" type book.   the book could have been a "King book," because the plot points that were in the book were well done, but the rest of it, was lacking.  - "I found myself thinking of this book during one of the moments when the real, awful horror of what I was reading sunk in. In this book, King explores the idea of people's fear of the unknown. At the same time, he shows us that fear is not always a bad thing. Sometimes, fear is good."   - "A gun for Sam, though I thought it was a good book, was just a book. It was not about war, and it certainly was not a great book, even though it had some very interesting plot twists."   and   " The characters weren't very interesting, and the story was a bit boring. This book is just a disappointment, and in my opinion, a bit too short, even by King standards."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because I thought it would be a good read and was disappointed when it turned out not to be. The book is about a woman who is in the hospital and is on the brink of death when she is visited by a spirit that will change her life forever. Unfortunately it is not as the spirit says and she goes on to get hit by a car and die later that night. The spirit is kind of interesting and has a few good lines, but overall it is just not interesting enough to be worth the read.   It's not terrible per se, it's a very good book, but it's not good enough to make it an enjoyable read and the only reason I gave it a 3 is because I really wanted to like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, I read this book as a freshman in college. I'd already read the trilogy but hadn't gotten to the other one yet. I was pretty familiar with the characters (and I loved it), but I did not read this one until much later when it became required reading. The book was the first I'd ever read in any of these series, and I knew it would be a lot of fun. The plot is really interesting and I love the characters, even the ones that aren't as likable as the others, like the boy who is in love with the girl who's sister is a monster. But, there are problems with the plot. First, it gets a little tedious pretty fast. There's a very long chapter in which one girl gets a monster for Christmas and then spends the whole day with it for days and days. I thought it was very silly and kind of gross. (The book is about a year and a half old, so I didn't understand how much better the world has become since then.) In fact, there's a scene in which a girl's brother is in a wheelchair and doesn't really know how to use it, which I thought was pretty depressing. The other two main characters are all very different. The girl who has a monster, who's really cute and a good friend of the main character, is very annoying and rude and is a bit of a bully. But she's not really that bad. I just couldn't really like her much. The main character's best friend is a total asshole and has no problem insulting him and basically saying that his friend is stupid. The monster is actually kind of cool. It's not a person like a human but something like a kind of creature. It doesn't feel like a person because it doesn't have any feelings or emotions at all. I'm not sure what's worse: the girl with the monster or her friend? The two of them are really annoying. As a whole, it's kind of boring and I can't imagine how it could have worked as a stand alone novel. I think it's supposed to be a "how to get to know" book and it was mostly just told from the viewpoint of two characters that were barely interesting. (In fact, when they are the main characters, it becomes really annoying.) There's also some violence and sexual content, but not really anything I didn a problem with. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I have this one but was told it was terrible when I was reading it, but I don't find it terrible. It doesn't feel like any of the other books I have read. The characters don't do much but are more interesting than the other characters in this book. There is a lot of writing and I found it difficult to follow along to the point the book went, but if you are like me, the book has the right amount of plot, and it is a good read if you want to go through the main character and see how he changes." --Sandy from Michigan.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst to read since the other   it's in my top 3, it should be in the top 5, but I just can't go into detail because I want it to be the best it can be.  I'm not sure why it's my favorite, I can understand that it's the easiest to read and read fast because it's one of the ones I don't feel like I need to read over and over again.  The main characters are fun to watch in action and I do enjoy how the main characters look and dress (which is a shame I can't comment on the women, they look like they were written by a fan of some TV show and have a lot of sexiness in their costumes).  The plot itself is pretty much the best thing that happened to the series I've seen since The Avengers, if only the characters were more well developed.  However, I think it's more because I don' t think that the characters are developed that the plot is bad.  There's the whole time travel thing I think.  Also, what is with this love triangle and it's like the only two guys are the bad guys (I can understand why this would be that way because it would make sense for the bad guy to be evil, but they're like the bad kind of villains, so that makes no sense for them to be villains) or the three of them.  What made it good: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are annoying, the plot is a complete mess, the world is a horrible, boring place that the characters live in, the romance is boring, and the ending is a mess.   There's no point to anything here, other than to pad out a two hundred page book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the whole thing, but I'm going to stop here.   This book is just not worth my time and money.  It was a really good book for people who have no idea about the history of a subject but are interested in the topic.  The people who are interested (and the author has written so well about them) are interesting.  In all of his books, he does a good job of describing the culture of a culture.  While the people in the book are interesting, the subject itself is really, really dull.  And the story line (the war between the US and Canada) isn't very interesting either.  There's a lot of conflict, but the conflicts have little impact on the story.  A lot of the characters are just stereotypical bad guys.  I wish there was more action, more action and excitement.  It does include some nice descriptions of military history.  You will definitely learn something about Canada.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This was a good book, but... It had some interesting details and an interesting perspective about the American political system in the 19th century. However, the author is a political partisan and does a bad job of representing his own views accurately. I can see how the political and social changes that led to the formation of the country can be a good source for historical research, but the author's political views (and those of his colleagues) are a bit off-putting and make the author seem biased.  I really loved this book and I am so happy I got to read it before it was put on the back burner. It was well researched and had some good details. I think the author could use a bit of editing and polishing in order to make the book a bit less political.    I like the author as a scholar. He has an excellent grasp on the period and is a good debater. However this book is far too political for me to give a positive review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a complete and utter waste of time.   I have seen many books on the subject, and have used various methods of measuring time. While measuring time, I have found that using a clock and using my calendar is often the easiest.  So, I did that.  When I took the time to write down this book's title, I figured that I would get my clock out and measure it myself.  The title is not only misleading, but it also sounds like a joke, like you have to buy something, or do something to learn it.  My husband and I have been trying to learn this game for several years, and we finally figured out the secret.    I think it was the word "Golgotha."    This is a joke.  It is also one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  As an instructor for an alternative method of time measurement, I am disgusted with this book.  I think there is nothing wrong with teaching people to measure time in a variety of ways, but this is a bad way.  If you want to learn about this method, please, please check out the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is too predictable, too short, and not well written.   It has some good ideas (especially for a first book in a genre like magic) but unfortunately it's just too predictable and short for that to make a difference.  It's a great idea to have a magic school in a fantasy setting, but it should have taken the time to develop its own world instead of just jumping right into a world of elves and swords. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my favorite novels and series!   This is my third time reading The Dragonlance Chronicles, but this is my first time reading Dragonlance: The Crystal Shard.  This book is excellent.  It takes a very familiar genre and turns it on its ear.  I know a lot of people don't like these sort of books because they're too old for them.  But this series is very relevant today.  The first part is very well done.  There are some elements that may remind people of other fantasy books and the other parts are original and fun.   As a big fantasy reader I would have liked a few more references and in the first book it feels a little bit like there's so much information that it feels disjointed.  However, I think it would have been better if you knew every element of the other books beforehand.  Like I said, the series was made before The Lord of the Rings came out, so it doesn't feel like Tolkien.  When you look back on it, it was a very fun ride and it's still enjoyable today.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was awful.   After starting the book, I knew that this book was going to be bad.  I had a lot of expectations.  It seems to be a combination of a lot if terrible reviews of some popular science fiction and fantasy books.  For me, it falls short in two categories: The main character doesn't seem to understand what she is doing and how she is supposed to do it, and the book spends a lot more time on the main character's personal and social life than it does the science. I don't mind these things as much as I would have liked, but I will still avoid this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have seen this book used as a tool to teach students about evolution, but it is completely misleading. Darwin did not use the word "adaptation" to describe natural selection in the 1859 paper. However, he did discuss natural selection and natural selection by natural selection. However he did not discuss it in the same way evolutionists do, because Darwin did have a naturalistic explanation for how selection could have come about (evolution by natural processes). This was not the case for Lamarck, who used natural selection as a method of evolving plants and animals in his own book (see Natural Selection and the Origin of Species by Henry Gee). I would not use this book in a Biology course at a university, because it doesn't provide any scientific evidence that evolution can explain why we are here in the first place. There is a reason for our existence (the earth being created through a process called "creation" ). We are not here simply by chance or coincidence. - January 25, 2006I have seen a good use of the theory of evolution in this book
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but a few years back I purchased a copy of The Complete Book of Thais for my own personal use only. I did have a little bit of success with it at a dinner party, but in the end I found the stories were too similar to the existing Thai stories in the book, and I found myself wanting something new.   And so I did not have the pleasure of finally having the pleasure to experience Thais. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (if the review is a full 5 stars, I think it deserves a five-star rating) - There's not a lot to recommend this book, especially if you're looking for a light and easy-to-follow story. If you're a fan of the Dresden Files (who isn't?) or you want a simple book to read while relaxing, this book might work for you. - Unfortunately, the book really sucks from the start. As a reader who has read the Dresden series from the very start, I can see how people would expect a lot from this book. But I can't say that I enjoyed it. And I can feel that it's just going to be a chore to get through. - The book, even though written in the form of a letter to her mother, never really reveals much of the story. And there's no development for the main character. (I'm not entirely sure what the purpose is in the letter to be honest.) - This book is all action and suspense from the beginning. In a good way, I have to say. But that's all it is. It's nothing too interesting about the characters or plot. And in the end it all kind of comes down to a few really bad choices and what seems to be some kind of magical spell.   I am a huge fan of "Failed Hero" by Aimee Bender. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters were the weakest part of the book. They felt like cardboard cut-outs. It was like watching a movie and someone who couldn't get in character did a crappy voiceover. All the other characters were so different and interesting in their own way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the best books I've read all year. My students have been wanting to get their hands on this book for quite some time, but I haven't been able to give it to them in a timely manner. This is not a book for kids.   So they will get the full effect of reading this.  So, I read this in June or July, but now that I'm nearing the end I feel I owe it some sort of review. I got this book on the recommendation of a friend who has kids in his school and who I think I know well. I was extremely happy to learn about the concept of reading aloud and the need to write in a journal when the other option seems so much more practical. This book has had me thinking about it for some time. I have been a big fan of "Gravity's Rainbow" but never understood the motivation to keep it a children's book and never have I actually owned the book. This just seems like a perfect way to introduce this to kids. If your kids aren't reading, then this seems like the perfect time for you to get into them reading as well. If you are a parent, I recommend it as well for the joy of reading and the love of teaching a little one to read. It is a short, easy to read book that anyone can understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best story I've read in a long time.   I am still reading it, it's just hard to read when I know the book's ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was interested in this book until the end, when the author, Michael J. Sullivan, decided to write a book review instead of giving the book a fair evaluation in the first place.     His book review starts out well, with the usual praise for the book, and then he makes a complete 180, starting out by telling us that the book was bad, but only to describe its weaknesses rather than the strengths of his own work.  If you are a good writer, you will write bad books that make you rich.  As he goes on to say, the book is not bad, or even bad.  His first problem is the lack of an adequate introduction, and it does not get any better as he goes through the book.  Sullivan tries to make a bad-writing-bad-writer story about a mediocre writer who is also a bad writer.  It is a classic case of the good guy getting screwed by the bad guy, except the bad guys in this story are supposed to be his own editors who refused to let him publish his work.   Sullivan's book is a terrible disappointment, and I can only conclude that he knows that this is what his readers want to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would have given this book 4 stars, but it is just not a good book in any way. The story is good, the characters are interesting, the author is likable, and I would rate it high in any other field, except this one. The book begins with a lot of exposition.   And I'm not talking about the first few pages. The author opens up this story with a whole lot of detail about the setting of the book, which is about a young woman, Anna, whose family is killed in a fire and she goes on a quest to find the person who did this.  I've read enough horror and fantasy to know that this kind of exposition is common in many genre books.  It's a technique used a lot, particularly in young adult novels.  However, Anna doesn't have a problem following this tradition.  The story, which centers around a girl on a journey to save her kidnapped brother is a solid read, if a little on the slow side.  She has a very unique journey going on, a journey from her home in the south, through the desert, and eventually to a magical castle in the north.  But the book really starts to go downhill here. The first half is interesting.  Anna and her brother are on the journey when they are attacked by something out of a horror movie.  We're never sure what the creature is, but Anna eventually manages to kill it, and the adventure begins.  Unfortunately, the pacing of the journey gets really slow at this point.  At times, it feels like a bad part of the story is dragging the rest of the novel down.  As far as the main plot goes, it's interesting. The journey to the kingdom of The North, where Anna's brother was taken captive, is interesting and Anna makes new friends.  And the plot itself gets interesting as the characters start discovering more about the strange creatures they are fighting against. However, the way the plot was told left a lot to be desired.    The plot does finally pick up at the very end.  There was more interesting stuff going on here than the story could possibly support.  With such a slow beginning, I think it's a good idea for the author to tell a little more about his world first before introducing the main characters.  Perhaps the most disappointing part of this book is that it ends before Anna has a chance to become a fully formed person.  After a solid first
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is good but the book is bad. It is very slow paced. The characters are not interesting. The narrator sounds like a 3 year old trying to imitate a 30 year old.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't usually do this, but I am so bored with the plot that I couldn't get into this book, and I've never had a problem with a book's plot and characters.   What was so wrong with this book is that it was so stupid and boring.  And I'm a sucker for a good "what if?" story, which this certainly was.  It all started with the story of someone getting hit by a truck, and the narrator was so bored, that he was just wandering around for the whole book.  When he finally found some action to do, he did it in a really weird way.  They took out a giant chunk of concrete, and then had the person walking on it be in the middle of a fire fight!  And they put that chunk of cement in the path of the fire, but then it just kept moving forward because no one was watching it!  Now, I know that it sounds ridiculous and pointless, but the whole story seemed like a bit of a waste of time.  But even more so, I think the author was just getting into character!  I can't even tell you the many times I had the most brilliant, clever thought while I was watching the movie version of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disappointment. A very poor example of a science fiction novel.   I read this book in an attempt to see if the same book was as disappointing as it sounded.  The characters are interesting and interesting people. The story is interesting but the story itself is very shallow.  It seems the author had some kind of agenda to make the book look good or make it more important or something.  I would love to read a book that was the same in story but actually interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a huge fan of the original trilogy, and in the end, just a huge douche.   His main character is named Jar Jar Binks, so I suppose that makes me a Jar Jar fan.  There is a whole scene where the two characters share a private bathroom, and he's doing his very best impression of Jar Jar.  In the original books, Binks and C-3PO were friends, so it's a bit of a stretch to assume that in this series they will end up as rivals.  It doesn't help that Binks is played by Adam Driver, who was born in the year 1983.  The book is written with an almost smug style of snarky wit, like a bad parody of The Daily Show.  It's obvious that the author knew the movie and the books.  Even in the novelization (which is not an accurate depiction of the movie) Han Solo is referred to as a "curious young man."  This book is not only terrible, it's also not really a Star Wars novel at all.  This is a terrible book, but that's not the point.  I actually really enjoy the book.  At first I was really excited to read a new novel, but I can't say I enjoyed it as much as the original Star Wars trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like to give a bad review because I feel like they should be good books but it is impossible to not like them but I think this is a bad novel by a bad author. The writing was awful in the beginning and it got worse and worse until I had to stop reading after just one chapter. I don`t know what I expected but this is what I got. The main characters is the one I really hate but the heroine is the most interesting I suppose. It just ended up making me feel so sad I don´t even know why I read it anymore. Maybe I will never read it again but I can´t help myself now I guess,  I don´ll give a star to the main characters and just 1/4 to the other characters but I really do not enjoy the book but that does not mean that I don't enjoy reading about the main one so that is a big help to me because the book has so many problems it makes me sad to read about the other people but the fact that this book was published for an unknown reason really messed it up for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a wonderful experience to read. The book really does what it set out to do well. The author was really creative.   My only complaint is that there weren't more scenes in the book. I had to stop reading at around half way through as I had no clue where to start next. I think that this is a problem with many paranormal romances as people don't get interested in the characters if they don't have many scenes with them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love books. I am an audiobook reader and love the sound of a good book.   The sound of the words of the book are beautiful and not too loud and annoying like the sound in some books from Audible. The stories of the different races and the different characters in this book are very well written.  Also I love how it is a mix of romance and fantasy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... the book sucks. I was expecting a bit more from a science fiction/fantasy book. It wasn't bad, but it was not something I was going to want to read over and over again either.  You're going to love me for this one!   This book is great!  I can definitely recommend it and it is a must read.  I am so happy that I found this book. I have been meaning to start reading this for a while now.   5 star Review.  This book is a fantastic read, I loved everything about it.  The only thing I think I'd change is the ending. I feel like they should have left a bit longer for the characters to connect and understand. I just felt it was a little too much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a great start to the story, but nothing more. The ending was terrible, and I didn't find any emotional connection in it, which is a big turn off for me. -June 4, 2015Crazy!  Reviewer: DontLookBack - favorite favorite favorite - February 19, 2015  Subject: Not a great book. I agree with many of the reviews here - I also thought it was a waste of time. Not one of the greatest of SF novels. The plot is good, but not great. The characters are bland and uninteresting - and the story is very one dimensional. I didn´t find any real love between the two lovers. The world building was decent, but at times could be a bit heavy - I like the idea of a race of people who look like children, but have been grown up from birth. I also liked the world-building in the last hundred pages, as it made me think, and even feel, that something is really missing in the story. I´m afraid it may be one of those books that doesn´t quite work - or at least not that I remember it well enough to recommend it to my friends. - February, 19, 20115. Not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is very confusing about the history of the world, the nature of man, the purpose of life and the various theories about the Universe, and the concept of the "Universal Life Force" which is supposedly at the center of everything.   I felt the author was trying to pull a few strings, but there were no surprises as to where the book is going to lead.  The conclusion is just a rehash of the concepts of the earlier books in the series that he's written, including some that were new to me.  I didn't think much about the character of the protagonist as he does very little to advance the plot.  I really liked this book, and would recommend it to anyone that is interested in the philosophy and science of life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that should not have been published. The author claims it is a historical novel. It is really an essay. And I am a history buff. I have read all the major historical novel ( The French Revolution, The Spanish Inquisition, A Man Without a Country, etc...) So I know there were good writers out there who got the facts wrong in their books. Well, the book does not get the facts right. I think the author just had a vision of what the French Revolution was about. He wanted to portray an idealization of the revolution. The book does a great job of portraying the chaos and violence. The problem is the author completely and intentionally omits a great deal of the actual facts about the revolution and the revolutionaries. What the author does not show you is the fact that France had no constitution or the rule of law in 1789. There was no law regulating the power of the French military. France had the most corrupt military of all the French governments. I found it amusing that the French troops had no clothing in the army. They went from the mud to the cold to the snow without having anything to protect them from the cold. The soldiers were so filthy in the winter, that the men started to wear mittens to cover their hands. They had to be shaven by their officers. The men were so hungry that they ate anything they could get their hands on. The French government was so corrupt that a soldier even had to testify against his own commanders. The army was so over taxed that they were being paid half a year to a year for work that they should have been paid for by the government. The generals even wanted to raise the taxes. The Revolution was a complete disaster. If the authors had not completely omits all these facts, I would have been a little more impressed. But, they completely and purposely left out the history and the truth of the story to bring out what they wanted.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't get over how easy it is to write a book that you have never read.   The story is good but the author is a complete slob.  I read this book because I have been hearing about it for a while now and thought I should give it a try.  The author has a bad habit of talking too much, often out of the narrator's mouth.  It is hard to understand if you listen to him in real time.  While the narrator seems to be from a different culture, the story is not about a different people.  A lot of it is the story of the author's life experiences and their influence on him.  This is not a good read if you are looking for a good mystery or book about a person who has lived an extraordinary life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is written so poorly I could have done with a little better. The stories are so clichéd, as well as being incredibly long with a lot of the characters being really stupid. The characters are so unrealistic I could hardly care about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book that doesn't have much impact, I was expecting more from the guy who's writing on this subject. His words aren't in my mind (my favorite kind of words - the ones I can't remember) and I don't really know what he's going for. This was just a long-winded, uninteresting book about an ancient civilization that was really just a fancy way of saying that the Romans were a bunch of assholes who just happened to be the rulers of Rome for a short time. If this sounds stupid, I don´t blame you.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am disappointed that this book was the last one I will ever get into, and that I may never read any more.   I have read many books by this author, and although they have not been particularly great, I am willing to give a bad novel a bad review, but I'm going to give it one for being a really bad novel. The author seems to think that he can write a book where a man is a hero, while an ugly woman is the villain, and the book ends with a happy ending, in spite of the fact that the main character has never forgiven himself for trying to be a good man and have a nice family, instead, the protagonist has been completely destroyed by his actions.  It is the main reason he is so miserable and bitter in the first place, because he never could have been a good father.  The story revolves around his character's daughter, who is very beautiful and intelligent, but is also very angry and bitter about the whole affair, and her parents for not loving her.    I never found this really convincing at all.  Even though the main man has a good relationship with the parents, the author completely mismanages this relationship by making the parents be a terrible mother and father, and a very evil mother and a evil father.   The fact that she never knew her father in her childhood (while she was supposed to know her mother, which made her angry at her parents) means that she had no idea she was being manipulated by her parents.  It was all about the man, and he never seemed to give any thought about the daughter, and I had this strange feeling that the whole time the book was going to end, there was another book in the works by the author that would resolve this issue, and all the characters would get together at the end, but instead, all they did was make her angry.  I wish I could have stopped reading the book at that point, but no, the main problem I had with this novel was the fact she was a woman and she was not a good mother.   She was too much about the bad guy and never about the main love interest in the book, who just wanted a nice life and a good family.   There were several reasons to kill her in the end (he was really good at playing the game and the bad thing was that she was too good at it, so he killed her as a result), but this made
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I gave this book two stars is because I did get a little bit tired by the end. After reading a couple chapters, I was ready to put this book down, but it didn't. The story was boring, the characters were bland, the writing was sloppy. But the story did have a good ending. But I wouldn't recommend this book for the story alone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to get this book but sadly it didn't live up to my expectations. There was way too much filler in the book with nothing to really add to the story. There is so much pointless content that it is pointless to even get through. And the main story is just a bit boring. I would just recommend this book for people who just want to read a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry, I have to say this book was a disappointment. There is a lot of hype about the book. For starters, it is written in the form of a short story with the addition of a foreword by the author. A foreword is a way to explain how a book will be used in a series. Unfortunately, the foreword was written so poorly I was confused by what the author was trying to convey. The first part is pretty much the same as the other stories that he has written and it does not seem to be a response to any particular book. Instead, he is attempting to tell a long story that has already been told several times before. The writing was not bad but the whole book seemed pretty uninspired to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        This is an awful book that I'll never read again.   If I ever have a bad read I will probably hate it, but this was horrible and boring.  The author, a woman, has a lot of problems and issues she has with herself and with others in this book.  It's not the worst novel she's written, but it's the worst I've read by her.  Her characters are shallow and uninteresting and her plot is pretty much just a bunch of one-note villains and/or side characters.  I have never read anything that has made me as unhappy to read as this book did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book because I have been interested in the science of consciousness. This is a bad science book, with no real evidence for consciousness. I think the first problem with it is that it doesn't present any convincing evidence for its thesis, which is that consciousness is a special, biological property and that the very notion of consciousness, and even the word itself, is a recent invention, one that must be explained because no other species has consciousness (though we would recognize it if we saw it). Instead it proposes the notion that "consciousness" is a "universal" or a "linguistic" property of all living systems, from amoebas to humans. The "lingucid" term implies a linguistic structure that is not present in biological entities (for example, the word "meow" has no logical meaning). This is especially weak evidence that we are dealing with a "basic" property that all living things have, since there are plenty of animals that do not have "conscious" experience (some of which would be considered alive). So I guess we must conclude that consciousness in non-living objects is a result of artificial selection. And the author goes so far as to say that it must be an evolutionary process that created consciousness in animals, since humans have it too! That's one more reason why consciousness should be regarded as a special biological property. If it is a mere evolutionary "feature" then it is subject to selection pressures that might change its expression (e.g., perhaps not in animals). But there is nothing to indicate that it evolved a lot in humans, which are by and large the most intelligent species on the planet. And then there is the whole thing about language being a recent idea, invented by people who apparently didn't even know what language was (the concept was invented by Aristotle). Aha! Now consciousness is not an original idea but a cultural one! That is, language is an invention of the modern day, and only the modernists invented it! But I don't see how consciousness is any more "alien" to humans than the other properties of non-human animals (e the smell of a cat or of a pungent odor in a room), and I see that the author does not really have anything better to say than that consciousness has nothing to do with language. So I won't bother with the rest of the book, and won't say anything more about it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad   Very confusing   Not for the first time I bought it but it's one of those books that I just won't read. The author describes the world of a city and the inhabitants and then describes how the "world" is made and it's just a horrible world that is completely incompatible with the city. They even describe the "darkness" (I think?) of the city, which is described in a totally different way than what it is and seems to me that the author just made up the "unnaturalness" and "dark" stuff to make the city seem a bit more real. The people have no character and the city is not a "dark place", it's a "normal" city. So, I guess you'd say it's an "unrealistic" story or a "weird" story. The city is so weird and unworldly.   I think this is not what I expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I am not a historian, but I am an expert on the Holocaust. The book is about a little known, forgotten, and often misinterpreted aspect of the Holocaust - the 'concentration camps'. The Holocaust is about the deliberate murder of millions of Jews by other Jews, and the Holocaust is not a moral judgment but an historical one. The "concentrator" who planned, orchestrated, and executed the Holocaust was an official in the SS. This SS official is, however, the only person that ever gets convicted of the crime. The rest of the Nazi leadership escaped justice and were not tried at all. We know this from the diary of a former SS man called "Eichmann." I think the book, while very good, is not very convincing on the basis that it focuses so much on the individual Nazi functionaries. It is also not very clear about how the concentration camps were run and who in the Nazi hierarchy ordered the killing."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book 5 stars, and I gave it 5 stars because it was a very good book.    At the very least, it was well written (the prose is great, but more on that later), it had a few good ideas (in my opinion, not necessarily positive ones), and the characters were engaging, well-rounded, and well-developed.  The problem, in my opinion though, is that all the good ideas, the one or two that were good, were also very poorly implemented.  For a first book, this could be the case.  But unfortunately, the main character, who is meant to be a "nice" guy, is a monster.  He is a bad person in almost every way.  At every turn he is a "villain".  He rapes people. He murders people.  His motivation in life, in some ways, is hate.  And while it isn't as bad as the villains in the horror movies (like a killer who only kills those who deserve it), it still is pretty horrible.  So in terms of "evil", this was the worst.  After you have finished the book (which I recommend to read in one sitting, so that you get the idea of the story) and you see all the horrors he's subjected to, it's pretty easy to see why I wouldn't give this book a 3.5.  My main issue is that there are a few characters that should've been eliminated.  In my opinion there were a few things that I would've done differently if I'd written the sequel (which would have had a much happier ending).  As for what I liked, it seemed like the book could've been much better, but I'll leave the review at that for now.  All I'll say is that I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good horror story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle as part of a summer job that I had at the library. This book was a great read. I enjoyed the book and the characters, and there are some good moments. It's a little short though and it might have been better if I read it in a shorter book format. I don't know if it's just me, but the stories always seem to have a bit of a "waste of time" feel to them. I understand this is the author's attempt to keep things short, but I found it too confusing and not very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of two or three short stories, and the characters were all created out of whole cloth, without any sort of background to go by. The one that got me was about a "garden gnome" who had a magical pet dragon and a girlfriend who "lived" with him, and one scene ended with a bunch of the characters eating a dragon and being blown up. I also found this book's title to be the most confusing and irritating:    A garden gnome's love for a pet dragon.    My first two experiences with the title had been very positive, but it's clear that this book will not find a place on my shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm writing to say that I have no problem with this book. I enjoyed it! I think the biggest problem was that I got so caught up in the plot that I forgot to really enjoy the book overall. I thought it was fun and a lot of fun to read, but I felt I would have preferred to read a different book. This story has some problems with the pacing and the structure. The first part is great, I don't think the book is bad overall. It just took me out of the book before I really got involved. Maybe that is my fault and not the author's. He said the ending was going to be weird so I guess it just turned out that way. The second part of the story I had a problem with. It didn't go in a direction I was expecting it to go in so I ended up feeling like the story wasn't that interesting. So that was the only thing that really took me away from the book. If I would of been better prepared for the story then I would probably have enjoyed it more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is not interesting enough.   I expected a bit more from the author.  They seem to be missing something and this is the result.  I didn't have the guts to read this book by the author I have the urge to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *   The whole story is really bad. I don't even understand why anyone would read this book. It is completely predictable with no surprises or anything.   There is no sense that the characters are trying to accomplish anything, or that they care about the outcome.  What I did get out of the book was that the main character had a relationship with a woman who was very "sad." He didn't have a real girlfriend until the book started to turn towards the end of the first half.  I don\'t think that it was the end result of the relationship that I didn't care for. The characters were also so one-dimensional I felt like they didn\'t have any real personality. I am not one for the whole romance/hilarity/heartthrob thing that a lot of romance novels have, but it wasn\'t there in this one.  It is just so one sided.  The ending was really bad too.  "What? I don'\ve ever done something that stupid. And I\'ve done so much stupid in my life. And that\'s a lot."   It had just turned into a normal romance book, with the main characters being very loving and caring towards each other (for a while I thought they were a couple).  Then things started to get weird.  They fell in love for almost the entire book but it always seemed like it was just some random person that they met and that they weren\'t ready for that they didn't even know was a person. They fell for each other but the woman had no real reason to want to do anything other than just meet him and be his girlfriend for the rest of his life.  At the end he decided to run away, she had no idea how to respond because she had never had a boyfriend and she wanted the man that had been so kind and wonderful for her to still be a part of her life. In the end the main two characters realized that the woman who they had fallen in love with was not real and didn\'re even interested in them as a person but as just someone to be with for the remainder of his days.  A lot of the romance in this book had a lot to do with the fact that it wasn't realistic, which doesn\'t make the book bad.  But the fact still remains that the book has been written so poorly and is a really poorly written book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible read   This book needs to be banned. The author, the publisher, the school district, all have to take a step back and review what has happened. The only positive thing I can say about the book is that it is interesting reading about a new student coming to the school and finding it very different. But the school can still do more to protect the children that are in their care. I felt that the author of the book was a very disrespectful person and the book needs review for such. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this to read after reading a bunch of good books.  The first few pages are very easy to follow, but then it starts to get hard. I know the authors tried to make this a thriller, but the last 2 or 3 pages were confusing and had me frustrated. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes a thriller.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is probably one of my least favorite stories, but it has a great ending. I thought that it was really interesting to see a man not being able to control his emotions towards his family and his wife, and what it feels like to see the pain that your family goes through.   (hide spoiler)  The story starts with a beautiful story of love and loss. She is having trouble falling in love, because she is not feeling that the other person is enough for her. He is in his 30s, he is an intelligent man, and he has a nice job. She feels a bit bad that she has to make the sacrifice, because they are so compatible. It turns out that they are not compatible. She wants someone with whom she can share her life as she sees fit. She has seen his family, and she loves the woman with whom he shares her life. They have kids and do not have a lot in common. They even share the same birthday, which is a little odd to her. This is not all that bad a relationship, she is actually pretty good looking, and their child is quite adorable. However, after a few months, she finds out that the man does not want a child at all. He wants his life to be as he wants it to be, and that is something that he wants for himself. He does not care about his wife or his son, or anyone else. She goes to the authorities about what is going on, and this is where the story gets really interesting. The woman, despite being told her man is an emotionally unstable person, is able to work with the authorities. This makes me like this woman so much more. It really shows the lengths that she will go to find a place for herself. She does this because she cares about her son, and the man who has abandoned her. I really like that she cares for her family, she does not have the same problems that her husband does. I also really like the whole "I can't even look in the eyes of my son, why does he love you?" part of the story, especially because it is written so well. The ending is good, it is sad, but I think it is worth it because it shows a lot of character growth from the beginning of the book to the end. I give this book a 6/10.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a rip-off! So much that the "book" of all books, it's pretty bad. The writing was pretty bad, so I was a bit disappointed. So, I gave it a negative rating, because it was not what I expected. But I still will buy this "book", but not this "Book", because of its low ratings. The book has a lot of pictures. The author said that it will be in the middle of the night, in the back. But there's no book, so what kind of person would read it? The author says that he knows a lot about the religion and a lot more than you do, that's why he can write a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One word summary:  For those of us who have tried to be better and be more open to our own perceptions and reactions, this book may come as a relief.  The author is aware of this issue and she does a good job of recognizing that it's common, to the point that she offers a kind of self-help guide for readers who may be trying to deal with it.  It's certainly a useful book in that regard.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is weak.    It's like a high school romance with the main character being a lesbian.  This is a book that just does not have any interest in anything but sex, even when the main story arc is about a girl with an STD. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really hard to read   The author, R.C. Bray has done a great job of explaining his theories, but he is so lacking in imagination that I am forced to find a good novel to get some inspiration.   I think I am going to have to read a book that is at least as good as this one  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read only a few of the many books in the series, I did not enjoy the book very much and I think I will not pick it up again. I found a lot of inaccuracies in the book and the main character is a poor character. She is very childish. I don't think the main characters in the books are very interesting or unique. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My kids started reading this book because my husband started asking me to get the book for him. We're both reading now and I must say, I'm a little disappointed. My husband is really enjoying the book and I haven't really been able to focus on the book since the first chapter was a little slow.   I've heard some positive things about this book, but not my experience with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this because I was very excited about it.   I didn't like it very much.  It was boring and the characters were uninteresting.  The main character and a few other characters don't have a lot going for them.  Their problems aren't very interesting.  I will not be purchasing it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "You are given the choice of reading a lot of boring stuff, or you can go out on a limb and read one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read." --Baron of the Night http://www.readreviews.com/review/3109/fantasy/chapel-hill-b...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, it took a few tries to get it just right. The first half of the book seemed like a really good read, and then I came to the ending, and it just didn't seem quite right to me. I was surprised to find the ending so ambiguous.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read, no offense to the author, I just felt like this was a terrible book.   In addition to all the bad reviews, I am disappointed in the fact that this book wasn't reviewed at the time it was published, if I am reading this book when I finally do, I will read the first few chapters of it and then just give it a bad review.  If you want to be a bad writer, this book should be the first to go under your belt.  It's like the author read the book and decided to change the ending so they had an even worse ending. The characters have no lives outside of the story, and there is no depth to their personalities.  They don't know who they are, what they are like, or who they were before they lost their memories. There are no words to describe how awful this book is, the characters are all flat, boring and the author tries to make his characters likable so that he can sell more books by having them go to war with each other.  All the characters end up dying in the end of the book, this makes the book seem even worse.  This book had nothing to do with the previous ones.  I will give it one star because it's a shame to not enjoy the story more if you already liked it, but I just can't recommend it. I hope the author will start reading about different types of people instead of only bad types of person and make a good story that the reader will enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book. It's not the best, not the worst, but it's not really bad either. And, I still haven't finished it. I can't even remember all the reasons I liked it. The most important reason is that it is about the first year of the Great Depression. This book is an American classic. The title is an allusion to the fact that we live in a post-war era. It captures our sense of loss of hope and possibility and loss of purpose. The second reason is the personal connection of the story. The Great Depression is still a very powerful symbol of the horrors that befell the American people and the world during this time. The third and most important is that the story of Joe the Plumber is one of personal heroism and determination. We all need heroes, even if they are fictional.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I found wrong with this book is the end which ends too abruptly and you have no more to say but that's because you haven't finished reading it.   A very well-written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     A good read, but I found it hard to follow. The chapters start out exciting, but by the end, the excitement turns to confusion and boredom. The author explains a little about the universe, but not enough to make it worthwhile.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I felt that this book was bad. I found myself wanting to tear this book in half, and I hate that. A lot of people seem to think that the book is really good, and that is a great compliment, and it's one of my favorite books. However, it really didn't feel like a part of a good series. The characters were bland. The plot was not well thought out. The writing was okay, but I don't know that it was amazing. My only hope is that the author writes another book in the series and it will turn out better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book with the words "bad" and "bad writing" in the same sentence and no way for me to know if these are just the reviewer's own personal opinion or if it's actually bad writing.   I'm an English major and have read a few novels, including a few from "literary fiction", but nothing I have read has felt quite as "unwritten" to me. I'm just not a huge fan of books that start with a description of what the characters are about to do, how they're about to go about doing it, and then the characters doing it. Usually, it's because there are too many characters in the first place, but not in this book. Every character has some degree of agency. You have the "hero", the "evil person", the one being saved by the heroes, the one the hero really hates, the annoying friend, the "good person", who's just trying to find the best thing in the world, the boss who's been taken advantage of by his own people, the mysterious person in the background, the girl the hero has a crush on, the rival, the kid that's being pushed around by the bad person, and the girl who might be falling for the hero.   The plot is about all of them, but only a couple actually have anything going on that doesn't revolve around them.   There's some good parts, like the evil people getting captured and being interrogated. But a lot of the time I felt they were just being made up for dramatic purposes and the plot simply doesn't add up. The heroes' intentions seem to change often. I would like to have seen more from the girl/boy, the bad guy, the bosses, the villains, the enemies, the boy/girl, the antagonist, the sister, the friend, etc. They seem to be given a few hours, but they have almost no time to do anything at all. I was thinking that there must be a more believable reason for the girls and boys to be separated. Maybe they had something to say but the words weren't coming out right. Or maybe the bad guys just can't get anything out of these two.  I'll admit that I like to find reasons why characters do what they do, and this book definitely doesn't have any. It's just the usual "plot" plot where we learn about the evil person's scheme, then the plot kicks in, then it's
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book for a good book.   It's not a good idea to read anything by this author.  I'm sure the book would have been better if it was a different author and if this author had made some minor improvements in the prose or if the author had a better grasp of the science and had a more coherent plot.   Review by: Sibylle  Recommended by: I Love Books  Date Written: June 22, 2010  Overall Rating:  As a science-fiction reader, I often want a book that can't be easily dismissed as trash, but when this book falls short, it's downright embarrassing.   For science fiction fans, you know there is some science here and there; in some way, you feel as if you are part of the world that is depicted in the book. The setting is very accurate and accurate is a good way to describe the setting. But there is too much over-the-topness. Some of the characters are so obviously "bad" that it's like a slap in the face.   is a great book but it's hard to get beyond its shortcomings.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed in the quality of the writing in this book, and the fact that I had to wait so long to start it, and didn't get to read it before it was released.   This is a book which I'm sure I'll read again, but I'm not sure if I'll buy it.  Why I didn't like it:   The problem with this book was pretty much everything that bothered me in the first book.  It was pretty hard to believe that the plot could be written so quickly in a short amount of time, and even the romance in the second half of the book was not as well done as the first.  The pacing in this part of the series is pretty bad, and I also felt that this is really the only part of this book which could have been written in the 1970's.  However, the characters were well written and the main characters were all compelling, and as long as they were good enough, they were probably going to be quite popular.  I think that the best thing about this book is the characters.  And while I don't like them very much, I do like the characters, and think they were written well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's just not what I expected, but I have a feeling that some of the reviews have it all wrong: it's got a lot of depth, there are a few unexpected twists and turns and I'd say it's a very well done book, though there's a bit of a problem with some of its characters which I hope will be fixed in later books.   I think I'm going to enjoy this one, I don't see this as a 'bad' book, but a book that had a good idea that was executed rather badly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, let me say that this is a very good book.   I have not been bored by it.  I think it has a really interesting idea and it is well written.  It is very well put together and the characters are all really well developed. I found the book fascinating and the science behind it fascinating.  But the characters just didn't seem to add up to me.  In the beginning, I really liked them, I liked what was going on and I liked the science. But after about page 25, my interest had gone so I just stopped reading.  This is one of those books that is really easy to get into but hard to get out of.  The characters seemed to be too perfect at the start and then it seems that everything just fell off a cliff after a while.  So much so that I am going to have to read up on the book to figure out what is going on. I give it four stars because it is not bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is awful. I'm usually a huge fan of Stephen King but this book just does not belong in his oeuvre. I've already had to start over for my own edification from my copy of this book and it's very likely my copy was a copy that was already in circulation. This book has a lot of problems. First off, it's just not a good book. King has already written a very, very long book so it's disappointing to see his best work in a book this short. It's a very slow, dull read and is very confusing. I do understand why he would write it like this because that's what he does when writing his books, but it's definitely not the type of thing I'd like to read. King is so good at writing well structured characters and this one is nowhere close to that level. I don't know why King is trying to force the reader to have to go back and read this book because it just doesn't work. I mean what the hell is going on with Billy and his brother? There's a whole chapter devoted to them and then nothing happens for the rest of the book. Billy does what we've come to expect of Billy the villain but he's just a lazy, pompous, selfish, self-centered, hypocritical jerk. It feels like the author wanted to write a very good Billy, but the book just couldn't come together in the end. King doesn't make a good villain; he makes a bad one. The only reason to read this one for a villain is that you need someone to root for and to care about, but unfortunately, Billy doesn't feel like the person you should root for in the way you should care about someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a total crap and so boring.   I love science fiction and the genre itself, but this book is so poor in all aspects it's embarrassing.  It's boring to read, it's boring as hell to get through and it has no plot.  There's no character development.  In the end, this book was a waste of time, and not worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is very vague and illogical. In my opinion the characters were a waste of time. A man with a brain disorder, a woman who wants to be treated like a woman, a man who is trapped in his own body (the mind of a man) and a woman with a secret history all get together and the plot just kind of skips over them.   Overall this book was a little too weird and confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is boring.   It lacks the kind of character I think would appeal to readers interested in history or military history.  I was only slightly disappointed by the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's a reason the word "bad" doesn't appear in the description on Amazon.   My first impression of this was that it was a "rerun of the original" -- that is, a book which had been done quite a bit before and yet couldn't keep up.  It's not that these books have been done before, but the quality of the prose is always poor. It's just that the writers and their publishers have lost all sense of the concept of telling a story through the voice of a character.  This is the only book in my library that I've been compelled to keep reading and re-reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because I was interested in learning about the historical development of the Church in North America, and so far I've been disappointed. The history, as one might expect, is interesting; but the writing style is poor, with too much use of jargon.   My only point is that I would have been better off just learning about it from the church's own historical sources. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a novel about a woman who has the hots for a doctor, but she is forced to accept a husband when she falls in love with the doctor's brother (which she has no desire for). It's too bad that this novel doesn't go into any depth about either the doctor or her brother.   This novel was well-written, but it really didn't have any plot to speak of, nor did it have anything interesting going for it other than a bunch of women. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a great book, but I will not buy the sequel! This book had all the features to be a classic. But it's got a plot line that is so terrible it's nearly comical: The story of a young boy named T.J. whose sister has been kidnapped! After years of neglect, he goes looking for her and finds the family farm. After a brief and enjoyable encounter with a man who can talk to cows, T.T. and his friends end up in a situation in which they have to steal and kill cows in order to buy time to get help. It's a fun and entertaining read and is a good book for young kids. But what makes this book so horrible is the fact that there are two of these kids, T-J. and T-F. Both are in the same book but are not on the same page. Their situations are so similar that you end up wondering if T.F. or T. T. is more stupid and annoying, or if T-T. or a different T. really is stupid and obnoxious. The ending was very stupid as well, since T-t's sister has already been rescued and the book ends right after that. But that's about all I can say for the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a good read. Instead I got a bad read. I have read and bought books from several online retailers and have had them all be very good and enjoyable. This book was horrible. The narration is not bad but it is really bad. The stories are confusing and unenjoyable. If your expecting a great story read the book instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a really good book. I don't think it really needed to be that good. It's a really long book that's a compilation of stories that don't really do much with each other. It makes me wonder what people actually read to get these stories so they can put them in one book. It seems like a good idea to me. I only wish the stories were longer though, because it makes the book a lot more boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author does a good job of making you think, but the lack of logic and facts make the book an impossible read. If you are interested in the subject then it will be good fun. The problem with the book was that even though he explained the science behind the UFO phenomenon, he does not provide the details. This is a mistake made by many science fiction writers.   The story is very interesting in it's own right and well told by the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book suffers from a poor presentation by the author and a weak story. "   A very poor story. If you have read more than a few stories, you may be able to tell it's a story, but it has no actual plot, unless you count the author going "I don't know, the girl and the dog and the fish were talking, I guess."  In the first two parts of the story, the dog is trying to get some food, but she gets lost trying to find him. She falls down a cliff and the other dogs help her get back to where the food is. The author said he made the dog get the food, which was a nice touch, but really didn't help her. In the third part, the guy is at a rock concert and he gets to talk to a girl. He gets angry and wants to kill her, but he can't because he has a knife. So, the other guys try to kill him, but they can't.   At the end of the third section, the boy and the girl are on the back of a motorcycle, and he says that they were going to make it to the girl's house. Then, the author suddenly switches the story to a flashback to when the boy was little. Now, the point of that whole section was that they get there, and then the author goes "No, we don't, they did". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the third book of the series and I have not been very impressed. The story is interesting enough and it's interesting how the main character gets a hold of the weapon. Unfortunately the characters are not very interesting and have a few major issues.   First I have to say the author does a great job with the science fiction world. We have an advanced civilization that looks and feels like an advanced future world. It's definitely a place where it would be good to have a strong military to protect you from a potential alien invasion. However the world feels very flat and lifeless to me.  I was hoping to see a future that was a lot more interesting and thought the world would look different than it actually does. The alien civilization seems more interested in exploiting the world.  I am not a fan of this book but I do like the idea of the aliens invading earth and it would make for a good sci fi novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - This is a horrible book.   The story starts off great, but then you learn of the characters, who have very little going on.  - The writing is bad and repetitive and makes you feel like you're reading a bunch of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In summary:  What is the point in reading a book if it is boring and there are no good parts to it?   What a terrible story!   There is no good or interesting plot and just endless repetitiveness.   This book has nothing to do with the books listed in my other review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never had a book with so little enjoyment in it. I don't know if the book just didn't have much fun or the book was simply bad but it didn't do anything interesting to my enjoyment. I really didn't enjoy the book at all. Maybe next time I'll give this book a try but I highly doubt it will be a pleasant experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book to read for my daughter. I was happy to see that it was not a sex book about how to get a man in bed, but rather something more serious. The main character, the narrator, is a former journalist who is divorced and on the verge of financial ruin. When her son has been diagnosed with cancer, she finds herself drawn to a man she never expected to be her partner in a new business venture. This book is not for the faint of heart. It is difficult to get into, at least until the end. It's really a story of a couple, but it also covers the issues of men and women who have different needs and beliefs. I highly recommend this book for the women in your life, even if you're not looking for a relationship. It may take some time to get to know him, but he is a nice guy, and I'm sure that he'll be a better husband later on in the relationship than he was the first time around. The author is very open about her beliefs.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story follows the story of a girl who is trying to get revenge on her father. She's a pretty good fighter and a little bit of magic is involved, but the plot falls apart pretty quickly.   The story follows a girl named Rachel, who is living under the guise of a woman named Elizabeth, which seems a bit strange to me. I don't know if Rachel is actually a woman, or if Elizabeth was Rachel's mother. I never understood why the mother was the one Rachel is trying revenge on.  What would you say is the biggest weakness of the novel?   I'm glad to hear that you found the main character to be very strong.  The plot falls on hard times, not a surprise, and a lot of this book felt like a bit of a mess to me, especially considering how slow things were moving.  This isn't a great book for the first book in a series.  There are a lot more flaws to pick at. I'm also a little disappointed with how the plot unraveled, but then again, I'm not sure what to say about the plot in general, which isn't very interesting or original to me to begin with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is terrible.   It is about a boy named James and his little sister. James is a great student. He excels in all the subject he takes. His family is all very happy, and he has friends in school and in school sports. But James has a terrible temper and fights constantly with his little cousin.  When the two kids are kids they fight constantly and in the end, James kills his cousin. When the relatives go on a camping trip, they find that the camp is haunted by ghosts.  The writing is terrible in the first 20 pages.  Then, the next 50 pages are awful.  There are so many spelling errors and stupid puns, I was bored to tears.  I have been known to get a headache just thinking about it.  It's like a bad movie with bad writing.  So for a book with so many terrible things in it, I gave it 3 stars.   (reviewed the day of purchase)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book. There was not much plot to this book; it just consisted of the people in the house talking to each other, telling their stories, and not even much of a plot. The characters were pretty bland. The only thing I did enjoy in this book was the ending. It was a very good, but not completely satisfying ending. I think this book is better than the first one, but only marginally.    (review of free book)  Review by: Karen E. on May 19, 2011 :  This is a very interesting story that had me reading the whole book in one sitting. It is also very short, but still a solid book in the series.   I really like the style of this book, which is very much the same as that of the previous two books, but with a few differences. There are no more of the annoying "Honey, can I help you?" type characters in this one.   on top of that, we have a story in which the main character is not the hero.   the main hero, David, starts off very strong, and as the book goes on, becomes a bit annoying to follow. This doesn't bother me as much as the other two books because it has to be said; the characters are still good, though, and in the end, the reader can forgive the protagonist.  . I just hope there will be a third book, in the vein of this one, because it is the first book I really liked, but my favorite characters from the first two books will stay in my mind longer than that.  I am very disappointed with this book though. It's a fun story, but I felt like it could have been better.  for me, the story of "the family," of David, his mom and her husband and his step dad, was a lot more interesting than this story.   The ending could have done with a little more closure to make it feel a little bit more complete.   However, the characters themselves, and the book itself, are still very interesting. This book is still fun, a quick read and worth a read.  the only things I would change is if there was a little less "honey can you help me?" and a little "hope" for the main characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the worst book I have ever read by Stephen King. I read it through on the second day of a vacation and in between reading a million other books about horror and mystery and the supernatural and the weird. The first few minutes of this book made me stop reading because I thought it was just a really bad horror story or a really weak, predictable mystery novel. But as the story progressed I couldn't stop thinking that the author should have just dropped the idea of a horror story altogether. I would love to see a Stephen King/Stephen King novella about a girl and her dog going on a ghost hunting trip.   -J.R.R Tolkien was a better storyteller than Stephen King, and Tolkien had more style. -John Updike could write a better book than King. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a joke.   I'm a horror writer, so when I thought the story was a joke, I knew it was a waste of time.  I tried reading it to see if I had really lost my soul, but I'm still not sure I ever did.  It's an anthology of stories that don't have anything to do with horror.  But it's a fun anthology! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      You need to read it to know what it's about but the writing, which I found so awful and uninspired that I just walked away, made me want to vomit.  You can't really describe the writing style as 'boring'. You can call it 'filler' and that is accurate. You also can call the writing 'cheap'.  But no, in my opinion, the boring part is the characters, which are very generic, very uninteresting, and very, very annoying. In a book which tries to be historical and'realistic' about its subject matter, the writing just falls flat.  in particular, the main character's name, John Lott, is almost word-for-word from a previous author, Stephen D. Mumford, with one exception, the 'L' is changed to an 'R' in some instances. I had read about Mumford's character in the 1990s in a book about his famous'militia dispute' with the American right but I never paid attention to it.   I've read the whole book and I am absolutely sick and tired of the book's writing, so much so that I am now considering going back and buying the book from a used bookstore to get rid of it. I've read other books in the past which I thought were good but not this book. The main character is also obnoxious and very arrogant and seems to think he is a genius. His main flaw is that he's very good at something and has it all figured out. There were so many things that could have been improved, from the characters to the story, it was almost as if the author wrote a whole novel on the book, which is what I've always suspected about him, that he is writing a novel and not telling a real life story.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's like a bad movie that's actually worse than a bad one...The characters are too unlikable and the plot is poorly thought-out. I don't think there's any good parts about it at all. And this book was bad enough that it made me want to quit. It's just really boring. There's no fun to be had.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -I was very disappointed by the ending. The story really was pretty interesting for a while, then just died. This was not the first time I've had to read a book with this kind of ending. But when I thought about what had happened before, it was pretty hard to believe. If I had read this book as a kid, I probably wouldn't have liked it. It's a little like being in a bad movie when you're watching the opening sequence, only to realize you didn't really enjoy the movie and now have to deal with the movie's ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was by far the worst book I've ever bought! I got it from a local bookstore, and while I was waiting for it to ship I realized I was getting two books, and I just want one. I know that a lot of people enjoy the genre and this is just not for me. And I'm sorry to be harsh. It's just that I can't enjoy this book. I don't know what the hype was about, but the ending is a total mess and the book could never have been any better. If you don't want to read a book about a young woman trying to protect her town from a curse (and the curse is in the name), I don the book is perfect for you. If, however, you love fantasy, romance, action, mystery and adventure and want something new in your fantasy book library, then you should definitely consider this book, because this book is just a waste of time, and your money. 1 star for me as it is very disappointing, and a bad experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I don't recommend this book to anyone. It's a really lousy book. It just has no plot. All the characters are completely uninteresting. And the dialogue is all over the place."

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really had to look up 'Moby Dick' when I started the book. I love the book, but it's overlong, and even though the story is good, it feels like it's trying to cram in a lot of little things at once. I really loved the characters, and I liked the book a lot, but the story was just too much.     I also think I have to comment on the artwork of this book, because that's what really drew me in to it. There's a lot more to this book than meets the eye.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book. The author does a good job of making the characters interesting. She manages to pull in all the pieces to make this a satisfying book. I felt like the author was writing the story so that it would feel complete. Unfortunately, that's not the case. I could have finished the book a lot quicker if she had just gotten rid of a bunch of the unnecessary characters and added in more relevant details about the character's past.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I really enjoyed this book, but there were some flaws in it: 1) The author seems like a fan who wrote this book just to tell her friends, and it made it too personal to me. The tone of this book is a bit annoying to me since it makes me feel that she is so personally involved with this girl, and she talks about what she would have done with her in certain situations, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of telling the story. I guess the main flaw with the book is the fact that this is all that the author really knows about it, and is making it up as she goes along. The author also has a lot of trouble with grammar, which I find a bit ridiculous and I felt the lack of grammar and sentence structure in her writing made the book feel very amateur. This may just be me being a bit picky with my book reads, but I wish I was reading this for a class I am taking. I have a feeling this might be a good book to read for those who like mystery, but not for those of you who like to find the "truth" out.   Summary:  "After the disappearance of her parents, 11 year old Nancy was bullied and eventually took her own life, leaving behind a letter explaining what her mother had been planning for her. Years later, Nancy's brother and sister, and one of her childhood friends, find the letter."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My daughter has not only become a good reader, but a great reader.   She has read every book I have given her for review and she has even read two of the non-fiction books.  The books are very educational and fun to read to my daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to read this book but I had such a hard time reading it! It's kind of like a story with a girl in it and not a very interesting one! I felt like I was reading some chick lit book from the 80's or something. I really don't like the story but not the character. This book does not have much to offer me except for the main character and that's not much to look forward to at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never heard of this book, but thought I would give it a chance as the author of the book does a lot of good for the cause of science.   From what I understand, this book is a critique of a new theory, "Theories of Gravity".   But as the book says, "no matter how many times a theory is disproven, scientists continue to promote it as the only possible solution to the most pressing problems in the universe".  The author goes on to describe the new theory of gravity as a form of creationism.  He goes on about the fact that the creationists use the same reasoning and arguments used by scientists who have used the creation theory for thousands of years.  But even with this book I had to put it down because I found it so hard to follow.  It seems that there are so many different theories of gravity that the author has to come up with the right one to support his beliefs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't say I loved this book. I found it a little difficult to get through. But I found the characters more interesting and less irritating than I thought I would. I don't know if this is just because I don 't know much about the War of 1812 or whether I just thought it was a long, boring slog, but I thought the ending was stupid. I mean, sure, I'm all for characters making mistakes and growing as characters, but they didn't have to end up dead. Even worse, I didn't like how one of the characters kept saying the War had been over for the past two centuries, even after having just been born. I could have done without the story taking place on a ship after all!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good read, but the book has many problems, some of them quite serious. I would highly recommend the book to anyone with an interest in psychology, but I would not recommend it to someone that is interested in the paranormal and is interested specifically in psi.  6 of 8 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:     My mom was a great book keeper and book seller, but as a teenager I was never allowed to join her in the library to pick up the books she brought in.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read some books which are good but aren't great; I've also read some which are great but aren of very poor quality; and I've written a few which are pretty good but simply weren't what they were advertised to be (especially when one is writing a review for a book that a book reviewer has not yet read).   This is no exception.   The only way this book could be worse would be if the author had not written the prequel to this book and made it his own.  In a nutshell, this is a story about an alien who is looking to gain access to Earth in order to kill the aliens who made earth so nice for him. The first part is great, but the rest of the book is not, it is simply not up to the standard of what one expects of a good prequel.  My only real complaints would be that the aliens are basically "evil" in this book (and if anything they are more like anti-heroes in comparison to the alien from the previous book), and that the author makes it quite obvious that the main characters are not the protagonists (even if they are the main focus of the story). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself, is great, but it's only the beginning of a series that will only make me more and more dissatisfied with the entire genre. The series is about a boy who is in love with a boy, with his father's permission. They go off to be together, go to parties, and are completely open about their relationship. Then the father dies, and the boy takes a new step father, and they move in together. When the father gets upset about his son being with a different man, he decides to murder them both to cover it up, killing them both. The book was great. It's the beginning, so maybe it's not so great, however the book was fun to read. It was also a good plot device for this story to go on. But it was also pretty bad. The father, I thought, was pretty lame. The girl was annoying. The boy was a jerk. The plot was not original, and it's pretty predictable. I'm glad it's over, but I'm really surprised at the amount of people that love this book.  There's always a good reason to have a baby, and in this story that reason is to have your child "just like his father". I was really disappointed by the whole storyline, because the main thing I liked about it was the father's idea to have the baby. He's kind of like the father I have now. He goes to all the parties, has a lot of friends, and loves his daughter. I can kind of see where he would want a baby to be. I felt like it was a poor decision on the father`s part. And then the girl I feel like she is really a bad choice as well. But we'll see how I feel about her in the end, because it's a pretty fast, I'm not going to say fast-paced book. But I do understand why people loved it.   In summary:  1. A father and his daughter decide to have sex with a man and then he kills them both 2. The daughter then decides to have another one of her own. 3. The woman who has the other girl, takes her for some reason and then murders the father 4. The mother goes after the man. 5. The man kills the mother and his wife before shooting the man he shot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book very much. The story was a simple and straight forward one of a man and his dog (who he adopts) living in a town where the humans and animals are enemies. He meets a girl and becomes friends with her. They start to fall in love and they end up having to take care of an animal for a while. The best part about the story was the characters. The author did a great job creating a lot of characters in such a short time. One of the best parts about the author is the detail he gives in describing his characters.     The book had nothing for me, it was just average.  In general, I have a problem with stories like this.  One of them was so predictable I just wanted to skip over it. I was hoping I would see some insight into this guy's life, but I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst I have ever read.   It is extremely boring and tedious and repetitive and I can't take the time to get a real story out of it.  So I will just write a negative, boring review about how bad this book is. I hate this book. I am going to write my review as if I never got this book so I can show the people that don't know how bad a book can be: If you love "The Lord of the Rings" or "Lord of the Flies", this book will be interesting and fun.  There is an exciting and good fantasy setting.  However, this book does not come with much content and just a huge amount of dull content that is just repetitive and boring.  Also, the author is terrible.  His writing is awful and just boring. I can relate to what he says, but he just repeats himself and it makes it so I think it's because this book was rushed to the publisher and the author was tired and rushed to write this book that he doesn't have any idea what he is talking about, so he repeats himself over and over again.  I feel like I could have written a better review, but I just feel like he should have been paid more for his work.  All in all, I feel bad for this book and the authors because he made it worse and worse over time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was just terrible!   The author is trying to make a point about feminism and women in the military that doesn't really happen in the book and fails because she doesn't seem to understand how feminism and feminism can work.   She does say, however, that it's good to discuss the problems with military service and all this but doesn't say how they apply to what she has in mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am disappointed with this book. The main character is a bit too bland, the narrator is not convincing and the plot is very predictable. But, for all that, this is a fun story and if you can find it in the store (like I did!) you'll probably be satisfied with this collection.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book so bad, and then it made me hate it so much, that I have to keep my hate alive by writing a negative rating.   First of all, let me just say that this book is horrible and boring.  It's a book that starts out with an opening about the destruction of a meteorite and an alien invasion.  I thought that this would be a good opening because it would make the book more exciting, but as the book goes on, I became more and more bored with the story.  At one point in the book, we get a very short description about a group of people living in a shelter with a lot of radiation and a lot less food.  After about 10 pages, this is just a bunch of people talking about their food supply for a few minutes, followed by a brief description of the food supplies that would get them through a month or so.  This is pretty much the entire book.  While the plot is interesting, the characters are just terrible.  From the guy that is talking about his new house (his new house has only a couple feet of floor space) to the "scientist" that is the only one that seems to understand what is going on, everyone is so flat and boring that the whole book really sucked.  In the middle of the book a little boy and his dog go to the meteorite to find out how the meteor was made, but the meteor is in the middle on the ground and he is so disappointed and tired because he has been looking for a meteor for so long.  What really put me off was that I had actually read about a lot more than 10 minutes into the book. The book was not that great.  On a scale from 1 to 10, the book is a 7.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is another one of those books I did not understand at the beginning because I did NOT like the plot. The entire novel is about a father attempting to get his child to fall in love with him. But what happens is that the story twists and turns the entire book and you end up having to re-read it to figure out what's going on.   The entire story revolves around two characters, who are at odds with each other, and are constantly fighting.  To me, that is just as bad as having a good plot that is ruined by bad characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the main problem with this book is that it seems to be the writing that's the problem rather than the writing itself. In the first two thirds of the book, the main character is the sole voice on the page. She is a fairly intelligent woman who is a professional. She isn't perfect, she is also vulnerable. But by the end of the third third of the novel, it becomes clear that she is not a hero. She's a villain. In fact, I'm not sure there is any villain in this book. This book has a bad case of 'the male gaze'.   (hide spoiler) In the final third of this book I felt that the narrator had lost a little of her independence.  (view spoiler) I don't think I need to tell you that it is often difficult for a reader to understand a woman who's been conditioned by gender roles.   When I read about this woman I felt, "Why does she have to be this way? I don´t understand it!"  This is the biggest problem with many women's fiction. It is often hard for a woman to be her own person and not just follow the steps that society has set for her. I donít think she is entirely bad, but I do think there are many elements of this novel that can be seen as having a more'male' viewpoint than necessary. This is not to say that there aren't other important women characters in this novel. The characters with whom the main protagonist falls in love, I do feel she's somewhat limited in her choices.  But then there are other characters with a much more'realistic' viewpoint and I found the main female character hard to relate to.  (hide spoilers)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did like this book, and the concept was neat but the execution was pretty poor. I think there was a lot of plot holes, including the fact that the guys that are killed are all just killed on the same day. The rest of the book's plot was pretty good as well. I guess I liked the concept of being a monster but I had a lot more trouble with how the book made you think it was possible. I don't think this was bad for the $1 I paid for it, but I'd probably pass on this again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a really short book. The main plot, a romance with the same character in the same world, drags on way too long and ends up feeling more like a series of vignettes than an actual novel. As a result, the book is a little bland and the ending feels a bit rushed.   I would recommend it for lovers of sci-fi, but not for those who want a more solid plotline.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The book is divided into 4 chapters. Chapter 1:  1) "I have had a difficult relationship with the human race for most of my life." (The author is quoting a statement by Einstein)  2) "The human race has no greater enemy than that of the scientific method."  3) "It is possible to be intelligent without being good or even to be kind without being kind." (This chapter contains several contradictions) .  4) "In every conflict between the scientific world view and the old religious world view, which is still very much alive, it is the science that is right and the religion that is wrong." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book from the library to read but couldn't read all the way through. I know it was supposed to be about the war and all that but just the chapters about that I couldn't get through.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The thing I disliked about this book is it seems too obvious to be an inside joke, but it just isn't, and the author really shouldn't have written a book of this sort unless he wanted to get a laugh out of it.    For a book about the book, this book's a real downer.  It's really disappointing to read about someone with a terrible personality like Peter, as he basically just goes around destroying everyone's lives, even with the help of a friend like Mandy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was not fun to read this book. The story was good and I liked it, but there is nothing much new. Nothing that is not already out there. This book has more in common with the old school superhero stories, which are better, but still, I can't enjoy reading this anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucks. The main character is not one that should be loved and admired or feared; this is the kind of guy that makes a great joke but is otherwise not very likable. She has a bad attitude, is selfish and mean and she hates everybody. She hates herself and everyone else because she's a coward. She is also in a bad relationship that is just as bad. But the most disturbing part is that she is only 13-14 when she starts. And it gets even worse because she has a baby brother.   I felt sorry for her, it really is a horrible experience and she does not learn much from it and goes on to have more problems.  I was a bit disappointed with the end. I think I would have been happy with more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing and the pacing of this book just sucked. I mean this book was a waste of time, and the main plot doesn't go anywhere. At least the last two books I've read, the story got me excited, but this book didn't have me, so I don't know if I'd recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not give you the information you need, and there is too much filler, especially for a novel.   That is probably the author's fault, but the lack of info is especially annoying with the fact that there is already so much info for this book.   It's one of the worst books I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After finishing this book I was not satisfied. The ending is what really annoyed me as it really feels like something was left to be desired.   The writing is very generic.  - - The Good:      This is a solid, yet unique story.  It deals with a number of themes including identity, trust and trustworthiness.  The ending was unexpected and is very different than the rest of the book.  There were a lot of interesting and relevant concepts which the author managed to wrap up nicely.  This book is worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a big fan of George R. R. Martin.   But this one didn't work for me.  "The man who had the most power over me... was not one of my parents or my teachers, but a man whose name I would not even dare utter."   And you may wonder why I didn't like it?   Well, I liked "Bastards" better.  One of the best parts of this book was the romance between Daario and Tyrion.  When Daario was in the Red Keep (where Daenerys was being held captive by Dany) I was thrilled.  Then the next time we see him, he is in the Iron Islands.  Why is he in the middle of nowhere, with Dany's army?  It just seemed too contrived.  At the beginning of the book, we are told, Daario has been on the road with Daenerra for two years.  Daenerrio is an experienced warrior.  In "Baldy" he is described as having "been a champion in his day."  When you first meet Daario, we don't learn how he got from Casterly Rock to the Iron Isles.  His only connection to the mainland is his uncle's ship that he rescued from the sea.  I thought it was kind of stupid that he had to travel such a long distance just to get to Dany and the dragons.  He was supposed to be the only person that Dany had heard of besides Viserys.  Maybe that's why Dany felt she couldn't trust him?  A little too much detail is given about the war that was going on and the fact that a Dothraki army was on the march.  There is a reason we don' t hear about it anymore.   It was just too obvious and too obvious to go over again.  A bit of the plotline is told in the flashbacks, but it seems that the entire story was pieced together just for the plot.  That's the only way to do it.  All in all, it seems the book could have been done better, but the romance was the reason I liked it.   I'm looking forward to reading the next book, "Blackwater."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's like you got the same book every single year and didn't read it until you got a chance to read the new one.   I'd probably put it in the "not recommended" section if not for the nice cover art.   The Review :  If you've ever been interested in a good sci-fi thriller, then I think you should read this book. I was a little skeptical at first since I had read the short story about the same characters (or parts of the same story) as The Fifth Season and thought it was a bit silly. I actually did enjoy The Fifth Seasons more though as it wasn't as silly.   This book is set about one hundred years before the events in The Fifth Series. We have some sort of an interstellar war going on with the enemy on the other side of the galaxy. The story begins with a young woman (who is a bit of a whore) being married and having sex with a man for the first time. She is trying to help him find a new home for his family when he is accidentally drawn back to his homeworld and ends up on the front lines of a massive invasion. This is where the story starts to get interesting, because you get a lot of different perspectives to see the different sides to the war. The female character has an extremely hot and sexy boyfriend (who happens to be an alien). The men on the enemy side are shown as having a lot more emotion (as the book begins), yet they're also shown as the good guys that should help out the good women (the men).   I found the story to be really interesting, although not all the characters were completely fleshed out. The romance between the two main characters was also a little cheesy. The characters were all rather different with some not being fully developed yet others having a full and interesting back story. The villain seemed to be kind of a jerk and didn;t seem to really care about anything other than conquering the galaxy or trying to get his lover back.  ... Overall a good story with some really cool science fiction elements.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started this book with high hopes, but the characters in this book did not live up to my expectations.   These characters were written in a way that was completely unbelievable.  When I read about this book, it made me think that the author was a complete nut and that this was the work of a completely demented mind.  I mean I get that they wanted to depict a true story but it doesn't work with this book.  This story was a disaster, and the author should have died in prison.  The last 10% or so of the book was fun, but that was it, and I would not recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is too long. Not worth the time.  I'm a writer.   I like to read.  I enjoy historical fiction.  This is good for history buffs, I would say.   The authors are clearly very talented.  They can make history fun.  But, at the same time, it is so long and complex and takes up a good portion of the book to get to the point.  What I liked about the book was that I could relate to the main character and feel what he was going through.  Unfortunately, I feel I could have done more to understand the world and why they had done what they did.  Overall, I enjoyed it, but it was just a little too long for a "historical fiction".
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the first ten pages, I felt that this book could be a masterpiece. Then the plot twists and cliffhangers take me completely by surprise.   The prose is beautiful, the world-building is excellent and the plot is gripping.  .  I had to stop reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed by this book.   The only thing I have to say about it is that it was one of the most boring and confusing books I've ever read.  I wanted to enjoy the story and see where it would go.  The book is about a teenage boy who is an expert in a computer virus and an expert at killing things.  He has created and programmed a computer program which he has set in motion.  And now he's killing everything and making himself the center of the universe.  After he makes himself immortal he's going to wipe the world's population off the face of the earth.  This is some very dark stuff.  It would be a good idea to make a sequel to this and to tell the story of a little girl who was abducted by the boy and who ended up becoming his wife.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book isn't bad, but it's so bad, so boring, so unoriginal and so completely lacking in imagination it's nearly as offensive as the author's bizarre and bizarrely misguided opinions on everything from the death penalty to religion. As a woman who had never read a book in her life, I was initially delighted at the novel's premise, but when I began to actually read it I soon realized it wasn't anything to write home about.  "The most boring part of it was this guy's wife. I don't know why he married her."  (p. 14)  I hate to be a wet blanket, but, really, the author is in a bit of trouble here. This is one of those books where the author claims the book is a work of fantasy, but the entire premise is laughable. The main character, who happens to be the main character of one of his favorite TV shows, has a weird love affair with a young woman from his past who happens never to have seen a movie, a show, or any other entertainment media since childhood, yet the relationship takes place over a period of years that no one even remembers, except for the two of them. The only connection between them is that they're both from a fantasy-based time period. The author claims that the entire relationship has to do with finding the magic keys to travel through the magical realms to help him fulfill a prophecy, but that's a pretty weak excuse. The other main character is a boy from the same time period who's also involved in the relationship. The two don't meet until a couple of hundred pages in, yet this is the first thing the author tries to sell us. There's nothing wrong with a love triangle between two male characters, but to be honest I had a hard time believing this book was actually set in a time period that he knew about, or that it even had a plot line or even was written in fantasy. The idea that this "tradition" is something unique or even special to one small corner of the world is a total stretch, but then that's really the only reason you'd want to read this book in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book. It was the first book in a trilogy.  I like that the author does not try to sugar coat it, but tells it like it is. However, it is a bit of a let down.  It does a good job at putting the characters in an environment that makes them feel like real people who are struggling in a real way.   It also deals with a very sensitive topic, and deals with it in a fair way. However the ending is a little abrupt. The ending does show what some of the characters are going through. But, the last sentence that follows it was not something I expected. It makes me wonder if they really are trying to be realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had read this book when I was in the fourth grade, but I never remember this book being on my reading list. I'm not saying it's a bad, but there were times when I didn't remember what happened in the book.   If you are looking for something easy to read, you should go somewhere else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've always liked the series so when this book came out I was excited. Well there's just a bit too much magic in this one! I know it's a book about the paranormal but I find it hard to believe that all of these guys are just the paranormal version of a rockstar. The only good thing is the book itself is written very well, it's about 80 pages and I couldn't put the book down.   Overall, I think the series is good for people who like paranormal, weird fiction and a little bit of romance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't believe there's a better book than this one. I was disappointed that it had to be split up into two parts for the audiobook, however that is a problem I have with almost all modern fantasy novels. I like the idea that a wizard can be someone of other races or classes, although some characters in the story seemed to have been written with stereotypes in mind. If you are looking for a nice story that is written with a good story-telling voice, look no further than these books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was boring as all heck!   The idea for a book about a character that is a little bit of a jerk is cool, but this book got there.   It's like the protagonist is not a jerk at all. I liked the way he kept his cool.  He acted like an alpha male in his relationships with women, but the way that he talks about the women is not cool. The way he talks in his book is like he's having a hard time saying things because he's trying to maintain the image that he's an alpha.    That's the only problem with the book, there's nothing really interesting about this guy.  I'll have to reread this to see if there is any deeper message, but I don't see what he is trying to do, other than trying to act like an Alpha male. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book wasn't bad, but just not for me.   The book's story is interesting and not entirely original.  While the characters are interesting, the characters of the book, particularly the main character are just bland and forgettable.  At times the story just seemed like a way to make money off the fact that a group of people with no real skills, but a lot of money, can manage to make a book popular and sell millions of copies.  But if you're looking for a good book to read, you won't find a better book than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really had no idea what to expect when I picked this one up. When I finally got into the book, I got a bit too attached to its character. I don't know why. I got sucked in, just like that. The story is rather long, so it was really easy to get immersed in the story. I'm sorry if the author was trying to write a psychological thriller - but I just didn't think he did it well. He just missed the mark completely. I loved the main character. She was cool, mysterious and strong. She had her own agenda, but I think that would have been better if she just acted like an average person. I also think that the story could have been a bit shorter (and this book could have easily been one volume). I think I read every page of it before I finished. But all in all, I really enjoyed the story and read it for fun. For this book, you get: a strong main character, a plot that is easy to follow, and lots of suspense. The book starts off pretty slow - but this is part of the charm. But as it progresses, it becomes more exciting. The story: the main protagonist has a problem and needs to find a solution. Unfortunately, the problem is the most important thing for her and it drives her crazy! When she finally comes to an understanding, things begin to make sense and she finally gets to sleep. But in her dreams she keeps seeing the same thing: the same person. Finally, she can accept the situation and stop trying to solve the problem. She just has to move on. That is the main premise. But the plot is just so much too complicated for this. The author tries to keep the story interesting and suspenseful at the same time. Unfortunately it just didn"t work for me. If you want to enjoy a psychological suspense/thriller with some psychological twists, then I guess this would be a good book to start with. But I just couldn't keep this story entertained.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The second book in the series is a pretty good fantasy.   It was the last book written by the author before she passed away.  Some of the characters in this book are a little flat.  However, I think that the fantasy elements help to make the book enjoyable.  I recommend it if you are a fan of fantasy and are looking for a new book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The story itself is a great story. It begins with a lot of information that's important to understand the story but then becomes a really boring set-up as the story goes from one plotline to another. The plot is nothing special and takes a while to build up, but I didn't feel like it was wasted. It seemed more like a nice introduction to the world that's being explored, and I'll probably look into the book more because I want to know how this story ends.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to love this book, and I read it at least four times before finishing. The story revolves around a girl named Sam, who was kidnapped at a young age. Her parents never let her go to school, and she has to fend for herself in her neighborhood, using her knowledge of the neighborhood and the animals to take care of herself. When Sam turns eighteen, she discovers that her father is a doctor. Sam is extremely happy that her parents will be away from her and she can concentrate on going to college. Things start to change when the school's headmaster, Mr. Oates, begins to show her behavior that is not in keeping with her parents' wishes, so she decides to run away. However, she ends up back at home, and has to figure out what to do with herself. A few things about the book bothered me:  The book really should have ended with Sam running away, since that would be the only reason for her to be at home.  The part of the book where Sam runs away was very boring, because you didn't feel anything towards her or her situation.  I feel like the story should have just ended at that point.  One of the most annoying things about this book was the idea that she was a runaway:  She was never really mentioned as a runaway, although her parents were.  Sam doesn't realize that she is running away until she is about twenty-two. This is the problem with most books that start with the premise of a girl being runaway, because the author doesn't want to get away from the idea of a runaway girl.  Even though Sam is running, she can't escape the fact that the person that kidnapped her was also a teacher.  To be honest, I don't think that the concept of a woman being a runaway and running away was that interesting.  In addition, the main character doesn't really go through many changes in the story as well.  This isn't to say that the book is bad. It's just that it didn't make me feel any differently about the main characters than I would have if the main female character hadn't run away in the first place.  There are also two things about Sam that really bother me.  First, when she is at her house, she is so self-important that she thinks it is a good idea to tell her father that she didn't love him, because he had been such a good father. I
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book.   In all fairness, you don't need to be a doctor to read about how a man who has been a successful entrepreneur, who has built a company of his own in China, and who has written multiple bestseller books is now bankrupt.  And there is a good deal about his life, his children, and his divorce in this book. (He is still very much alive, but I'm guessing he's not well enough to get a book contract these days.)  There are a couple of typos and typos that you probably noticed in the text (although I would expect this from a medical textbook), but otherwise the book is great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this because I knew I'd love it but this didn't live up to my expectations.  The first few chapters are awesome, the story line is so well paced.  They're so good that I'm glad I bought it.  I love the characters and their back story but the plot is dull, very predictable, and doesn't move the plot forward, it just sort of slows down.  My only other complaint is that the book is really long, it's about 400 pages and I had to skip a few parts as I didn't want to keep reading a book I couldn't finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book. The plot is great! I loved the fact that the main character was a girl, and I loved that she was a tomboy, but the romance wasn't there. I had a lot of fun reading this book, but I really wish that the romance was there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been trying to find the last book by Mark Lawrence to give it a fair review. While not a book I'll give 5 stars to, I do think it is one of the best of the many books he has written, and that it deserves to be read. I think he has a good grasp of the social issues he's discussing (like the fact that women are often the sexual objects of war) and while he doesn't always succeed in his depiction of such situations, he does get some pretty accurate depictions of them, especially when they include a group of women being sexually tortured by the Japanese. If you are a fan of Mark Lawrence, he has some good books in this series; however, his books are not all that great in their respective genre.   28 of 42 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1 1/2   I've read this a couple times, and it never seems to be able to put the book's themes together.   The only thing I can add to this review is I think it's very interesting that the author says: "The book was originally published in 1998 by a conservative evangelical publisher (with a conservative bias) and it is a fairly orthodox, almost evangelical, take on the story.  It's not very good but it's interesting." It's the same as the reviewer above.  I have no idea why a conservative publisher (i.e. someone who disagrees with the liberal religious right) would give a book a conservative label and then ignore or dismiss its progressive parts.  The "orthodox" part of the book, however, may be its progressive elements.  What makes a book conservative or progressive (and therefore an "orthodox") depends on what a reader wants it to be.  Perhaps I am wrong.  But in any case, the progressive elements in this book are quite interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book for the purposes of teaching a class to my middle school students. The only problem I ran into was with the writing. My students were able to comprehend what the teacher was saying, but the language just wasn't for me. The word choice, for example, was poor. I'm not sure what is more irritating, the poor writing or the poor grammar. This book isn't for everyone, but if you like good writing, good writing should be right up your alley.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     It seems like a bad idea to start the book with the main character dying but it turns out that they are just pretending it's a bad dream so that she can make sure she doesn't go back to the school for the rest of her life, even though the death never occurred and she did go through life as if it did.   Other than the poor writing it is just really awful that they try to convince the reader that the main characters are bad and then try to get around that by having the main female character die.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book about a year ago, and I was very disappointed with it. I loved the author's stories and felt like I got to know them well. However, I felt like this book was poorly plotted, with no real story lines, no plot twists that made sense, and a lot of filler. I couldn't connect to any of the characters, and the author made it clear she is writing this book just to make money. I got bored quickly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that I really liked:  The plot and the characters are all very interesting and I'd definitely recommend it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in its entirety and hated it. If you are not aware, the author has claimed that the main reason he chose to write a novel about a boy who is born gay was so that gay parents would have a way to tell their kids about being gay. He also claims that gay people are biologically different than straight people and can only be cured through therapy and medication (this may or may not be true but it is his opinion). I was disappointed in the fact that no gay parents (or anyone for that matter) were mentioned. The narrator is extremely negative, hateful and does not even try to hide it. His language is not a good representation of a gay man's personality, and there is also a lot of homophobia that is not even in the book. In this book, his hatred of gay people and his views on homosexuality are the main things that the reader gets to see. I would not recommend this book to anybody. It just did not have anything to offer me and I just feel really bad for anyone who reads it and thinks that this is how a good gay man should be treated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first chapter is terrible and I felt like I had no idea what was going on until the third paragraph.   This book is great for the beginning writer and the intermediate writer.  I love reading through it when I get home and rereading it when things get interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot was boring and very hard to follow. It was also very, very short. The characters were all a bit too similar. I had a hard time relating to one character and couldn't understand why she was trying so hard to avoid a crush on a popular guy. The story was also a little predictable, as each time a new character comes in, something bad happens and everyone says, "Oh, but look at her big forehead! She can't hide that!"    13 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author, John Jakes, doesn't even like this book. I liked the idea and the world and everything about it. What I didn't like is that the book doesn't do a good job at developing the characters and they get completely shoved to the sidelines. I have read many of John's books that I enjoyed, but this was a bad one, for the reasons stated above. I won't read the sequel. I'm giving it 1 star for being a very bad book, and 1 star because it is my first experience with John Jakers books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was intrigued by the premise that a young girl who was abandoned by her parents is a part of a secret society known as the Order. The setting of New York City and the setting of this book in particular is great. There were a lot of cool ideas like an organization that is more sophisticated than one could imagine and that would be of help to young women. My only problem with this book is that the romance ended and there was a really good ending. The romance did not last but it did not ruin the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a story about a young woman and her past.  "You would be a wise young woman to remember that I am more than just a symbol, a figurehead to be admired or a hero to be sought. I am your friend, your companion, your best friend, and your most loyal servant. If you can learn from me, then you are my equal." —Hester Atherton
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of your time and that of your loved ones. I really wanted to like this book but all I got was a list of topics he wanted to talk about in an introductory class.  I feel that the only reason he went with this topic is because it's the most easily talked about topic in this book.   He should have written a book for kids in this field who don't know about this topic (and for those who have) he should have said so.  The material that is in the book is just boring.  It's not enough to teach the basic principles of the law, but it is enough to get you through the basics of some laws.  My daughter had to use the book for her classes and that's because she didn't learn how to read in school so it helped.  What bothers me is how someone with a book like this would not talk about the problems this book has with it being for the first class in the class because that is what this book is.  A lot of people would tell me they used this book and it would make them feel like a waste.  This is a textbook written for the public schools that should be published in a different format. It's a great book for the private sector. I am glad I bought it and I'm sure a lot of my friends and students will be as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is not bad, but it is very predictable.   As much as I like the book and the characters, the book could have used an editor and I would have given it a 4 instead of a 3. The author has a hard time being consistent with the setting (or perhaps she wants to be consistent with what she is writing?).   However, the story that the book is telling is just great.  A must-read!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book. But, the plot seemed to be a bit out of place. There were two plot lines, both with different protagonists and different outcomes, but the story was pretty much the same. I was excited about the last 2/3rds of the book. It ended up being a pretty typical fantasy plot. However, the last part of the story turned out to be kind of disappointing. I found that to be one of the weaker aspects of the novel. I still enjoyed it, but I think that I could've done without some of the weak elements in the last 1/3 of the plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as part of a college literature course. It was okay.   This book would have been better with a different author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a total newbie to the world of reading.   However, after about 20 pages of the first novel in a series, I knew it was going to be a complete and utter failure.  And yet, I stuck with it and gave it my time and money.  I've only finished about 20% of the novels that I have read in the series,   but they are all amazing.  This will be the last book in the main series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a bad read. There is nothing good about this book. Nothing at all. This is a "gut feeling" book and it is not a good one at all; it's a bad experience with a bad ending. I give it a 1 because I like a good horror book but I gave it a 3 because the ending is just wrong. Read another review that describes how they can't get into the town, so the character is driven to kill everyone in the town - it's not the ending they were going for.  Good read. I had to look up the author of this book because I didn't know who he was. This book was good. I was surprised that this was an author that wasn't famous, as I was afraid it wouldn't be good, but it wasn't. This one was good for the most part. The story was good, and it was told well. I only give it 3 because it's an author I haven't heard of.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a 4 out of 5, but that's a very high rating for a book I hated. This book, though, is so awful and wrong about so many things. This is not a good read and it is not about "love". The first thing I notice about this book is that it is written by a man who is trying to be clever. The first scene is an example of this, the author takes a story about a man being unable to fall in love to make it seem more complicated than it really is. It is ridiculous. This whole book is like that. This story is all about a woman who falls in love with a man because he "loves" her. The author is trying so hard to give it a story but he is unable to do it. He tries to make up a story (which I think is his main problem with writing - trying to write a story that he doesn't understand - not because he can't but because he is trying too hard and cannot pull it off). The book ends with a huge reveal which is a lie. It also goes way too in-depth about her having a crush on her ex-boyfriend (which she doesn't) and he never told her about it and she was "so confused" - how does she know this??? It was pretty annoying. I'm glad she is happy, but I do not think she was ever "in love" with him in the first place. The whole story is so contrived it is laughable. Also, it says that the protagonist never loved her mother (another lie that I don't even believe) because she was never told by him about how she was with his mother. I don and am not sure if the story is about her getting over her feelings for him and him getting over his feelings for her but I think that's way too much information about them both. This sounds too much like a love story. I mean, if this book had been about love it would have been good but the fact it is about love makes it awful. Also the whole story about the woman getting a "bonding" experience with a person she is seeing (again, she never said anything about this) in a very weird way makes this story even worse and makes the story even harder to understand. It feels so contorted and unrealistic. So basically this story is stupid. I didn't hate this book because I wanted to like it, I hated it because I don
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main plot of the book is about the relationship between a girl and a boy, and the girl and the boy's parents. While I would have liked more development, I would still recommend this book. The characters were well-rounded, and I enjoyed the relationships between the main characters, but there were a few things I could not stand about the story. The book is really just about the friendship between a boy and girl, but then the book goes off on a tangent about how it is inappropriate to date someone of the opposite sex.   I liked this book, but the character I liked the least is the boy.  I don't think I can rate it at 4 stars because there are a few other characters in the story that I liked.  My only problem with this book was the writing style.  The story is written in first person, and in the second person, I found that I could see the feelings of the characters (although I still found it weird that it was about the boy, because I thought the story was about a girl).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read. It has a lot of very bad advice from a very bad author, and I feel that the author of this book should not have written it.  The idea is that you can't change the past by yourself.   You can try to control the past, but you can never be certain if the future will be better.  It has all this "feel good" advice in it, but doesn't really explain much, nor does it really seem to have much in the way of results. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this and I felt like a moron.   This is a book about a guy who goes around and talks to various women, and then decides to date one. This is all presented as "romance", but the ending doesn't hold up.  While the guy is obviously trying to get a girl to go out with him, it's not a romance, and the girl isn't particularly attractive either, and so the two of them can't develop a connection.  One girl is a complete idiot.  Even if he had a "girl" on the brain, it would still have been stupid to go to the trouble of doing something like this, and he's never going to find her attractive (she has the dumbest personality ever).   The other character is really annoying too.  She has a habit of talking out of the side of her mouth and is a total bitch to everyone.  That is a huge problem with the writing and a huge issue with the characters.  This book is really not worth my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an interesting read. I've read plenty of non-fiction, mainly by the same people, to make sure I understand what is going on in other countries. It's very helpful.  If I'm honest I was disappointed by the ending.   I'm a bit of a sucker for a good cliffhanger.  I was hoping there would be more of a resolution to this story.  The end of this book didn't seem nearly as satisfying as the beginning.  It was kind of disappointing but I will give it the benefit of the doubt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was terrible.   It was very difficult for me to read.  It felt like I was taking part in a bad TV show.  I had my suspicions about the characters but I couldn't tell why they were so terrible. If a novel was really terrible, then you'd know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this in my early teens. I was so looking forward to it but when I got it and read it, it was not so good. I mean, it had amazing and good writing, but then a lot of bad stuff happened in the story too. I hate to say it, but it didn't work for me. And, I mean it is the best writing I've seen in the genre, but still not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book sucks!  It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The writing is terrible. The storyline is the same as a tv show where the protagonist just gets killed over and over again. The only saving grace is the characters, but that's about it.  I can tell that the author is well liked by her fans, but I feel bad for her. I don't know if I'll bother with this series and if so, how long it will take me to get to the good stuff.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It has been very hard to find a great book that was actually about zombies.  They are so cool and creepy in zombie movies.  A friend of mine and I went to a zombie themed movie recently and I asked if I could see the zombie movie so he could show me his zombie book. I got the book, it is beautiful.  But it is not the right book for me.  It is too long.  The zombies are boring and the story is not that great.  This book really should have a longer book with more story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a really hard time with this book. I really didn't understand the point of the plot, and I can't really fathom why anyone would read it. The story is actually really interesting, but I never quite get into it. I do know, though, that the book was originally published as a serial, and if you're interested, there's a pdf of the first part that you might be interested in (in the same format as the original serial, with only 1 or 2 pages of the story per part). I also would really like to have seen a "Making Of" for this book, though - I love the way it's been edited, but in that format, the book is a bit too short. The only good part is when some of the "hero" (the hero's dad, in this case) is in the book, talking about the things the father goes through trying to save the kids' lives. - March 8, 2009Great story, but boring character
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you read this, it is a shame. This is a book about a man who suffers from sexual trauma as a child and eventually became obsessed with sex. His mind was being controlled by his mother and his father, whom he was supposed to be protecting. When he was a child, he watched his mother masturbate, and it haunted him. When I was a young adult, I read this book about what had happened. It had a very sadistic feel to it. A couple of years ago, I asked my daughter if she had ever read this sort of book. She said no. The author says that the story is true, and there's a scene where a little girl has a tantrum, and the parent throws her to the floor and sodomizes her. I think she was reading the book because of the sadistic feeling it had. I found this book to be very depressing and disturbing, and I feel the author's intent to write about the sex scene was just to shock the reader.   What I didn't like:  1. The sex scene:  I don't understand how that kind of sex scene could be in a children's book.  2. The character in this book: This book was written for people like me, who are not ashamed of having had sexual trauma. This book is about a little boy who gets sexually aroused by his sister's pee. He goes to his mother for advice about how he can fix this problem. He does not receive any useful advice from her, and her suggestions are pretty much worthless. This little boy is traumatized.  The main character in the book has a difficult time going back to his family and reconnecting with them. He starts to think that their behavior was not normal, and he does not think he is just like his father. It takes a long time for him to come to terms with his sexuality. His sister, who is his main source of sexual satisfaction, has been dead for many years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an excellent book about a man named Davenport who worked on the top of the World Trade Center. His job was to watch the planes coming down and help stop the people from the burning buildings from getting caught in the plane fuselage. He was killed in the second plane.   It is a sad book, I really did want to love Davenville but he didn't do enough to convince me he was someone who loved a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has a lot of problems: too much writing, too many characters, too much action, too little development, and not enough time to develop the characters.  I did not enjoy the plot at all: the heroine (the same as the hero in my opinion) does not have the time to do anything else.  But at least she is a main character.  Also, what the author says about the heroine is true.  She is not a princess.  No one wants to marry her because she is the heroine.  The book is filled with scenes where the hero is doing things which he was never given a reason to do in the book.  If the characters had time to get to know each other and have some fun, the plot would have been much better.  Finally, the author seems to think that all heroes are born, not made.

So far, we have had a good experience with it. It just has taken about two months for the drug to get to where it is now that she has started taking it. We don't have to deal with a constant barrage of paperwork and meetings with the doctor, and most days she is getting up before we do. That is a nice change, and I am very happy for her.  I like that she is not always working when she needs to be.  It also helps that the doctors have been really nice and we get to go to a few events at the end of every month.  She really does not have to worry about getting a job and the constant anxiety that comes with it anymore.  We have had great success with the first four months of our medication.  Hopefully we will be doing much better in the next 4 months. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry I didn't like this book.   The first half of this book is about a boy and his pet rat.  He is obsessed with rats, and seems to know quite a bit about rats.  The second half is about him trying to be a doctor when he has a problem with his liver.  This is about halfway through the book and it ends with the boy having to get his liver checked out, because it isn't quite right.  After the liver problem gets fixed, the boy is told he needs to get a new liver. He doesn't think he can be a good doctor without a new rat, and then it gets worse.  I thought he went overboard with rat books.  At the end of the book, he gets a new, good rat. It is nice of him to help, but it seems like the book just goes on and on and does nothing.  I like it that he had the rats, but I wasn't too thrilled about the rat section.  In conclusion, this book isn't bad, it's just that the book didn't do anything I found interesting or worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received this book from my friend as a Christmas present. I was not too excited about it, mainly due to the title: "The Devil's Work". I'm an avid fan of all sorts of horror, including the new "Devil's Due". This book is a much different animal. I thought it was quite enjoyable, especially the beginning. However, the main problem I had with it was the writing style. Although the book was entertaining at times, it became a slog when it came to plot development. The protagonist is a cop, and he is at least two-thirds of the way through his career. As an officer, his career is going quite well. He gets the respect of his colleagues. But then the book begins. The novel takes a turn for the worse, and all the characters are completely lost in the story. The ending was far-fetched, and I was expecting the series to come to a satisfying end. I do hope that the series continues in the future, but I wouldn't be surprised if the author decided to end it off before it really got going.   The only other thing I can say is that the book has good artwork, with nice color work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing in this book is great. This is the most complete story I've read on the subject of the paranormal so far. If you've read the books, you know this story will not disappoint. I especially liked the fact that this author was able to write in a way that doesn't make it seem like a gimmick. The only down side to this book would be the fact the book is only 616 pages long, so I doubt the story will be over in just a few more days (if ever) but for a book that is as complete as this is, I'm sure we'll have to wait a bit longer. If that's not a downside for you, I recommend this book to everyone who has read any of the books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... Read only to the end because the author has a bad habit of writing long chapters and then cutting them off with a cliffhanger... No story to speak of.. .. I have not read anything else by this author. I guess he needs to take a break.. This is an unfinished book. I am surprised there are still so many copies in print. There are more that I can get from the library. The book is too long, and it was a bad idea to publish this book, as there was never any story to the novel, the whole book consists of this one story.   This book would not be a good fit in my favorite fiction/non-fiction series: The Magician's Code. I will probably have to give it a miss and pick another book instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is very contrived. I have never understood the logic behind a villain in a story who can't tell the difference between good and evil. It is also a little hard to believe that the protagonist would go on to kill two men.   I thought the story was predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than a compilation of several bad books (including a book about the paranormal) from multiple authors, all in an attempt to cover a wide topic without a single good insight or piece of information. A lot of the time, the author goes over the same material again and again. He even uses the same spelling and grammar mistakes as he did with the book that he wrote in about 10 years ago. The only good things are a couple of minor plot developments that might be worth mentioning in a review (not enough to make me read this again, but the author is a writer at heart).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not good. The story is awful. The characters are shallow and the plot is contrived.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason that this book is in my "do not read" category is that it is the most boring book I have ever read. This is not a bad thing. It is actually a very good book. It may not be your cup of tea but for people who like to read this book, I recommend giving it a try. I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really like this book! Unfortunately, the plot was very predictable. The author said that the story was like a "somewhat-comedic, slightly-satirical take on the events that occurred during the 2008/2009 financial crisis." But I was just a little disappointed in the plot because it was so predictable. So, I just got frustrated and had to reread a lot of the book so I could figure out what was going on! The whole thing was just so predictable! There was just no sense of anything happening at all, and the author was so slow with telling us what was happening that I just gave up on reading it, especially after seeing the movie "We the Animals" by the same author!

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book. Unfortunately, it's a lot like the other books you can find on Amazon about women's health.   You start out with a chapter on a woman's health journey. It has pictures of healthy women in their twenties, thirties, and sixties. The text goes into detail about the medical causes of various health problems and gives tips on how to overcome health issues.  I liked the idea of giving women health tips.  However, I found it confusing in the beginning as the first half of the book was spent on a description of each health issue.  It took me awhile to figure out why a little food was bad and a lot was good.  Once I got through that part of the text I realized that the author was just trying to get women to think about the issues that have been plaguing them since childhood.  For example, it says that anemia is "the most common health problem of older women." It also says that "a long list of health problems can follow anorexia" such as "chronic pain and a chronic cough."   One of the chapters is dedicated to a woman who was anorexic.  There are lots of different problems and a long list.  The problem is that they all seem related to anorexa.  I found the sections on different causes of certain illnesses confusing and just as much as useless as the previous chapters.  Fruit:  What's the big deal?  There was a lot of information about the health issues, but there wasn't a whole lot of action.    The author mentions that a diet of bananas and apples was healthy, but that I didn't believe.  This book is full of diet tips, but it is really just diet advice.  That is not really an excuse to give advice.   I found that a lot more health issues could have been covered if there wasn the time to get into it.    The following sections describe each problem in more detail.  Many of them are not particularly helpful because they are either incorrect or just wrong.  If I am reading a book about a topic that I know very little about (and even less about a diet) I will want to know a lot about it.  In some cases I wanted more information because I had never heard about a certain health problem, but the author only gave me the barest information about that problem.  These chapters should
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst of the lot. I read this book at about 7:30 p.m. on a Friday night. This is the only review I will post because it is the one that got the least amount of attention and comments.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book. This book should be destroyed and all the copies destroyed.   There are a million things wrong with this book and I just can't put my finger on it. But there's something about a book about the "Gods" and the "gods' worship" that keeps it interesting... I guess I was just looking for a book to read that isn't all about sex and the occult.  I read a bunch of books on the gods and it seems like the gods are pretty much the same as the ones in the Old Testament.  This was the first book I ever owned, and I can see why my brother bought it when he was looking for some god-related material.  For whatever reason, I really didn't like this book.  If I could, I would probably just throw it in the garbage, as I have a feeling the author doesn't have the best interest in his work (as evidenced by the fact that he rewrote his book when it was rejected by other publishers).  It seemed like this was the author's response to his rejection from "the big two" publishers, so it's kinda pathetic to see it as anything but an attempt at self-promotion.  I think that the author is trying to build a cult by writing a book that he hopes will be sold to the masses.  What's even worse is the fact the book's the one that is rejected because it isn't "Christian."  I'll admit that there are some great passages, and it is well-written, but the actual writing and editing are terrible.  The author doesn'st even know his words and words have been changed over time.  It's like the guy is trying desperately to be a good Christian, but he's just never had a good teacher.  To be fair, I don't really give a fuck what the religious people or the godless people think about this book, as they probably don't need this book to know anything about gods or what they are.  And I'm not saying he's wrong about the religion of the Old Covenant, but you can't really write a bible without changing a little bit of the wording.  In fact, the bible is the only scripture the author quotes in the book, and the quotes are either from other people, books, or scripture.  This book is all about the myths the authors think people need to believe and worship, and their lack of respect
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read two of these now. They are very different.   The first is a romance novel with a good ending.  The second is a sci-fi, fantasy novel with poor ending. The first has a good plot, but doesn't come together, it's a little overrated for me.  In conclusion, the second book is not as good as the first one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is told from the point of view of the main character and the perspective of her dog. She has to choose between the dog and her boyfriend, who also has a problem with his dog. However, she doesn't go to the doctor about her boyfriend's problems. She decides to go to see her dog instead. However the dog is actually a psycho and she is tormented by his anger and jealousy. I don't know if the author can come up with anything better to use her character for. The pacing is so rushed it can't really build up anything to happen. The storyline is so contrived I am afraid the author will have to come up something really good to fill in the gaps.   (hide spoiler)] So it's only a book, a novel about a dog. But in a sense, it's not about a good dog. The dog is not a good person. He is a spoiled bitch. The book is about what the author calls "puppies" but he means dogs. But that's not the only problem with the book. If you were a dog and this was about you, what would you think? What would you do? The dog and the woman are so unhappy together, so miserable. What they do is they argue about the dog's food. He will go off to feed himself in a wooded area, but he will return with spoiled food. She gets mad at him, she says that the dog doesn't care about the food but she really cares about the wood. I think that the author wanted the dog to come across like a spoiled brat and when it doesn't it seems like the dog can't get over the relationship problem. It is the writer's choice to portray the dog in this way, but I wish it wasn't so. The writing is so clunky it is hard to get anything done. If there were a dialogue in here it would be difficult to follow. I know the book is supposed to be about the relationship between the man and the dog, but it feels more like the book talks about the woman.  This is the dog. He's a bit of a brat. He goes to a wood and comes back with a spoiled dinner. What does he want? He wants a bone. She says no. That's not a bone, that's a bone of a chicken. And that's the end of the story, just like the end to the book The story
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this as a gift for my mom (she loves all kinds of fiction) and I absolutely hated it! I just can't find a good way to describe it! This was my very first experience reading a book in the form of an actual book, and I don't like it one bit!   The book has all the problems I mentioned above. There are chapters without any story, chapters that aren't even about the main characters, and chapters that just feel like an excuse to tell us all about the heroine's relationship with a mysterious man in the previous chapter. The only redeeming feature I can think of is that there is one little girl who is constantly being bullied by her classmates. The ending is so bizarre I don's believe the author meant for the ending to be something positive, but as I said above, I don 't give a hoot about that.   I don't recommend this book for you if you don't love good fiction and are looking for something to read to pass the time, but if you are a fan of Harry Potter and are sick of it all, then I recommend it to you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book expecting the worst and I was not disappointed. The story of the child killer (a little boy named Mike who had been abused by his mother and was also molested by his uncle) has been done to death and here the author has done it to death as well. The protagonist's father is a psychopathic sadist who seems to have a fascination with sadistic child murders. The ending is the same as with other books on this subject and I don't feel like I can really complain. I wouldn't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the last couple of books I have read, it's like I've heard the same old story, about how the author has been making these terrible decisions. Not a good story. No one wants to read it and it's a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The writing is fine, but the main problem is that the book is written in a way that only a fool or someone with a very low IQ can understand. The author, a well-known personality known on the Internet (and elsewhere) for his bizarre rants, makes his opinions very clear." - J.W.M. The writing is very, very bad! This is a typical personality of someone who doesn't understand the basic difference between "rationality" and "lunacy". If you take an IQ test, and it says you are a 70, then you must be a 70 too, so I suppose your point is valid. If you are reading this book, then maybe you need to be tested (see below). If you want to be able to comprehend the ideas of your book, go outside, and don't read it! My wife and I read this book and we didn't understand a word.   One reviewer goes so far as to say that the author's opinions are all true, that is, he believes these things, but they just happen to be crazy.  The reason he doesn't think you should get married is because: (1) She's too young to be ready, (2) She is too much like her mother, (3) She has no self-control, (4) It would make her too old to have a husband, (5) It's a waste of money, (6) You have no friends and you can't have children. This is typical of "rational" thinking, which is exactly what is wrong with it.  It's the reason why the author thinks you should buy a book on "the secret to happiness", it is so wonderful.  One of the most annoying things about this book is, that the "science" doesn't even come close to back up the author. I'll show you how I got started with the problem.  You need to figure out if this book makes any sense. You do this by looking at a few things, and taking notes. There is not one single thing that the science doesn't say that supports the claims that the authors are making. The science says this:  You are not going to have children because the female body is very different from the male, so, in order to procreate successfully, you would have to have sex with both of them, but one of them would have no children, because you would not have the female
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't stop reading this book because it's so amazing. It's a very good story with a good ending. The characters are very well developed and there are some excellent scenes in the book which I think makes it even better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is a good one and the characters are quite good. However, the main problem with this story is that this is the only good story in the book.   I am not sure if the author is the bad writer or the publisher. The main character has this whole plot line revolving around him and his love interest (a black woman he meets) and the whole story is so predictable that it is frustrating.  And it is obvious that the author of the book did not read the book, because he did not know how to write a good romance, especially not a romance where the main character is white.  The other bad thing about this book is the cover.  It is just awful.  The main character gets murdered.  I hate the main heroine because the way she behaves towards the main male character is so selfish and stupid that you can't really love her. Also, I have a feeling that the other two protagonists are going to be the main antagonists in the next book, but this one was a bit boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has no plot and it makes no sense what ever happened. It's just a stupid story. It didn't seem like it would ever get out of the first draft. The author seems to have been drunk or high all of the time. If you're in the market for a book this bad, I suggest you buy another one instead. I give this one one star because it's the only good review i have ever received about a book from an author who is bad at writing and knows it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book after it was reviewed.  I read a lot of paranormal horror, so this book intrigued me. It was just about an old lady who's granddaughter wants her to help her with her house but she doesn't want to.  When she asks the grandmother if she really wants to help with the house, she says, "I don't know, maybe if you help me build my new house, I will, and if you don't, then I'll just build another one and do it right."  I was excited because a lot I read about paranormal things.  This was about a psychic that was really kind of annoying and annoying to deal with. I don't think the psychic was a really nice person, but I'm not sure how she could be really bad and still be so popular.  If you want a good ghost story and a scary one, this is what you should read. I liked it, but there are some parts I found really annoying (like the fact she wanted to build a new house with the help of her granddaughter... I can relate.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a classic fantasy book about the journey of a hero. The hero, Arthur, is called by a god who wants his sword for himself, but can't because his father has just died. The book tells of the hero's struggle to gain the sword and fulfill his destiny to slay the dragon who had destroyed his home.   A lot of the plot holes I found, like Arthur's character design and the fact that he spends most of the story sleeping in the tower, were explained in the sequel book by the author. This book, on the other hand, is very poorly written and has a very confusing story line.  This is a very strange book and not the kind of book you can read more than once.  While this is a solid fantasy book, I cannot recommend this book to anyone. I would rather wait until the next book from the same author and get the answers to some of the questions I have had about the character of Arthur and his struggle to acquire the sword.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was just ok. I didn't like much of what I read. The prose was somewhat dry, but I did read that a sequel would be published.   The only thing that stuck with me was a scene where the male narrator is trying to get in touch with his family through a diary and his mother is not responding to his calls. The book is about a young woman and the male male narrator, so it makes sense that he would be more emotional than her, but it took me a while to get used to the fact that I was supposed to relate to a boy as I did this book.   is about two young women who were growing up in the 1970's in the same suburb. It's a story of a girl who loves books and a boy who hates them and is always being told they're bad. The first girl is the only girl, the other is a boy. This book had more plot elements than you would expect, the female protagonist was the only main character. But this book is not as much about the female characters as the male characters. You get the idea from the start that the male main character hates reading, and there was an awful lot of plot elements that were just to make him like reading.The only things that stuck in my head were a boy whose name is "Joe" (he is a teenager), a girl called "Shelby", and two of the female protagonists. They are two of my favorite female characters from a book I have not read. There are things about the book that make me want to revisit it, such as a story where the female hero fights to stop her younger sister from having a "bad boy" friend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book suffers from so many problems that it is nearly unreadable. The prose, while not terribly interesting, is at least somewhat descriptive of the world in which the main characters live, and some of the descriptions are fairly interesting, if not entirely necessary to understand the story. If you really must know what is going on in the world, you can at least find out a few things about it in the first part of the book. I will say that it does become a little tedious a few times. Most of the time I did not care at all that much, but every now and then I would have to pause and give attention to something. I'm very glad I read the book, but I really wish that there were a few more things to get into the book before it was over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to this book, but the book ended up being terrible.   The plot is so weak.  The characters are so unlikable.  There are too many unanswered questions and mysteries.  A few points are raised, but many others are completely brushed under the carpet.  This is definitely a book for the children, as it is about a little girl who has no magic, but is really good with a knife.  I found this book really creepy, and didn't want to read it.  Recommended for the gothic/horror fans, but would also be unsuitable for young children.  Posted by Michael at 1:11 PM If you're a big fan of the first two books, you should try this one out. The story is much less confusing and much better written than the first book. There are still mysteries in this book that are left hanging, but that can be forgiven by the fact that the author has improved the story a great deal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for something new to read and stumbled across this book. I was disappointed with a few chapters that seemed like they were copy and pasted from an old book.   The book does not hold up when compared to modern books such as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but still is good entertainment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A few things that would make this book even better:  This book is very readable, and is a very good read. The pacing is perfect, it feels fast, and the ending (a nice one too) is wonderful. The book is also highly informative about all things, and there is lots of useful information on just about every topic. One thing that would have made this book better: The book could have been a little shorter.   The writing style is a little strange, and sometimes seems repetitive.  Overall:  I highly recommend this book. It is very well written, and a very informative read. I do wish that they'd have put the chapter names more clearly, but the book is definitely worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - The book is about a man whose only friend is a dog. They have to help their owner who lives in a giant building and the dog keeps dying. The story starts with the owner who is a good guy but he has no idea how to help the dog. I like the fact that the dog and the owner share a good heart. I don't like the story that the owner is very evil and the story is about how the dog needs to be saved from that guy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't have much to say about this book because it was terrible. My wife and I read this together about a week ago, and I was so disappointed. It took forever for this book to show up on our library's electronic reading list. I mean, how could they possibly do this to a classic? This book is about a person named John, who lives in the city of Rochester, Michigan, and he has two daughters, Mary and Mary Anne.   Mary Anne is a pretty little thing, but Mary Anne has some serious medical problems. One of her legs is paralyzed and her legs are weak from it, but there are many things that are so wrong with her that you can barely tell the difference. John is very concerned about his children, but he knows that if he leaves the house he will be very vulnerable.  One day he is walking to the store, and his daughter Mary Anne gets hit by a car. John loses control of his walking, and is thrown from his horse.  Mary Annie is knocked down, but is not hurt badly. John comes out of the barn and calls the police. His two daughters are taken into the house by the police, and they are put in foster care.  It is hard for John to understand this, but in his grief he has not stopped looking after his two girls.  In the following weeks, John's mind is filled with horror as he imagines Mary Annie having been in a car accident and then being taken away.  This is how he finds himself driving through a deserted parking lot with the lights of the city going by in the distance. It is about the time of the year when the trees are changing color and it is very cold out, and John is not cold at all. He finds his way to Mary Anne's house.  She is in the house, and has a lot of trouble, but she says that she is doing all right, and that the doctors are doing all they can.  John goes to find Mary Annie. He walks across the lawn into the kitchen and opens a bottle of wine. He has a glass in his hand, and then he gets up and leaves.  Later, he calls Mary Anne, and she calls her father. John tells her that the police are at the house. She answers her father's call.  I can't believe what I just said.  The last part of this paragraph is just a big mess. John arrives at the hospital,
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed the book, but it was written really badly and it's all downhill from there.  The story doesn't seem to have any real meaning, and the main character is an asshole.  I don't know if the author was trying to be funny, but the characters are just really shitty.   The book is just filled with bad writing and crappy dialogue, with most of the dialogue coming off like it was pulled out of the "It's Not Easy Being Green" movie.  So if you're looking for a good book to read, but just have a bad attitude towards your reading experience, then look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A really hard book. There are a couple times where I felt like the author was taking the book to far, but then when it comes to the main plotline, it is a real mess. I was really hoping for a real, true, dramatic story about what it's like to be a real woman in the world, but instead we get an awful parody. So hard to get through. If you are like me and you don't like to read books that are so serious, then this one might be for you. Otherwise, keep looking in the bookstores for a good book that is different. -Anonymous
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm reading the first few chapters of a novel that I absolutely loved. It's written in a humorous and upbeat manner, but it has a number of flaws. The dialogue is awkward, the characters are cardboard, the writing has a dull, flat quality to it, and the characters do nothing for me other than tell stories, mostly about a guy who loves them, but is never happy, which is a huge turn off.   My rating: I'm not sure I'll read this book. The beginning is good, the last half is bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great book that got me thinking about some of the basic issues of the past. Not my favorite but the book was well worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first thing that stood out about the book was that the author wrote the story in the third person. And she didn't even try to make it a little bit less confusing by breaking the action up into chapters. So, you might be left wondering how the author could know who the killer is in a story about a serial killer and yet not know that the killer's a serial murder killer. She doesn't even make that clear, though. She simply says, "She killed one and then another and then two," as though the third one had nothing to do with the others. Then there's the weird, off-putting sex. I think I would have preferred a story that just ended with the murder and no sex at all. But, like I said, it's not a bad story if you can deal with the awkward sex and the weird plot development. Also, the book is a little long, which I found quite odd since it seems to have a couple of chapters per chapter like this one. The narrator is good, but she sounds like she's reading it from a third-person point of view, and I could have done without the annoying, "Ooh!" ending. But she's a good narrator, so you should be okay with her narrating your book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A poorly written novel with bad prose." -I love this book. I think it is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. The language was very well done and the story was very interesting. I am not sure how the author could write a book like this without using a dictionary. I would give it a perfect 10. -The writing is good and it's nice and short. I really liked the description of a world in this book, it was so well done. But the actual plot in this one was not very good, at least from my point of view. The author really should have made it a bigger book, because I really do like the story, but I guess it is too short to get a good rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've always enjoyed the style of this series. The characters are quirky, the plot is well-developed, the action is good and the overall tone is light-hearted and a little humorous at times. The downside is that the story is inconsistent. The characterizations tend to vary depending on the protagonist's mood and actions (some good, some bad).   Some of the characters do develop into good characters but many of the other characters seem to have no redeeming value.   At one point I was rooting for a character I really disliked and was rooting against another character I liked! The ending, however, leaves a lot of unanswered questions and I'm interested to see where the series goes next. It's not my favorite of the books but it is good.   28 of 32 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a huge pile of bullshit. If you want a history of the Nazi Party, get the book by Hitler's best friend and close advisor Erwin Rommel. The only difference is Rommel doesn't have Hitler's wife, Eva Braun, and I wouldn't recommend it as a history book.   This book should not have been written. The people in charge of writing this book were insane. One section is called "Germany: Nazi Era" and is about the rise of the party, and how they went on to ruin Germany forever. This section is ridiculous. They don't even bother talking about the atrocities committed by the Nazis, just about how they ruined Germany. Even the Germans are not all evil. Hitler was not a terrible person, nor does he deserve this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book is bad for you.  It's a bad story that's missing so many key pieces that would have made it great.  In all honesty, I would have enjoyed this book more if it was just a good old fashioned pulp thriller.  I didn't like any of the characters, but I did appreciate the mystery.   It had a lot of potential, but it just couldn't quite manage it.  The cover is just plain ugly.  A good book is good for you:  A good book, if you like pulp fiction, will make you laugh out loud.  Sometimes it has a great plot, but sometimes it just lacks a little polish to get a good read out of it.   For me, this is a good book but not one that I can recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not give this one five stars because I didn't love it. I didn's t understand why the author went to the trouble of writing a story about a woman's life (in this case, a woman trapped in a man's body for twenty years), but then she chose not to go through with the storyline. This made me wonder if the author had decided to do an extended essay, or a novel instead, and decided she needed to put that aside. That's not to say I don't think that this book was worth reading; I do. The plot and some of the characters are interesting. That said, I don 't think I would recommend this book to anyone.   This review is not to discredit the original story written by Mary Higgins Clark. (I haven 't read it yet, but I will.) She does an excellent job with her story; she does not overdo it, but she is able to write a story with more detail and emotion than the original version did. (It's the fact that the original was written with more of a comedic or light tone, instead of the more serious nature found in this book that make me not recommend it to anyone.) That being said, this story (and the first chapter) were too over-the-top and in-your-face for me to recommend it, and I can't say I am particularly excited to read the rest of the story. I feel that the story has potential, and if it were written the original way I think it would be much more entertaining.   " I believe that it has been the fate of the female mind ever since the beginning, not merely to be subjugated by the male, but to be utterly disempowered in the face of a strong, determined, domineering man, who takes advantage of the helplessness of woman to control her; I believe the female body is in fact a weak, supple frame, easily bent to the will of the strong, and that woman is a creature of strong, powerful spirits, capable of great feats and of great suffering; but, I believe too, that woman possesses a spirit of great strength, a fierce, restless soul, which is awakened by suffering and which, as the old Indian prophet told us, has been waiting for a great leader to come along who would take it under his wing and teach it a new life; and I believe in this last belief I have a right to claim for my own woman
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought a copy of this from a local store to read. I read it on the plane and didn't want to miss the opportunity to read it. I'm glad I did, because it was a great read. There were some very good jokes (which I will admit are better than many in other books) and a lot of character development. The story was fast paced with a lot going on. I don't know how I ever got through a series of books in such a short period of time. The only thing that kept me from being completely satisfied with the book is that the author didn't always stick to a plot and wasn't a very good writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot was boring and the characters were boring. They were all the same kind of character.   This book was so boring.    The story begins with a woman named Kia who is a high school teacher with no money. One day a girl named Kori saves her life. Kori's family moved out of town, and her dad is in prison. She has two brothers who are in their late teens, so she's the youngest of four girls.  Kori is a bad student. She can't keep her head above water because of her siblings, so they all have to do menial jobs at school.  It doesn't take long for her family to get their lives together. Her dad is out of prison, her brother has a job, and she is in a good high school. Things don't exactly come together perfectly though, and Kia finds herself in love with a much younger boy.     There are no love triangles in this book.  There is just Kia and Kori.  I didn't like Kia's family or the fact that she had no support system. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I could not get over how dull this book was." "It was about half-way through the book that I realised it was a bit dull." "This book should have been called 'The Denseest of Smiles'. The characters were not interesting." "I thought I knew what I was reading at the beginning, but it was more like a dull reading than a good one."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book thinking that it was a book about some kind of underground society that had a secret order, like the Freemasons. The truth is that it's a book that is a collection of essays that was written by a guy who just wanted to be a writer. The essay about the Freemason order is the only really interesting one in this book, but the others all have to do with the author's life and how it influenced him and the direction of the book. The final one (about the relationship between religion and science) was interesting because I had not really given the topic much thought before reading it. I just thought that the writer wanted to say something profound about the role of religion and its role in our society, and then I realized that he was saying nothing, and that the subject of religion in our life was as far as I could see as a deep mystery and a mystery that can never be solved. I really felt a bit cheated because a book as good as this should have something more interesting to say about it, but I was disappointed. I think I would have liked this book better if it had been written by someone I had respected and admired, such as a philosopher. I hope that this book will help me to understand religion better because I still don't understand most of what I'm being taught in the Bible and religion (or spirituality) is a big part of my problem. It's not just that religion just sucks, it's also that it is just plain bad, which is a very hard thing to understand.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a good book though, but it is a horrible book for people like me.   I had been hoping to like it, but I was not happy.  It was hard for me to get into this book, but my main issue was with how the author portrays what happened to the little girl.  What is wrong with this girl?  Is she retarded? Is she a schizophrenic? Is it something else?   This is a young adult story in which the author wants to make it clear that he is not a pedophile, and that he does not want to harm any of the girls in his stories. He doesn't even have an issue with the little girls. What's his problem?  I like to be able to talk about books I have read.  I was able to have a good debate with a good friend about this book.  My friend found the author's characterizations of the girl to be really off-putting, but she was able not to put a bad review on the book. I found this book to be a lot less interesting and entertaining than I had expected it to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I gave this a 5 star rating for the first 4 chapters, but after that the book just went downhill. The book had a really nice cover.   The cover was perfect. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the author has written 5 other books with the same concept. The author describes how a character is about to commit suicide and then tells you how the character survives by changing the past. I gave this 5 stars because it had a very good premise, and the story really started to take off in the last 5 chapters. The last 5 pages, the author told me that the character got it right, but then forgot it in the past because she was worried about being judged by her parents. She didn't really think about how her mother and father were judging her. She also forgot how her grandfather had loved her all the time. It just doesn't sound right. The writer then wrote a scene where the character says that he got the right idea, but that he didn't remember that he made the wrong one. So he had to have done a lot of "thinking".   Then I was told that it was because of a mistake the character made in the book.    The last two chapters of the book were really stupid. The plot is that a character was supposed to die from a disease. She lived for two years without getting sick. Then she is going to die, but her family doesn't want her to take her last breath in front of them. So she tries to tell her parents, but they don't want to hear it. So when she finally does it, the last thing she did was go out in front the people that hated her and told them how much she loved them, but it just makes them hate her. Then her grandfather shows up and she doesn't believe him. The whole scene is so stupid and you couldn't help but want the character to die because she knew what was coming.  The last four chapters I felt were stupid.  I gave the book a 4 star rating because the first four were ok. The story kind of went downhill after that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you buy this book, you will not be disappointed. The first 50 pages of the book are all about the first two-thirds of the movie and are well written and informative. I'm still looking forward to this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book but unfortunately I felt it wasn't as good as it had the potential to be. I really liked the plot and the writing of it but the characters felt out of place in the story. The only person who felt like a main character was the protagonist. I felt like the main character felt like an idiot. Also I was a bit annoyed with the ending. It was a little abrupt but I'll give it that. I will give this book 5 stars because it's a good book. I'll leave it there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most horrible thing I can think of is that the author is a child of the seventies who never grew out of it! This is why he has a writing style so similar to his own childhood.   This is the only novel of his that I have found as boring as the previous.  He is a writer who should stick to the more serious genres.  3 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first five or six chapters of the book were good, it seemed to have a solid hook and I would keep reading the whole book but the author goes on with a lot of empty talk without doing anything of interest. The last part of the story is extremely boring and seems to be just to pad the book. As for the characters, they are really flat and only have two and I don't think they have anything to say. The author makes all the characters very similar, even the minor characters. The book is just really boring, I won't be re-reading this book ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is a very poor book.   The main character, who was in a relationship with her high school sweetheart (with whom she has been with since she was 14) dies after being raped in a bar. She then gets a boyfriend, but her boyfriend is a bad person, a stalker and not what she thought he was. She finally manages to leave him but is attacked and raped by the boyfriend's friends when she tries to leave the bar. In the process of dealing with this terrible event, the main character suffers severe PTSD and becomes suicidal and is prescribed therapy which just reinforces her depression, as it isn't doing anything to solve the problem.  After this traumatic event, she is then raped by another man. This is just horrible.  This book is also very misogynistic, since the main man is a loser, has a girlfriend who he really does want to be with, and she ends up sleeping with the loser. In a way, the book is just a continuation of the rape scene (even though it's a flashback to the rape) as the main woman is still a virgin and the man gets her pregnant by accident.  The woman has also gone off to college but can't get over her rape so she ends things by throwing herself at a boyfriend who is cheating on her.  Her suicide ends the relationship and she starts dating a man again.   She ends up going off to a party with her rapist's friend who gets her drunk and rapes her in the bathroom. When the main characters tries to intervene, the man's friend turns the tables and rapes the main female character instead.  This story was a complete and utter failure to write.  It was written very poorly, with lots of misspelling, grammatical errors and spelling mistakes.  The main characters in this book were all just horrible, unlikable people.  There's an aspect about their relationships that really bothered me.  In this story, the boyfriend of the main victim ends up being a good guy, and the rapist's boyfriend ends up a horrible, disgusting person.  So, how was the story supposed to be about the female character who suffers from severe PTSD, her suicide, and her rapist boyfriend?  He was the only character that I cared about, so this book wasn't about her at all, it was about the rapist.  Why can't the main male character be someone who was sympathetic to the heroine in this story? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I bought the book for the first time just to see how well it is written. I expected some humor but found it not funny enough, it's like watching the movie The Last Man on Earth, but I have never seen the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book at all. I have a very hard time reading romance and this was not it. I will be rereading this book.    I didn't enjoy this book: 4 out of 5  I don't know why I read this book, I thought it was terrible! It was pretty bad overall, but I read the first book because I really liked the first. So I read that and thought, yeah, this should be a solid first book. However, I just did not enjoy it one bit. I felt like this one was really trying to give me a romantic story, but the love story is not the best thing ever! But, that is just my opinion, I don�t know if anyone else will agree or disagree with me, but just to be honest I really don�T like romantic romance! So I guess, yeah I am disappointed. So overall, it really didn�t really bother me, I am glad I read it though.  I will be reading the second book in the series:  Why does this book keep getting 3 stars:  I do not like a book unless the main character is amazing and this book is not. The main character did the best job ever in her short time with the guys, but by the end of the book she had just as many issues with the guy as the other guys did with her! This book was horrible.  I will not be re-reading this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - "The book is good. I have to say that I'm disappointed. I got it from the library. When I asked the librarian about it I was told it was the "worst" book she'd ever seen. I've only seen it once before, on a library card and that was with the library's reference. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" has some great moments and some bad but I'm just not really into the style. "This is the only book I've read that has been so bad that I wanted to throw it across the room. It really is a slog through a pile of garbage." - "Boring and uninteresting." -   "Well, I'm certainly not one to be overly critical and I can't say I enjoyed the book at all. There were a few good moments but nothing amazing. " I like it less and less the more I think about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a huge fan of these books, and this one is no exception. The protagonist is a very strong and likable protagonist. He has a lot to say about life, love, and his family, but his delivery is not good. For example, he says some people think "they're special," and then says, "They aren't." (What do you even mean by that? Is he a genius?) But other times he is vague, uninspired, and a bit vague. Other times he sounds off. He says, for example, "I'd like to think I've learned my lesson." That is a great sentiment, but it's too vague to really be a lesson. He's not going to make you better, but you can always say he has learned something about himself. It's not really a lesson, but a way of saying, "You shouldn't treat people this way, or that way." But the worst part is, this book is really boring. I just don't get it. I didn't understand half the points he was making, and I think my reading comprehension was awful at times. I would like to give it another shot, though I'd prefer not to read a book that takes me five chapters to get through, but I couldn't. There are a lot of people on Goodreads who have loved this one. I'm not one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't say this was my favorite book. I didn't like it at all. I think the book is just a collection of different stories told in various ways and the author really got out of hand with it. He did a good job of creating his character, but at times I didn andt get the point he was trying to get at, or the writing style was just so weird, that it didn't work. I also really thought that he got a few things wrong in it, like the name of the author's grandfather being "Bud", and the fact that he actually lived with his grandfather for a time. Other than that though, I loved it so much I kept reading, and if it had any of the interesting characters I liked in my other favorite series, I'd be reading a lot more of these. It doesn't help that the author got a book deal out of it as well, so maybe this is a good book if you have a passion for writing books about people.   I like to use the following categories when giving my opinion on a book: (The more categories you have the better, but keep it down to two. I know you have more than that, but I don't want to be rude to you.) 1) Would I recommend this book to a friend? 2) Would you recommend this to a total stranger? 3) Do you like this series? If not, why not? 4) Would this story appeal to a complete stranger?  13 of 20 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is extremely dull and does not go in a single direction for more than 30 pages. A large part of the book is spent trying to determine who killed off the girl, and there is nothing interesting in the mystery or the outcome. The author tries to build up a romance, but it's not very satisfying, especially since the relationship in the beginning is so weird. The plot ends in the last 30 pages and it would be great if the author would just finish the book instead of starting over again. - - - Summary: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not been this disappointed by a book in ages. It was a book that made me feel that I was reading something I didn't want to have to take my eyes off for long periods of time. I was constantly thinking about the bad things and that I really didn't care about the good things that happened to the character. Not only was this book a waste of time and the characters were just not well written, but the story was just ridiculous and stupid. I don't think the author knows how to write a coherent story. The book is not over long enough to have a good ending and you can't understand anything that happened or did. I really do not recommend reading this book, unless you really like books that are just boring and nonsensical and are over long. It's definitely not worth your time, and if you are looking for something that will make you feel like you were in a story that is about as interesting as the one you are reading right now, I would say just skip this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry that I didn't like this one. It's just that there's nothing positive to say about it.   The only good thing I can say about this book is the cover. It could have been a better book because I was interested in the author's theory but I didn''t like it. The title is really confusing because the author doesn''t really explain anything at all. He just tells you about how things are so different from your current life and you should go back to that way of life. It''s all over the place, but the author claims that it will all make sense later.  The chapter about the beginning of my love life was the one that bugged me the most. He told me that I will learn all about it in the future and that everything will be all right, but after the chapter I just had this feeling like it was going to end badly.  I don''t even know if the chapters about the love life have anything to do with the main story because it''s so long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would give it a solid 3 stars, but i found that it has really poor characterizations of each of the characters, and the story is extremely cliche in every way possible (from the start, we learn that our hero is a wuss who can't get laid). And its pretty weak story-wise, really, because we have been told all along that our protagonist is a big loser and is about to fail at everything he attempts to do (but who cares about that, he's going to have sex with a 13 year old!). The book is so weak, I just couldn't get into it. Posted by Anonymous at 10:32 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books where the reader would really enjoy reading it, but just cannot find the time.   I think I have read this book at least 100 times.  This was the second book I have ever read by the author, and the first book is the best and most popular book by him.  I thought the first chapter was wonderful, and it was well written.  The only thing that I did not like about this book is that the author's style is so dry and monotonous.  "This book is a great description of a culture. I thought it would be a good story that would be fun to read.  It just seems like a waste of time to read this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    1.   2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10.  A book that I really wanted to like but didn't. The story is simple enough: a guy in his thirties, a divorced father, gets married with three young children and moves to New York with his family. Well... I'm going to start by saying that I'm an idiot for wanting to like the book. It's not bad, but in no way does it meet the standard that most authors have set for themselves. It just feels like a boring book. The writing is mediocre, the story is weak. It makes you want to throw the book at the screen and start over, but it's not worth the hassle. I'm a big fan of John Scalzi, so I'll give the book some credit. It was written in a similar vein to his old "The Book of the New Sun" series, and in that case, it had some decent ideas in it, but didn the book justice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been wanting a "real" science fiction/fantasy novel since The Eye of the World, and the one I got is basically a bad copy of the later book. I read all three in a row in less than a week, and I think I liked one better than the other two. I'm hoping a decent, original book will come out sometime. But for now, this is one that doesn't stand up to the rest. I've had this book on my wish list for a very long time, but the reviews that I found all mentioned a bad ending, and not a good ending. I've read this as a novella, and as a whole book, and the ending is a bit of a let down. I am glad I read this book as a one-shot, because the end of the novelette left me somewhat unsatisfied.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason this book even got read was because I didn't really like any of the other books (even though it's a "fantasy").  It seems like it should be a comedy but was so bland it made the rest of the book a chore to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think I can relate to the "I don't like this so it must be bad" comments. This book was terrible, I really hated it. I don't even like horror novels, I tend to prefer non-fiction, I am not good at horror and this book was just so bad. I found the writing to be awful, the character to be extremely flat and repetitive. I think it could have been a good book, the characters were interesting enough but it really didn't work for me. It was just plain bad and really didn the story in for me "I know nothing but the truth." "And the end is always the same. That's not even true anymore. It's changed."   One of the great problems of writing is that the reader must feel the narrator's feelings, even though the author may be telling a completely different story.   The author never bothered to tell me anything about the main character, he simply describes her as a dumb, incompetent person.  When he said it felt as if he was describing a dead person he was wrong, I found that it felt like a dead woman speaking in his book.  The first chapter had the reader feeling as if we were watching the character in their mind, then later when he says something that feels out of character it doesn't feel like we are in his head, it feels like we were following her with a notebook, a person in the story. He says that his voice is distorted, it felt very unnatural to read and I thought it just didn't feel real to me.  I feel like I've read this book before, but I found I didn't remember a single thing that was in the book. I really couldn't give this book any stars, but my only suggestion would be that if someone were to write a book about someone being in the wrong and then getting away with it, maybe he should write a sequel and update the story so he knows everything that is going on, then the readers can enjoy seeing him grow from bad to good and finally, learn the truth.  "You know everything's a lie."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book. There is just so much in here about love and sex. I loved the story about the man who had two kids and was having an affair with a woman while they were having sex. It's about a good, Christian man who is trying to do the right thing while he is in love. Then when the woman finds out, she doesn't seem to care. It made me happy. I would recommend this book to all of my friends. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is pretty much an old fashioned thriller. The plot is very familiar, but that's not bad per se; it's just bad. It's not a bad read per se, but it's not the kind of good story that makes up for the plot's shortcomings. The characters were uninteresting and were more a plot device than a real group of people. The story itself is kind of boring and didn't really grab me, and I only gave the book 4 stars because I'm just too tired of reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I read this book back in 2012, and after reading the first half, we had to put it down due to the repetitive nature of the story and the fact that we really did not care for the protagonist. We also didn't like the story's "gift" of having a main character who is not only unlikable, but also is a bully and who is in the end an absolute bitch. (view spoiler) We've read a few good book and one bad one, and I guess it's time to give the book a whirl again.   We found out that we are going to have a baby, which, as the book goes on, becomes the most horrible subject to deal with for the three of us. The three of them have been in and out of a long distance relationship for several years now, and it's been quite the struggle for all three of their friends and family to accept them. They have a long history of bickering, being bullied, and generally behaving like a bunch of little kids. The book gives us a few insights as to why this has become a problem, and what the future may hold for all four of the main characters.   The characters do not develop very well, as they all seem to be so much alike. Each character's childhood is depicted in some way, but the story seems to have an overarching "gospel" to the tale and it is never explained, other than to say that God hates those with big heads.   And then we get to the plot: A character named Sperk gets in a car crash and has a heart attack. This, we are told, is the cause of the child born to him and his wife. This child, she has been told, will be a genius. This baby will not only have the gifts of genius, but will also have the personality to match, being a "sissy" and always getting the short end of the stick. This is not so long a stretch as it sounds, as Sperks wife, whom Sperkas wife hates, is also a genius, she just isn't born with her gifts as a result of having such a great wife. Her gifts are only brought about as a direct result of her work ethic, but are never mentioned. She never even seems to consider the fact or that the reason that she can be a good wife and also be a super genius is due to her work, rather than
Write a negative review about a bad book:     When I first opened this book, I was excited by the cover and the idea of a science fiction novel set in the future. I found the book to be very enjoyable and fun, though I was disappointed that the author does not make his point in a much more interesting way than just saying "we will conquer the stars!". While it is obvious that the novel was written as a satire of futurist thought, I feel that the real message and message that is not expressed is that we need to get off our butts and be real. The problem is not the ideas that are used to make it funny or the fact that the book is set on an earth and the Earth is dying and there is a giant ship that is going to save us from ourselves, but the fact of the matter is that the Earth has gotten itself into a pretty deep hole that we are only getting out of as we move out into space. The Earth will continue to sink through the Earth's crust and eventually it will sink so deep that it will destroy the life support systems of life on the Earth.   In the final analysis, I think that what makes this book funny is that it is a satire and not a serious study about our future. This is another example of the "the future is bright" attitude of many futurists, which I feel is a rather naive and unrealistic outlook. I hope that the authors of this book get into space to find out more about the real problem and how they can save us all before it is too late.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the most disappointing read I have ever had from Mr. Martin. The characters are the problem - and Mr. Smith is as uninspiring as he is lazy. I would have liked to read more about his childhood. I liked the story because it is about a boy and his father, but it is a short, predictable story and I did not care for the plot. I think this book would be better if there was no mention of his father at all, and the other characters are much better developed.   I really don't think I'll ever read any of his books - I think he is an author who writes good books, but when you read about these little kids who are the focus, they have a lot of problems which never get resolved. They are too perfect, and their parents are terrible and never help them when they are in trouble. There were times where the characters were a little too perfect for my taste, but other than that I enjoyed it a lot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is nothing special: a generic first person narrative about a man whose mother is very sick, which goes off on a tangent about the mother-in-law that causes the man to have a nervous breakdown and kill his mother. What's more, the character he writes about is a really stupid jerk.   I don't really get the point of the book, although there are plenty of moments that got under my skin. This is a fairly dull book, and the fact that it was published in the 80's in the heyday of vampire/ghost stories certainly didn't help.   "He felt like a vampire. He was one, even if he didn't have any of the blood and other bodily fluids and special powers that vampires had. But he was not a vampire, because vampires were real. That was the thing he couldn't believe. A real vampire had to eat blood."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It started as a great little historical novel with a lot of depth, but that depth was lost in translation. The translation had a lot more grammar errors, especially regarding the use of the passive voice, and the story became far more predictable with the exception of the final chapter, but the fact remains that there was more than enough going on to keep the reader hooked.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a collection of short stories by three authors. They have a tendency to be very short but I liked them all the same. The story "Traveller" about a woman who was kidnapped and forced to become an air traffic controller was quite funny and I liked the story about a little girl who is abducted by aliens. I also enjoyed the story "Lucky", about a man who has to play the stock market to help the family get by. The stories are short but do keep me interested. I'll probably pick up some more stories by the authors to see how they differ. (Posted on 7/4/2008)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book, not only, once, but twice. Once I was able to finish the book, which was rather difficult, as it kept me enthralled for more than an hour. Then I was even able to find a place in my "to-read" pile. I was hoping to find more of the "good" in the second reading.   However, the third time, I had to finish this book so I could write a review. I have seen people give this book 4 stars, and I must say, those people should not have read a first time, second time, and third time book. I would also like to say that this book was written in a kind of a "cute way" and that makes it hard to finish.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book has all its good parts.   The characters are well realized.  The plot is good.  Unfortunately, the characters do not live up to the expectations the writer placed for them.  I expected the heroine to be a strong character, but I found she was too weak to do anything worthwhile.  At times I felt the author didn't understand the point of the story.  There is a point at which the reader can just look at the character and say: "I wouldn't do that".  It does not help that the characters were written by different authors in different genres.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've seen many people rave about this book (one person called it the best book about writing he'd ever read) but my expectations were so low after reading the book on Goodreads I couldn't help myself from feeling disappointed.  I was intrigued by the premise of the book, and even though I think the book itself was somewhat boring it did offer some tips on how to write well (as well as how to not suck at your craft) and whatnot, but I didn't find myself enjoying the story as much as I thought I would (at least not for the entire book)   The main character, Aiden (I'm going to call him that because it's not really a name because he's too much of a wanker), has an awful first experience with a relationship.   For whatever reason it takes the better part of the first half of the novel to get to where he is right now.  While it's obvious that this guy is not ready to make a commitment to anyone, Ayden is also very uncoordinated, so his writing becomes all over the place.  This is not to say that he doesn't have some great lines - just, really, really bad ones. It's very jarring to read.  The story is a love-story that Aiden's character is telling (I call it his "love letter") to someone he doesn' t even remember (I think) and this isn't an accident - this isn' t a random love letter from a guy who wants to "go out with his own kind," it's a love letter written to the guy who has been doing him a solid for a long time now. And then he ends up being pretty shitty about it.  Another person who was excited about this novel was another person who didn't really like it:  I was so happy to be so right about this. I liked the idea, but the execution sucks. I found myself not liking the book nearly as much.  It's like Aiden is a broken record, that the person trying to write a perfect love letter is never there and Aiden never writes a perfect first impression. And to make matters worse, Aydon has a very annoying personality.  And then there's the whole thing about the guy she was writing to, and how she could have just been a little bit more specific about her feelings (if she wanted to be), but she didn't.  My main
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a nice book about the history of photography, but it's really, really bad.  I've bought other books about photography.  This one is more about what we want our camera to do than what our cameras do.  The photographer, William Eggleston, is always talking about photography as a "universal medium" rather than "an art form."  He describes himself as a photographer who was looking at photography from an "architectural" perspective, where he thinks of "the architect as having the ability to move the camera, and the photographer has the ability, from a photographic point of view, to photograph the architect."   I see nothing that this says about photography that doesn't already exist.  It gives no useful insight into how photography is produced (why some photographers move their cameras around as opposed to just pressing a button and waiting for a moment to photograph), or the way photographers actually photograph each other (when they shoot, how much information they take in, and how they use their cameras).  This also is a book about history, but never about history in the historical sense:  In the book's introduction, Egglestone explains that this book "is a kind of chronicle of my journey in the search for what makes photography such a universal medium."  (I can't imagine that's what this was about.)    While the author describes photography as being a universal form and an art form that has "lived through the history and the turmoil of humanity," I can't help but think that this is a pretty empty statement.   Egglestine describes a "tradition of taking photographs of strangers" and calls himself "a photographer in the tradition of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, David Rumsey, and Ansel Adams."  Yet all of those photographers (and their peers) made a very specific kind of documentary photography, and that tradition of photography is the one that Egglestation, and all of his predecessors in the style, have been trying to follow.  In fact, if Egglestein wants to get more specific about the "trademark" of photography he's referencing, he should have named the genre he's referring to.  A photographer who makes the kind of photographs Egglesta has already described as "tradicional" is just as much a part of the tradition as any of the photographers in this book.  Why does the author claim photography is universal (like
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book! It was very realistic and I can relate to her being on a train that is almost lost. This book was great at showing a very different side of herself. I hope that I can find another like this book and that I love to read about her adventures.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband didn't want to read this book, but he did, and he liked it, although he didn't like the ending. It wasn't bad, but the ending was very sad. The book had a lot of good ideas, and it may appeal to some people. I don't feel like I'd be reading a book by the same author after this one. There are too many plot holes to make this one worth the read. Rating: 1  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the pacing of the book to be pretty poor. This book, in particular, felt very rushed and a bit rushed, if only for the purpose of telling you what happened with a nice short synopsis. But the pacing is bad enough that it completely detracted from the story. It really made the novel feel like it was just a prologue to something else (it was really more like a few chapters of a new book). Also, it seemed that one of the characters (one of the main characters) just wanted everyone else dead, because she knew that all the other characters were going to go after him. It's just, I feel, a lot too convenient and a lot of things just seemed like they were happening because of the bad times.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read it, I really did, and I'm glad to have it, but the first 10% of the book is bad and I don't know why they're so obsessed with it in the last 10%. This is another book that I'm very glad I got but really wish I hadn't because I wouldn't have spent as much time on this one as I did. I love the characters but I think the whole "they could use your help" thing is boring and annoying. And the characters have too many layers and it becomes difficult to understand what's really going on at times. I wish they would have split them up a bit more and made a story that was more focused on the two main characters and made them actually fight for what's best for the world. There's still good moments here.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book in order to get back into a good science fiction book. What a waste of money. There are a few things about this book that I liked. First of all, it is a good story. It is well done, and I found it to be a well told story about a character I really want to like. But this book is so stupid. I am not even going to say anything bad about the main character. The author clearly took the idea for the book from a video game about a time machine. The game did not even have a time traveler. The main character does not even seem to care that her daughter is born with magical powers, that her world is in trouble because of the time traveler, and that she needs to save the planet because the time travelers have a plan. That does not seem like a plot point in the video game that is clearly based on Star Trek. However, the author is completely incompetent at writing a story. The only reason I can figure that the author would write this story is because the author was obsessed with making the character look like she was part of the original cast of the video games and she simply couldn't do anything else. It really doesn't work. The story does not feel like the author could have written the story any other way. I also don't care about the story. I want to believe in the characters. The characters are not believable and don't act like real people, or at least they do not act like realistic people. This is especially true of the main characters. Their actions feel arbitrary. I was hoping for a good action adventure. What happened to the book being good was really a let down. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it is very hard to believe any of the characters in it actually exist.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . .. I think this book has all the traits of a bad, bad book;   to the point that I was annoyed by it,   and   is hard to recommend to anyone other than someone who has read many books that are so bad they are good, bad books.   The book   does have a good idea   of what to say about   this,  but this book  is not bad at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I got hooked on the title of the book. It seemed really cool and I wanted to read it but I can't. The book starts out interesting, with a narrator who goes by the pseudonym "Ralph" narrating his adventures. He travels around with his girlfriend, named "Shelley" (I had to look it up) and a traveling carnival. The narrator makes it seem like he's always having fun (and has a sense of humor about it) but at the same time, he always seems depressed and on the edge. It's like his moods change throughout the book and I would be surprised if he was always this depressed.   There is something really weird about this narrator. After his adventures in the carnival, the narrator takes off with a circus called The Blue Frogs. Unfortunately, the only thing this narrator finds exciting about the circus is the singing. When the narrator's girlfriend tries to seduce him and tells him about the Blue Frog Circus, he quickly decides to go, despite his friend's protests. They go to see a show and while they are there, they notice the Blue frogs are starting to sing. Suddenly, they decide to get on the "Blue Frogs" and try singing with them. They get on and start singing "I'm a Blue Frog" because of course they do! They do get a little drunk and get into the "hot tub" where they try to get drunk off the drink. The song is a little cheesy, but I guess that's just what they get drunk from. I mean they're drunk off of vodka, but still. It gets really awkward around this point, especially when one of the frogs goes and sits down on top of the narrator, making him uncomfortable.  While they're in the hot tub, the frogs sing another song. Then they go to the pool party and start to dance, but then one of them goes to the bar to get a drink and when he gets back, he sees the other frogs are getting drunk. At this point I was starting to worry about this book.  It got worse when the narrator and his girlfriend were going to go to their honeymoon, because they were getting drunk from the show. It was too bad because this book had been on my to read list for months now and I really wanted to love this book!   It started off promising but then all of a sudden the narrator is acting like he
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this one and it was pretty bad, there wasn't much plot or anything, there's only one good thing about it that I remember, it was about a princess with a really cool sword and it got kinda annoying after a while, there was one scene that was pretty much a rip off of the Sword in the Stone and I was kinda hoping that it wouldn't come out, it wasn't that bad though, I'd still give it a 1.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading this book knowing the reviews were all about the sex and the threesome. I didn't give it a chance. My husband and I read the book together and I found it annoying. It was just boring. I was looking for something sexy and sexy wasn't here.     I don't get a thrill from reading about sex or threesomes because I can read about it a million times better from a book. It wasn't that the book wasn't well written and it didn't read as sexy as the reviews would have you believe.  It was boring. It just wasn't exciting.  I have to admit that I did like the sex scenes but it was mostly because I am a woman and I enjoy women's sex as much as I enjoy men's sex, even though I prefer men's and the more I read about the women it gets boring. The sex was interesting but the book read like a man reading about himself in the sex scene.  The author is supposed to be a writer.  She needs to write about something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed by this book. I have read and loved many books by other authors, but this one...I felt it was way to long. I finished the book in a few days. I think I just got worn out from being around the subject all day and all night, and wanted a break. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really disappointed by this book and how it is being published by the university press. It has been over 30 years since the publication of  the best book on the topic, the one that started the entire UFO mystery in the first place, but this book goes out of its way to try to make a buck. As far as I'm concerned this book is a total failure and I am a huge fan of the original work by Stanton Friedman. I would never have published this book had I known it was being published in this manner. I can only hope that this book somehow manages to reach more readers. I was never a believer in UFOs but this one gives me reason to start thinking about the phenomenon again. It's probably the one book I have ever had that gave me a great deal of insight. My problem is that I can't find a copy anywhere, which is a shame because I really wanted to read it for the first time in almost 30 years.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "new" book by this author is about a man and woman and their children who have a lot of fighting and problems. However, there is a very interesting thing in this book which I wish that more people would read. There is a book in this author's collection called 'The Big Book of Fights' which is the best book about fights in the world. The author tells about many famous fights and then makes up a bunch of stories about people and their fights. Then he puts the characters in a list of the 10 best fighters of all time (although he probably would not give this book a 10 if he wrote it as a full book). In addition, the book also has a list that he put of his favorite fights with his favorite fighters. He does make up stories about many of the famous fights, but what really interests me was his story about how one of the greatest fighters in his time actually said that one of his biggest fights ever was against someone from the same village in which he grew up. The 'New' Book by this Author, 'The Book of the Fight' is an excellent book about fighting as a whole. It has the whole story about fighting, from the creation of a person's fighting style, to training techniques, training injuries, and finally the actual fights. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of fighting. I gave this book 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a pity that such a nice story has been cut out. I am not saying that it is a good book, only that it has something to offer and that is a lot of good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is horrible!  I read this on a whim after listening to the podcast with my daughter when we were traveling in Europe. The first time I opened the book, I felt like I was in a horror movie. The words were really off and I thought the author had a lot more insight and experience in the paranormal than I do. There are many scary stories about vampires, ghosts, and poltergeists but these things don't sound like anything I've experienced. The author also claims that her father experienced all of the supernatural, including poltergeist activity. The chapters are so disjointed that even trying to follow along became difficult. The only reason I gave this book a 3 was because I still enjoyed the audio with my 5 year old.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I've ever read. As a reader I feel like I have to do some sort of a "good" in this one or it's just a really awful book. The book opens with a really boring first sentence by a woman who is a single mom trying to get by by working a dead end job and doing menial jobs around town. This character is completely unlikable and only serves as a plot device for the rest of the book. What makes it worse is that her character gets a major personality change at the end of the novel and it's so terrible that it doesn't even feel like a change. I never liked her character from the beginning so now I dislike her to some extent. There's an obvious point to the book but she goes about pushing that point so far that it just feels completely forced and unnecessary. In the middle of the "book" you have a character, a good-natured one at least, that gives an incredibly condescending look at a couple of kids who seem to be doing really well at a nearby high school. A couple chapters later, after it is revealed that the girl was on drugs at some point, and probably is still, this guy from this school walks up and says: "How you been doing, man? I just got out of the hospital. Been so sick of those dumb kids running around making me feel like shit, especially you, you. Why don't you just get your life together and go make it on your own? Why do you think you deserve this? You're just some dumb kid, who's got no respect for anyone. All you're doing is sitting around and doing nothing all the time. It's a waste of life!" That is one of the saddest things I have ever heard in my life. If that was said by any of my friends it would be the end. It is truly disappointing to read a book where someone will just say those things in the hopes that the reader will think "That's how it is. That's just the way things are. That doesn't justify what she said about them." It's so much worse then a book that has a character that is a complete psychopath.  My Rating:  The bad things about the book: This was the first book in the "Tara Chronicles" series so it's not a complete waste of money. The problems that come from this book were more so then the good things but I have a hard
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are plenty of good books, but this one stinks:  The story is set in the future when people have the choice of whether or not to have children. The choices are:  - have children to make a family.  - not have children at all.  There's a very bad (and I mean very) ending to this book, which I really wanted to know more about:  When I started reading this book I thought that this was going to be a classic. But after reading all the way to the very end and not finding any of the answers I had been expecting, I started to get pretty discouraged. Even though there are some very good parts in this book the overall experience is really lacking.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst of the lot was " The Magic World " by Robert W. Chambers. The author was a well known author ( The Necronomicon ) but this book was a complete mess.  This book was the worst of Chambers's oeuvre and not even the worst (the best was "The Last Wish" from the same series).  This was a good thing for me because I found "The Magic World" not to be worth my time. The main character (who is a wizard) is a total asshole and he does absolutely nothing wrong.  He just wants to get a powerful spell and uses his connections to blackmail and manipulate people into letting him do so.  Also there is a lot of gratuitous sex, violence, and death in the book.  It's not a bad thing but it does not help. I gave it a 1 star because of the gratuitous violence.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As someone who read the audiobook, it's good. But a poor book, IMHO. And I liked the audiobooks of the books by John Ringo. That's just me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I have to say this is a very, very bad book. The characters are really flat. It's obvious the author has never written a book before and had to get some writing experience from somewhere. I mean the whole "Sara and his dog" plotline is so bizarre and unbelievable it's funny, I know. It was a good plot to have. But this book has a number of glaring holes in it. The main one being: Sara's brother has a girlfriend? What the heck! Who the heck is the sister? The other main one is the weird "spouse" thing the author gives to the main character. Why would a guy be attracted to a girl, if she doesn't like him? And if he does, he shouldn't have to keep talking to her, should he? The plot is so silly, and it's not even particularly well written. But the character development in the book is what makes this book so bad. I have trouble reading characters like Sara's family. They're so wooden. Even if they are supposed to be funny, it's so hard to laugh at. They don't have any personality to speak of, and that's a big reason for why I don't think I'll be recommending this book to anyone. And then you have the whole thing about Sara being gay that the author tries to justify in a way that I can't even believe exists in real life:   Sara had never thought about it in those terms, but there was no mistaking that he wanted to be accepted for who he was. "He told me he's gay," Sara told him when he asked her out that first night. "I thought he was just a straight guy who wanted to do the things that straight guys do. I thought he'd get in trouble and run away when he told me." "Do you think that makes you straight?" she asked. He shook his head. "No," he said. "Does it make you a lesbian?" She shook her head, her face pink, her mouth hanging open. He tried to answer, but it came out as a mumble. She finally said, "Well, I like girls, and I like guys. But they don't like me either." He couldn't stand being treated as though he didn't have a choice. It felt cruel. And it made Sara think about it again, and again.   You have to wonder how the author was able to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read. The author's style is so dull and uninteresting. He just wants to tell you how bad he thinks you are. I could have saved myself so much time by reading someone else's opinion but I found nothing about this book interesting enough to read about. I can't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a bad story that makes no sense and is boring to read.   It should have been called "How a bad guy is saved from the grave" instead of "How he makes a deal with the devil."   The ending is bad, especially the death. And the main character is a loser and a jerk.   a good review:  We were really impressed with the quality of writing. The author wrote a very good story and we are looking forward to reading the next book in the series.   in my opinion, "I am a Devil" is the best book that ever came out of the paranormal genre, that was written in this century.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's like having sex with a dead body.    "He had sex with that girl."   This is a story about a little boy who wants to grow up to be a man, so he tells his friends that he's going to be their "little brother". He meets this woman, whose name is Mary, at a bar.  The story is about how she falls in love with him, and their sex life is a little odd until their baby is born, at which point the story gets a little too weird.  If I had seen this in a book store, I probably would have been disappointed.  However, it was a fun read that I did not give up on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (this book is terrible) This book contains many things that are terrible. One is the horrible way a girl who is about 5 years old is abused by her father. The father is so mentally ill that he has a hard time controlling his temper. The worst part of it all is that he kills the little girl with her own bare hands, and he does it out of pure sadism and fear of what his daughter will do if she gets out of hand. This is one of those books that I would not even recommend if the author were alive because it is just disgusting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very boring and not very exciting and you won't get all the cool characters that are there in this book, I think it is too long to be a good book and maybe there will be more coming but it does not keep up with the action of the story so you just wanna see it end 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I love the characters, but this is a very uninteresting story."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't. It's not an enjoyable read. The narrator is bad, and her voice is forced into the book. I can't get behind a book that has a person who is in love with their boyfriend telling her she's making him feel bad, only to tell her the same thing about her boyfriend and be horrified.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the last book I picked up.   I am so glad I read this before it was too late, it was a good book.  It was just hard for me to like it.  I will never buy another book from this author again because I feel he wrote a bad review.  This book wasn't too good and a lot of the events took me out of the book to be a fan, and didn't make sense to me.  In the end he just didn't have what it takes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed the book, and found myself liking it more as it went along. It's a pretty funny book, but the author makes some pretty stupid assumptions, and at one point he implies that there is an invisible but very real, and very annoying, "litterbug" on the loose in his town. The writing style is so different from the book I read, but is entertaining and funny enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a classic case of "the first book was good, the second was average" (read The King's Blood by J.K. Rowling), but I just cannot find any redeeming features. It's just a mess of bad writing and poorly developed characters. For example: The only one who can be considered a good character is his mother, but that's mostly because she's a little weak-willed. Even then she's the only character who has any agency at all.    A woman's role in society is often limited to that of a wife and mother.    It's a woman's responsibility to take care of and raise her family, but if she fails to do so, a lot of her life is taken away from her.    The men in this book are all weak, not strong. Their women seem to have the same problem, except that the men of this world are the ones who cause it.  This book really just feels like it's taking place on another planet that I never wanted to come back to.  I think that the most irritating thing about this book is the fact that, for the first half of the book, we're treated to a ton of action, followed by a really dull section where the world just seems to stop. There is not even the slightest hint of what's going to happen next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was good when it was good.    I was very excited about this book, and got excited about it, so I was disappointed in the end.  If you like fantasy, if you like female characters who are strong and independent and not victimized, and who have good and bad things happen to them, then you will enjoy this book.  The author did well in creating a setting that was different than anything we have seen. The magic is different. The worldbuilding was well done. The characters are complex and well developed.  I enjoyed the characters, though I would have liked to see more of the worldbuilding and worldbuilding-by-committee. It felt a little like one big story where I could have loved each chapter.  There were a few times when I really thought the author was done with this world.  In a review I will say this, the magic system is a little clunky, but I do think it is more than a little unique.  One of the things I liked about this novel was the idea of the magical girl army.  It allows a group of characters to act as a cohesive unit, with a common goal and goals that they are willing to take on when the time is right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was so frustrating.  It started out well enough but the way he kept getting the same material over and over led to me getting bored.   There were times where I had to force myself to finish a chapter just because I wanted to get to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has nothing new or useful to say about the subject and is a hack.   My opinion:  This book is useless.  If you already have a good understanding of how to use an ATM card then this book will not help you.  The reader is expected to memorize the PIN number, the security code, and how to enter the numbers with the correct order in the correct sequence.  Even when the reader is able to remember the PIN and what the security codes are, they are given too little detail.  This is a total waste of time and money.  It's a waste of money because it's not a good book.  My advice is to buy the original book. It's free with most ATM cards.  About the author:  The reason I chose this book is that I thought it would be useful for ATM use.  I do have a bit of experience and it did not teach me much.  A basic understanding of the ATM card does not help one if they don't already know how to manage and access their own ATM.  Another thing is that the reader does not know what a PIN number is.  He may think PIN numbers are some kind of security code.  In reality a PIN means that you know the security password. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, but I didn't read it in 3 days. I read it this morning. I would definitely re-read it, but don't plan on it in my future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "For a book about a white man, the book lacks nuance; the author gives a full frontal view of how he thinks and acts. But the real trouble is that he is also a white male in a position of power, and his views don't really come across as those of a black man. It makes for a great story but it doesn't help a lot in the world. I enjoyed the plot but the writing was awful." – Lola-m  "What is the most important part of a novel? To me it's the characters. It's always the characters that make a novel. The character you love is the character that you write down, but the people you hate are not characters you remember. I think the main thing in a book is how people react to each other. It always begins with the characters: it's their flaws, their strength, their weaknesses, their love or their hate. You know what the hero's weakness is and you know what his or her strength is. You start with these people and then you get into their inner thoughts, their hopes, their fears. How they react to a situation is what makes a novel." – Anonymous  Click here to see this book's table of contents.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   .   I was not impressed by this book.   This book is not a mystery.  In a word, NO!   In most cases, a good mystery or a good thriller has an ending, a mystery has no end, a thriller has many different endings and in a way this book seems to do the same thing:  It has many good endings and many bad endings.  As a mystery, I had high hopes.  It is a good read, but as a thriller, I would say it is not good at all. I found some of the endings really disappointing and I didn't understand what had happened, but at least, the mystery was solved and there is one happy ending!  I just found out there are two other books that follow the same characters but in a totally different way.  The last scene of this book was quite sad, but the best part of the book is still to come, which is yet to come!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say that while I was pleasantly surprised by this book (to me, at least, it seems to fit into the genre) the book did not live up to the hype and so far, in reading it, I can't say it lives up to this hype.   It is a great read, with some funny parts. But it is not a fun read (that's the word I'm looking for), at least for me, because the story itself is really, really dull.  But it isn't just a bad read; there are parts where the story just gets so boring it's ridiculous.  The best part of this book, however, is that the author managed to make us think that something is wrong with one of the characters, but it's not him.  This book does make you feel for the main character, but you don't like him (and I know I am not alone in this, as I thought he was a good character, and I hated him a lot) and when I think about him, it makes me want to rip his throat out (because I hate him too, but I love his character development).  It may seem a bit long (probably around 240 pages) but there is a lot of interesting stuff that happens in this book.  A book like this should have a sequel (I hope, the author has written one already), but for now, you can read this book on its own as a very interesting read. I would definitely recommend this book for people looking for something entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very bad book, and one that was just too good to be true.   This book will make you sick to your stomach.  "This book is a series of horror stories that tell of a couple of sisters, one of whom is possessed by a spirit, and the other of whom (because of her faith) can actually talk to the spirits, with the result that the other is constantly being chased by one or the other. The author is an American author of a horror/thriller novel named Lisa Yee who has written the novels Ghost Story, The Dark Lady (which features a witch) and The Black House (a book about a family dealing with a possessed house) for the big company of publishers that seem to have found the 'hook' on selling these horror stories to Americans as the 'fairytale' genre."   I have read the book, but have never even heard of this author or these books.  This is the third book I have ordered from these publishers, and have not received any books. I will be returning this book with no regrets.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not good. The writing was awkward, the plot seemed rushed, the romance was pointless, the story was poorly developed, the characters were weak. There were things about the story that were interesting and others that were tedious and irritating. This book did not deserve a 5 stars for this one reason: I did not want to finish it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm trying to get back into books, but I've really had my fill of books so far. I started reading this one by John C Dvorak and loved it right away. My only problem is that it's a book that's supposed to be a "young person's" story, but it just didn't have that appeal to me. It also seemed to lack the feel of a "teen" book. That's why I'm not sure if I'll continue reading this series. I'd give it a 3, maybe a 4.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of this book was the fact that this book has a title so obvious. The title of this piece of junk was written by the author. The story revolves around a bunch of characters that, though completely ridiculous, make a great story. In the middle of the story, the author attempts to write about a girl who is being forced by her father to be a prostitute in a bar. The entire time, though, she is trying to convince the man she is with to stop their relationship. But her best friend has a different idea. The girl is forced to have a baby, but is she doing it right? I thought the ending was a bit contrived. In a way, the way things are left out of the book were meant to make it seem as though the author thought that it was a very bad book. I was kind of disappointed. Overall: I really liked this book. It wasn't that good a book, but it was still a good read. It did take some time to get going, but once I did I was really interested in seeing where the story was going to go. I do want to give this book 4 stars instead of 5 because the writing of this was really bad. I did enjoy the story and was entertained. I think it would be really interesting to see if there is an update on the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read all of the books and have read this in a long time and i was very upset and frustrated with it. I was so disappointed with the characters that we have to watch and listen to get some progress. Also the main character was a terrible person and i hate to say but she was not good at writing. I'm not a fan of the story line and not at all a big fan of this book but this was really just a waste of time and money.    Rated 5 out of 5 by KJ12 from A great read! I really enjoyed the book and thought it was a great change of pace. It was a good start to my summer reading list. I had high expectations for the story but ended up being very pleasantly surprised with it all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You read the book. You know the plot. The book is boring and predictable. The author's pacing is terrible. The characters are terrible.   The author didn't even bother to write an introduction.  It would have been more fun to read a review about how I can't stand this book. I have been struggling with mental illness for 10 years, and this book will only add to my confusion and sadness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book, and found it to be extremely unhelpful in it's portrayal of the subject matter of mental health.   A book that describes mental health in such a very clinical way as well as the effects of mental illness, is a good read but in a book like this one, it feels like they were trying to make a case for how much of the depression is psychological and how much is mental illness.  I know that the subject of mental illnesses is not as common or well researched as it is in other areas of the world.  It has also been well stated that this book is written by a man who suffers from severe anxiety and depression which is a very different mental illness to the ones described in the book.  For the most part though, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the subject or just enjoy a funny read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After having a couple of other good reads (and some not so good) I was really looking forward to this one. I was hoping the "dark" side of this book would come out in a different manner from other books I've read and it's not, so I can't recommend it to anyone but my family (which I don't care for).  I'll have to check out the book a third time to see if I can find a negative aspect. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read many of their books and I always say the same thing:  The cover is bad but the stories are good. This one doesn't meet the high standards I have for a good sci-fi book.   The stories seem to fall apart on thematic, cultural, political, and technical grounds.  I'm also annoyed by the lack of details about the aliens that are revealed in the end.  The story is actually somewhat engaging and entertaining though, with some very good and suspenseful parts. I got the book from a charity sale.  It came packaged in a nice hardcover with a glossy cover.  This was the one of the first two releases I bought in 2017.  I don't think I got the right edition, but I am using it anyway.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book about a dog. The writer writes like he is trying to be funny, but it just comes off as a really lame gag that just gets old after a while.   I hate the fact that this book was self published and it has all the classic literary conventions, but I can't deny that it is actually pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was a problem with this book. I read it and I was not impressed. The characters were not well thought out. Their personalities did not come through very well. Their motives were not clear. I did not like that the characters and their families had no connection. I would not recommend this book to someone. I'm going to try to get more of their stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book for about an hour. I have never given a bad review for a book, but this one just seems like a mess.   The thing is, there are parts that are very compelling.  I love the way the author describes the way that the book could work, if it had more detail or if the characters would have more personality.  It is a good book.  Unfortunately, the rest is really awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In general I think this is a good book about a very complicated subject and one that would benefit greatly from an author who could go into greater detail about its philosophical underpinnings. It's probably not a book a serious student of metaphysics would want to read for a test.   The book opens with a very nice discussion about what a good philosopher is: an interesting question, I've always wondered. But then the author begins to discuss whether an individual philosopher should get a job or a job title. What is a philosopher? Is it someone who works in academia, and if so does that imply a position on the academy? A philosopher should work with a professional group in a professional manner, and a philosopher should do something else if they don't want to be a philosopher. The book has an odd premise - it is supposed to be about how a group can have a very different conception of what it means to be part of a group than a member of the group. The result is that the book is very boring, very confusing, and very unclear. The problem is that a good philosophy is really hard to come by. One reason we know so little about what makes a philosopher a philosopher is because we don't get many of them.  So in general I'd give it a 3 out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible.   I'm glad I found this book, but I really, really dislike it.  I feel bad for all the people who like this book (even though I don't love it, I still hate it) because the book is so bad and unoriginal.  The main characters were basically just random names, names like "Cathy," "Jane," and "Sally."   In addition to these, there were some women that were also named Sally.  There was one woman who had a "Nurse."  There were also some women whose names didn't start with the letter "S."  Even the plot, which was completely nonsensical, was completely predictable.  A couple of characters even mentioned other characters that they knew had bad luck.  And finally, there was even one character that said they liked the book and were going to buy it. I don,t get why this book was written as "The Most Lame Book You've Ever Read" and was a big hit on Amazon. I'd hate to see people that really like this read it.  I think it's time to stop buying books with titles like "The Unlucky List" and "The Lame Most Loved Books"  I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you like the book, and the author, but don't enjoy reading this book, then you should also skip it.  Review:   What the heck is going on in this book?!? In a world where every creature of every species on the planet can speak, why can't they learn how to speak the same way? We're in a world with no shortage of odd people and odd books that I've always found fascinating. Not that I'm some sort of expert on the subject but even my average college textbook has plenty of oddities and mysteries within it that I haven't yet been able to solve. Why do our brains have such a hard time figuring out the basic rules of the universe? And is there anything that I could do to help? I don't have a special talent for figuring things out, so what exactly is the point of this book? I was hoping to find some new insights into human language development but all I found was an enormous amount of confusing writing. Not so much to knock this book (which is a very good book) but to point out that you have to be extremely organized and meticulous when it comes to researching a book before you even begin to read it. It makes perfect sense to me that the only reason that we don't all have an A.A. for human language is that we'd all rather spend our time having sex and playing dress-up than memorizing something we don the night before. (My only other complaint is that I have a hardtime remembering who has the last page number on the back cover)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm an avid reader, but have only read a few YA books this year. I was looking forward to reading this one, but unfortunately I felt like it was poorly written. The character development was awful, the story was predictable, and the plot was lame. The author spends a lot of time explaining what she's going to do before she does it, and is constantly putting characters in the same position, then having the other characters react poorly to their attempts to resolve this problem. For the most part the author's explanations are accurate, but the characters can be annoying at times and don't really seem to have their own minds. I would have liked more development for all the characters in this story and more character development for each individual character as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * I gave this book a two-star rating because it was so long that I found myself yawning.   And while I enjoyed the book's focus on character building in the absence of plot and intrigue, there were so many points where it would have been nice to see more of.  For example:  How did he know that the people he met in prison were good people?   It was so obvious that there was a purpose to his visit:  He was trying to convince them that he wasn't as cold and cruel as he made out, that maybe he was a good guy who just had to take time to show it to everyone.  He should have just left the door open for more visits to show he cared about his people and not just to get his point across. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's bad enough as is... The characters (especially the main character) are dull and one-dimensional, the setting is cliche and cliché, the romance is lame, and the setting was done really well only because of the "fate" it serves. Even though it is written in a fantasy setting, it is still a lame fantasy book. I have read far worse than this and I think this is my least favorite, which is saying something, considering that it's pretty much all I can think about. My rating:  I gave this 4 stars (and really enjoyed it) but I think I'll have to re-read it. I think the setting and world building was better than I originally thought.   This is one of the more recent books I've read and I loved it so much I bought the ebook. It was fantastic.  What can I say? This book's not bad. It's not amazing. It wasn't particularly good. But it's a book I enjoyed and that's more than I can say about some books I love. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure if I will ever find a good book that is as good as this one. I feel that every chapter could have been expanded, the stories are well-paced and well-written, and I don't know why the author does not add more characters to the book (like the one who goes out to visit her mother's grave).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping for something fun and interesting. I found it very interesting, but just not for me. This is not a book that I will purchase again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not have a basic knowledge of the Bible. It is a very poorly written, poorly researched book. The author has taken the same information and interpreted it a different way, and it really takes a while to get through all the things he says. If you are looking for a Bible book that has good content, you will not find it here. This book is a waste of money.  The Good: It has a good amount of content: there are over a hundred articles, mostly focused on the early days. The best part about this book is the author's ability to explain things in a way that is readable.   The Bad: In my opinion, this book's primary problem is that it is filled with uninteresting stories and a lot of misinformation. The Bible is not like a book on how to be a good Christian (which this book aims to be).  If you are new to the Bible:  I don't recommend this to people who do not know much about the Bible (I don´t consider myself a good Bible reader anyway). The content is not well explained, there is no background on any topic, and the explanations of some points are not clear at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an example of the "sad and funny" format. There is a lot of great stuff in this book, and the "bad" part is probably the most overstated in the book.   A great book by a great writer.   This book is a well written story, it is written in the style of a true detective story, in a modern day setting. I don't understand why it is called a "classic" because it is not the classic detective story. The story is told in a way that the reader has to go back to the beginning to get everything out, but this story is very good. It is written for adults, but it doesn't have many sexual references and the story is not too long.  I really enjoyed the story, but the ending was pretty weak and the book ends with a cliffhanger, but I guess the story will have to wait for a sequel. I would recommend this book to any detective fan, but not for everyone, there are plenty of other excellent books.  If you liked this review, don't forget to sign up for a free trial!  I've got an interesting theory about this book that might explain the ending... and perhaps some other things as well. I am very much enjoying this book. The author does an excellent job. If you love detective stories, this is a must read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was just starting my vegan journey.   Although it started out good, the book devolves and falls apart.  I understand that it is supposed to be a vegan cookbook, but there is so much wrong with it that it really becomes hard to like.  This is my 2nd book by the same author and both have turned out to be terrible.  First,  this book starts off really well,  it has some pretty good recipes.  They are good enough to make a good meal.  However,  I feel that when it comes down to it, the author doesn't know what she is talking about.  The recipes  consist of ingredients which are either not vegan or just not healthy.  For example:    3 eggs:  I can't think of a single recipe that would include 3 eggs.  Even if they were vegan,  the ingredients  are so heavily processed   that  they are unhealthy.  There are no ingredients like almonds or avocado,   in the recipe.  To make the eggs taste decent you must add in some oil,  or dairy,  all of which would be impossible if you actually cook the eggs.   1)  The author   gets a bunch of things wrong with the recipe:   2)  To get this recipe to work, she says  to cook the beans in a crock pot on low for 7-8 hours or high for 4-6 hours,  then  shred them into a fine powder.  These instructions would require you to either do a huge batch of beans, or shred them in a food processor, so it would be easier.   3)  As for the bread recipes, she recommends making a gluten-free bread.  She recommends using this flour and only these ingredients:  2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 tsp salt 1/2 tsp baking powder 1 1/4 cups warm water 1/3 cup white sugar 1 tsp cinnamon   In her gluten-filled bread recipe,   she only uses 1 1 tb gluten-less bread flour and uses 2 Tb sugar, instead of the 3 1 Tb in her original recipe.   4)  She has a weird recipe for mashed avocado.  1 can of sliced green avocados, mashed with 1 Tbls water 1 Tbs sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1 1 Tsp baking powder and 1/5 tsp garlic
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * This is a good book, but it is more of a thriller and less of a fantasy. It is great if you're looking for a good, classic fantasy/sci-fi novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not worth the price and I found a lot of contradictions. I felt like the author was using the book to get a quick pay check from the university (the book was not well reviewed and the university accepted the payment.)  For some reason, this book was only good for a few pages. It then takes an ugly turn where the author tries to prove that we live in a very misogynistic world.  I do believe that some of my male readers would find these chapters very relevant, as I know some women do feel this way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure if this one is bad in any way, but it's a huge letdown. It's a great mystery but it never feels like it has anything new or compelling. I'm really hoping that it does better with a second book in the series, as I was really enjoying the first.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, you would like to give this book a good review because it is fun, and it has been recommended as a good book.   And that's because you are reading a fun book, not a boring book. But the problem with it is that it's not a good fantasy book.     If you really wanted a fun fantasy book then this might be a good choice, but there's not enough fantasy in this book. The whole story is based on the book " The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe " (included in the movie), which is not a fun read. The story is so unbelievable that you start to see how it is like that. There are several characters from the book who just seem to come out of nowhere, and they're all trying to save the main character. The main character, who goes by the name of "Rune," is in the process of becoming a "fantasy warrior" so he can do battle against demons and other creatures (which sounds great but I did not find it as exciting as the original book).   The story does not have enough adventure, romance, magic, or anything else to keep you entertained, and the main characters all just have the annoying habit of turning on the main hero at the most inopportune time (like when they want him to go to the pub, but they want to drink with them instead).  The main characters.  This story is also a bit of a downer because the main story doesn't really work for me. The first half is a bit too fluffy, and even the third half had me wondering why the main protagonist even had a character, because the character development is lacking. The second half is kind of hard to follow because the story just becomes predictable. It is hard to see where the story is going and where it will end up. So much of the book focuses on the characters trying to get through the last few chapters without the main plot being revealed. I would have preferred a novel that didn't focus so much on the story, or that focused more on the magic and magic items. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book, I enjoyed the story.   The characters are a little shallow, I wish they were a little more real and a little less cute.  It's like someone was trying to be funny, but just can't figure out how to do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book interesting, and the author clearly understands what the main problem with the book was. The book does not do a good job of covering the issues.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. I can't say the same for the book: I loved this one. There were some moments where I wished the book had been shorter, but I do love the idea of a time machine where you're traveling from a certain time period and then go back to a later time period. The plot is very original and interesting and there's an overall sense of wonder about the workings of time travel and what it takes to make it work. I liked the book's premise and could envision my own time traveling stories. It took me a bit to get into the story and there were some parts that didn't completely hook me, but the story was good. I do feel that the main character is a bit underdeveloped and his relationship with her father wasn't explained very well. It is mentioned that they have a daughter together, but it's never clearly explained whether or not her father knows about this time travel or whether or when she might have been separated from her father. I guess that's one of the things I liked about the main concept of the book. It's a little hard to review a book in the same format that the book was written in. It was written as a journal of someone traveling backwards in time and this journal is a sort of computer that can only remember certain things. So the book took place on various occasions in different years and I felt that this format really allowed the book to really shine. There was a lot going on, but there were no large gaps. I do feel it was a little long, but what matters is whether or no you like the main concepts, the time travel, the concept of time, or the character development. I think it's a very interesting concept and I'm glad I read it.   I thought the book did a good job explaining time travel in an exciting way. The main character was interesting and her relationships with her mother and father were interesting. I like time travel as it has a good sense of adventure. One of the more interesting things about time travel is that it's possible to actually "remember" the future, so it was interesting to see what would happen if this person actually got into the future. 5-star rating:    I liked this one a lot. The main character and some other people are traveling back in time through a small town in the 1800s. They end up having to deal with the problems of people of the past who are
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I wish I was kidding.   The title of the book is misleading - as a self-help book - it's about how to not be like that, that you need to learn how to become more like yourself, not that you are a defective person that needs to be fixed by the book.  It has a good start - I had read a lot of self-improvement books in my life (I'm not the most productive person in the world) and this was one of my favorites - I thought there was a lot about psychology and a little about biology.  - It's really long (it's longer than most self-publishing books), and the author's way of making sure you are on the right track (by using lots of case studies) is somewhat cheesy and irritating - this book can be good in an academic setting, but in everyday life, you will find more value in a book like The Six Pillars of Self-Improvement.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem with this book is that it was written by a "self-confessed" fan of Star Wars. While I have no issues with the books of this author that have been written in the past decade, this book really felt like a cheap ripoff of SWTOR. The author has obviously made the transition to a writing career that is more about money and marketing, and the book itself is not only terrible but unreadable as well. There's just not much there to keep the book from being just an ordinary fanfic. The only redeeming quality of the story is that the author managed to find a plot in an otherwise worthless book. It's just so obvious and blatant that the character's love interest could not possibly be any other way than a non-sapient alien/alien-human hybrid. The best part of the book is the two-page quote on the back, so I won't go into too much detail.  I have not read any Star Wars novels, so there was nothing new to discover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending is absolutely atrocious, and so, so cheap. The characters are flat, the plot is flat, and the story is flat. And what does she actually get for doing this. I'd love to see a more elaborate plot, but the ending is just stupid.   I can't read this book.  Why do they have to do a sequel?  And why is it coming out in July?  I have to look at the front cover to figure out what it is about?  Does it tell me to go buy this, or does it not tell me anything at all?  No, it's not about the second book, but it would be interesting.  Maybe it's about how she came to realize who her true love is.  Or is that the wrong question?  (She is too smart to fall in love with a boring guy)  I don't want this book...  I want a continuation from the first book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a ton of good information in this book, but it is mostly useless. I can't put a price on the information and it is often missing. The book contains more than enough info to solve many people's problems, but only a few people will ever use it. It would be much more helpful if the book included a complete solution for each problem. It really should have had this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters in this book are a bunch of whiny, self-righteous bitches who believe that their religion is the only true path to salvation. They also feel the need to tell everyone that they are going to be rich and famous and live like King David on a yacht for the rest of their lives because they have this special power that they need to find. These people have no real purpose other than to make the rest feel guilty about not believing their lies and believing the world is only about them.   This book is really hard to sit through. It was definitely one of my lowest rated books on Goodreads.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The book is a waste of time, and more importantly, it's a waste on your time.   From the synopsis: "I have a hard time with this book. The protagonist is a young woman who is being forced into a difficult marriage to a man that she knows is cheating on her. A friend of hers is a priest and she's desperate to get out of the marriage."   Unfortunately, this is the first in a series that I will read because I just don't think I have enough patience with it.  As mentioned above, the main character is forced into marriage and her only escape is to pretend to be a man for her husband so they can be divorced.  The book has a lot of scenes where she has to lie to her husband. It's ridiculous. It makes me laugh but then I wish he would just marry her and have the kids. She's not that crazy and I know a lot more men who would be able to handle their wives in their 20s, but I just wish her husband would just leave her and find a new wife who doesn't have a crazy sister.  If this was about a woman, this would have been a lot funnier. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a huge fan of science fiction/fantasy books, but this one, written by a man who was never a fan of the genre but was somehow influenced by it, is bad. I've read some other books in the same vein, and I've enjoyed them, but not this one.   " The world is being devastated by a great flood which is caused by a gigantic meteor that has crashed into the world in a violent thunderous explosion. People are buried alive and it is said that the world will be uninhabitable for another thousand years. And if you get to the surface of the earth, you won't find anything there except one man - who is not really a man - because his entire body is hollowed out by an ancient evil that has been sealed in a coffin.  The man was a wizard, but the evil inside him sealed his soul to the body, and when the man died, it sealed his tomb, and that is where this novel takes place.  As a whole, the story is kind of a bummer.  "This guy's got a lot of guts, and he has the means to stop this flood and save the world, but he doesn't do it. So he ends up becoming a hero, but in the process, he loses his soul and then his body."   It's hard to tell what the book is about - maybe it's about saving the world?   The author does not have a lot going on, but there's something there, and the writing is good and he tries.  But the plot is just a mess - the story starts out with a lot happening, and then it goes nowhere for the first half of the book.  It sounds like a really interesting world with a good magic system, but no, I really wouldn't care to live in it, and you might too, if you think it's a bad story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited about this book, especially after my previous reading of the book. It really has made me think about a lot of my own biases and prejudices when reading certain topics, and have made me more aware of how much of the society I've grown up in can be downright reprehensible.   There is a lot in here about racial prejudice in the United States, which is not necessarily surprising.  But this book also focuses on the cultural and political aspects of the various religious groups, and especially the various Christian sects, which are, in many ways, almost diametrically opposed in terms of beliefs.  The Bible, for example, seems to be almost exclusively about a love affair with a woman, and the Book of Revelation talks about hell, while the Koran is about a person who is so filthy he must have been a slave and who was born of a prostitute.  I don't know if the authors intended this, but they certainly make it seem that way, in a manner that feels at times incredibly mean and condescending.  Also, while I can understand a desire to have a more diverse cast of characters in a fantasy book, I find this to be a little bit odd to have the same characters all from one religion, as if the author wasn't really sure which was which.  Finally, some of the arguments in the book feel like over-exaggeration and wishful thinking.  It is difficult to take this seriously because the author really doesn't seem to care about having a balanced view of Christianity, and I think the book has some serious issues.  As I said, this book was interesting.  However, as a whole, it wasn't a particularly good read.  To begin with, it's difficult to really understand the religious differences of some of these characters.  Is it really as easy as "religion is a very complex thing, and some religions are like that, while others are not"?  It seems to me that, for a lot, it really is very complicated.   On the other hand, I think it was important to make this point, even if I disagreed with it.  So it was really good for a fantasy novel to show us people who are religious, or who have religious beliefs, and to try and understand why they are that way.  And, if it is a religion that is "all or nothing" in a lot sense, as most religions seem to be, then we really
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I would give this a 0/5 if I had written one. I had a good time with it but this isn't it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even like bad books.   I've been through this.  When I was a kid my mother bought my brother and I a lot of books. I don't know what I thought of them other than they looked like fun and they weren't that expensive.  My mom read a lot and I used to get to read too, I think I read two or three books a week. I didn't realize it then, but books are one of those things that get used up and have little value.  I read this book yesterday and I'm so glad I gave it a chance.  It's not a classic and it isn't the most challenging book, but I still loved it and it was a fun read.  The book starts off pretty strong, with a protagonist who is searching for something and who wants to know about him or herself.  We read the first part, the first few pages, before they begin.  He goes to see a psychologist, who tells him about his own experience.  And he tells me that I can too.  They then go into a car and drive over to the site that they find the information at, which turns out to be a real place.  This leads up to a conversation about what to do next with the information.  At the end, the protagonist tells a few lies in order to save face.  That's all I'll say about the beginning.  After a while, he realizes his deception.  But what about the later part?  The main character, the one who finds the information, is a bit of a jerk, but still pretty interesting.  Her backstory is interesting too. I think the main plot in this book was a lot different.  There are no major twists, no backstories.  What we get is more of a story of searching, learning and dealing with what you've learned in the last twenty years of your life.  One of the things that I really liked about this book is that it makes a good "bad guy."  The main character has a lot to learn and is a little bit of an idiot.  Like someone who's gone through a lot, and then is learning about his life from someone else.  I know that's not the main idea here, but it works well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author was a very smart guy with a great sense of humor who was a good writer. The book was a great introduction to the ideas of evolutionary psychology that he is best known for.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very bad read: I got the idea to read this book because of all the rave reviews, so i figured I would give it a try, but I wasn't expecting anything good. I got a very bad feeling about this book and when I finished it, it was like I was reading something I hated. I am sorry but I hate bad writing and characters that are nothing more than stereotypes, but that's what I got. The plot is very silly and nothing of what it is saying makes sense. It is so rushed with so much stuff happening and all the characters have a reason to kill off the other characters, there was nothing to keep me interested in the story or the characters and I am not impressed with the worldbuilding. I would rather read something new and better. I didn't really enjoy the characters, although they were well written I would have rather liked more. I ended up getting the book but I am glad I didn's because the writing was very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't find this book to be at all entertaining, or even interesting. It was more about the author's own self-indulgence and narcissistic behavior (which I'm sure I am guilty of at one time or another), and not about the book's plot. I read this book for the first time around 4 years ago, but only now got around to reading it again. I loved it at the time, and I think I still love it today.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book I wanted to read. I can't figure out what the point is. I love to read science fiction and fantasy so I bought this expecting great stuff. The thing is, the writing is terrible. I don't care about the science, I don' t care about what the book is about (which is the magic). I think I could have given it a 5-star rating if they actually tried to make the magic realistic, but they don't. The only thing I liked about this book was the ending.   "The first day in heaven is like the first day on Earth." I couldn't get over the fact that there was no magic in the book at all. At one point I asked the narrator if this was true because of all the books I had read where a planet had no magic, and they said it wasn't true in this book. I really thought that this was just a way of making up for a lack of magic. However, I am confused about this because I read something about a magic system which existed on a planet called B-612 which did have magic but it wasn' t a major factor. Now I know that this book is not about B-6, but about B-, a planet about the same size as B-12. I know B-712 is the planet the narrator lives on, but B-616 is the next one. Why would you not put all of the planets on the same scale? I'm just confused as to why they would create this. As a scientist I want to believe that magic exists in a universe, but this is just so lacking in magic that I can' t believe it. Also I just didn't understand why he would want to live on B-5 because that is where all of these humans went and all of them died. And then he gets to live in B-613, a planet without humans. But he has to go to Earth. Oh my god! Is this not a sign that humans were somehow related to the gods?  I have a few questions:  1) How did he make it from B-512 to B-615? Does he fly? .  2) Is B-607 the real home of all those humans? What if, as an Earth-bound being, B-627 can make it to B612 (the B-617 "miracle" planet where B612 is, not the one B
Write a negative review about a bad book:   1. It's a bad idea to go to a bar and find a date, especially one that is going to be with you for the rest of your life.   I have a boyfriend, but not a "long-term" relationship.  I think I'll be with him for only a short period of time because I feel I cannot commit to anything long-term, but I have made up my mind.  My boyfriend is not a big drinker, so I don't think there is anything going on there.  In fact, he seems to be a little too nervous about a relationship, which makes it even more unlikely he'd want me with him.  It seems that the entire point of the story is to show how stupid the concept of "getting in shape" really is.  There's an exercise that helps them lose weight, and the "training program" is to put the "fat" in "fatty" and "muscle" in your name.  The idea that it was a good idea to make someone's life miserable for the sake of a body is laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was extremely bad.   It was poorly written and the premise was laughable and very poorly explained.  Some sections were so badly written that you would not have known the book existed in the first place.  One chapter just seemed to be a complete waste of time, with characters with no depth and not a word of development.  The ending was very abrupt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A boring story with a slow start. A good ending, but the book will have you wishing there was a bit more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was pretty good. There were some problems with the plot, but I think they should have at least given a few more details. Overall, this story wasn't too bad. The writing is pretty solid, the author doesn't rush through the story (which is why some characters get killed off), and the romance is nice (although I don't know how they managed to tie the two in so well).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read to my 3 year old and my 2 year old. After reading this book the 3 year olds weren't interested and the 2 year olds were annoyed they didn't like it and I'm not sure why because it's a wonderful book. The writing is good, the characters are well developed and the way the children are all presented is a very cute and nice way to show that sometimes your kids don't really like the same books. The ending is also a good one, but I thought that it could've been done better. But for an overall good book, I give this book 4/5 and a 3/5 for the children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It doesn't contain the depth or intelligence to be considered a great book. In my opinion, it's about as good as any of the Harry Potter rewrites. I do recommend it to anyone interested in fiction, but it won't impress anybody.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's attempt to create a historical account was, to say the least, very disappointing. He uses a very small number of primary sources and some of the names of people from the time he quotes. For example, the primary source for his biography of Winston Churchill is a book titled "Churchill - His Life and Times". The book has nothing to do with Churchill and even has some errors.   He claims that the "Great War" of 1914-1918 is the second major war in history (after the Thirty Years' War) and is a major war, but it isn't. There were multiple major wars in Europe in the 1700's, including the "Italian Wars". However, it is important to note that the Second Italian War of 1796-1799 was a war in which the "Fortunate Duke" Joseph II was actually defeated and the "Ruler of the Netherlands" Charles I was murdered in 1797. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book before I started this project and was glad to learn it was actually an old book. It was not difficult, but it is one of the books that was written in the 60s and 70s. It contains quite a few mistakes that make the book hard to read, and I learned some of those by looking at the book cover. But I was glad I read it anyway, because it gave me a great overview of some common types of sex education in the world in the past.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was really hard for me to get into the book, as the author, Robert Boyd, did not give enough attention to the various aspects of the story, so that I ended up having a very poor understanding of what was happening.   The beginning of the novel was a little confusing, but the more I read on it, the more the mystery made sense.  As I was beginning to feel I knew what was going on, the mystery was revealed to me in such a way that I got so many clues to the mystery, that I didn't even know if I was going to enjoy it anymore.  I ended the book in a complete mess, not knowing if I made the right decision to buy this book or not.    The cover of this book really caught my eye.  The title is pretty good too.    This book is worth the money, if you want to try out some of Boyd's writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The "novel" has a plot of "fantasy" where a girl who has been kidnapped, tied up, and tortured is saved by a female warrior and together they go into a battle against a giant monster who can "read" human thoughts. Then, just as soon as the book gets going, it starts having it's head in the sand. Not one problem was addressed, there was no plot, there were no resolution to anything, and the "hero" was a total wimp for being a little weak for not being a good fighter and so on. But most annoying was that the book was never really funny, there just wasn't anything funny or engaging to say in the book. If you're a fantasy author that wants to get the fantasy market back on track (like me, as I said) and is in the mood for another self-contained tale of fantasy, then maybe give this one a try. If not, it's a waste of your time and mine. If the next book in the series is any good, then you can expect a series of books which are better, and there is nothing to complain about in the first book (the only issue is how there's not enough of it).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book two stars because it's a good book, but it's way too long and drags on way too much. I am only going to give this book three stars because the plot is excellent and is a better example of a time-travel book than the Time Enough For Love  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After being in a relationship for over 15 years, I found a guy I liked more than anything. We went on some amazing adventures, and even bought a house together. But then he decided to cheat on me. When I realized this, I was devastated. I have now learned to forgive and move on, but the fact that he tried to manipulate me into getting back together is still so saddening. And the story just ended...   -  I'm ashamed to say that I never liked this book because I thought it was too boring. My favorite characters (Lloyd and Harry) were all on another planet, so I couldn't relate to them or the plot. But I liked the setting so much that I kept reading it and found out some other stuff that I like in the sequel. This is a book for sci-fi nerds who love space and time travel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book on a lark because I wanted to read a good one. I really hoped this book would be something different. I was wrong. In fact, I think I'll never be able to read another book by JRR Tolkien. This book is just so boring. There are things in it that I would never be interested in reading, just because of how long it takes me to understand them. It is too many chapters, with lots of backtracking for me to get to the most important bits. There's no real plot to speak of, just lots of talking and very little action. I kept thinking this book was going to be different. That is how bad it is. I don't want to think about reading another one by Tolkien. I want to forget about the Tolkien books ever being written, and move on with my life. If I ever read a book about him, I'll read it, but I just want to get on with life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book at all. There was not even a hint of what the author wanted to achieve. I feel that the book was written by a non-fiction writer who is too caught up in her own ideas to care about what the reader may think about the book. This is not the first time a book of this type has been written, and I am sure the next version will be different, but for this book it was a failure and not worth the time it took to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure how many people have ever read this book, but in spite of the title, it doesn't really read like a book.   The plot is convoluted and is a bit boring, and if it didn't have the title I would have thought it was a novel.  At the very least it is entertaining for the short period that it has, but it's not a very good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book based on a few reviews I found online and decided to give it a shot, but it wasn't until I started reading the story that I started to really have issues with it.   The plot follows the lives of two brothers who are members of the "Buffy" gang.  They go out on adventures, meet interesting people, fight bad guys and have fun.  The problem is that they have the same story arc over and over again.  I can relate to this.  In the beginning, I had fun, because I found it interesting to see how the boys came together.  But as the story progressed, it became really hard for me to be interested.  There was very little development.  Although the story is interesting, it is a typical teen angst story and was never really worth the money.  Recommendation:    Do not buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was skeptical at first when I bought this book but after reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to give it a try. The book is written in a very easy to understand and entertaining way. The characters and plot are good but the writing is somewhat over the top, which is the reason I gave it 3 stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts out rather promising: "In the year 2055, the United States of America has just finished a two-year war against a brutal enemy, the planet-destroying and life-destruction-creating Extraterrestrials, in which the government and its allies managed to destroy or capture almost the entire Extratrerestrial race. We find out that the Extraters have managed to escape to another dimension called the Black Hole. And since we can't go there on our own, there's one thing we can do: Go on a journey to the Black Holes of Earth and find out what's been going on there."   The first half of the book is all about the Extravatars, their origins, their motivations, and the Extraradoid race.   While this is a good first introduction into the Extraverse, the author is rather vague about his intentions:  They were sent here to fight a war, then they went off to do it; they're not even sure why; they'll probably fight each other to the end.  We're told that the BlackHole is a "place where a thousand worlds are created out of nothing" and that "there is a new world within this. It is not the same."  And then we find out why.  The "real world" (in the universe we're reading about) is being invaded by a race of beings that have no souls and that are, themselves, completely dead:  As the story progresses, the Extraworlders discover that, somehow, the Blackhole's inhabitants have developed a technological form of telepathy that allows them to "read the minds of the Living"  (i.e., the Extradiators) and to "confront the threat of the Extravehoids."  The BlackHoles are, the story says, "a world of living people that has been taken over by an alien race, which is now controlling its society and using it as a means to invade all of the real world and other worlds as well."  Thus, the whole book is a metaphor for the Extracellids:  We learn how the Extralords have "taken over" the real-world governments and taken their "power" from them by force; and how they have been able to keep the real governments under their control.  These events are, of course, all true;
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " This is a sad book. Not because it is sad, or because it has a sad story. Not at all. Because, it has no plot. No one is a hero, or a heroine, or any of the other usual archetypes. It's about an annoying teen who doesn't know what he's doing when he tries to kill someone he likes. The "I love him" bit is so annoying. "The other plot device the book is built around? That is the main reason the book isn't great. It doesn't have a hook. Nothing exciting or memorable happens in the first 50% of the book. Then something good happens, but the reader isn't even sure how it happened."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and thought it was a great story but unfortunately it ended with it ending but not quite. The book ends with some great writing but not nearly the full story. The story was okay but I wanted to see a little more. It just didn't quite feel like what it was supposed to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a total fail. The book is a very simple text about the importance of "receiving" rather than "giving." My husband and I started out with some reading about how to help others. I liked that she brought up the idea of "giving" rather "receiveing" in the book because I also am very giving. But, after the first chapter, we stopped reading it because she didn't have a very good way to show people how to do things. For example, I could have given her the idea that the most effective way to "re-gift" to others is to read what they have written. In other words, I have to read a book or article for the person and then make them laugh or do something that is funny and then give them a gift. Of course, she has a way to make this work and I would have liked to see her use that technique in the rest of the book. But I can't really say that this book was of any help because I did not find this to be an improvement over her book, The Give and Take Way, because there were still things that were not helpful. For instance, after one person had done something good, I expected her to then take something from the person's bag to put back in it. Instead, she just put some of the gift out in the hallway. She also did not mention that there is a lot of money to be made when you donate a good. This book is not going to be a life-changing book, so don't waste your time on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book.   I loved the ending, but I do have a couple problems with it.  Firstly, it seems like the author took her own advice about getting a job, and got an internship at the publishing house.  It was not until halfway through the book that she made her presence known in the office.  She really made me wonder if she was there to help with some of the book's story line, and not to write it. And it was kind of fun to read her journal entries about her job, but then it got old because I had to read it for two books.  I do like the ending though!   If you are going to write a book about the business of writing, maybe write the entire book first, and do the job interviews part later when the book is done?  And maybe it would be better if the journal entries were at the end of the novel instead of at the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not only horrible, it is also a complete waste of your time. First, the narration is terrible, so bad that I was even reading the book through my computer's speakers to listen. Then, the book's premise is that the main character is in an abusive relationship because of her gender and her sexuality. This is both an awful and sexist premise to have in a book, as if to say that this book is about something. It seems like the author is trying to use the abuse as a way to further the story by telling you more about the abusive relationship and its consequences. The end result is still an awful book because the story is never given the proper treatment that a good story should get. This book has the same plot in a different setting and a different way of telling the story. I feel that this author should be ashamed of herself for writing a book with this type of premise.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My mother-in-law has some great books ( I still have hers ) but this one is NOT on her short list. It takes a while to get going and the story doesn't really "get there."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off ok. I liked the idea of a magical girl that would wear a costume that makes her appear to be weak and stupid. The problem is she is not. She is actually a pretty decent and strong magic user and the way the series starts I did feel that she was on the same level as Harry and Ron in the first books, except she isn't a muggle born witch (at least not yet, but I was hoping for something like a real life Voldemort and all that) The series itself is pretty solid and I liked a lot of the characters and the plot, but it really is not what I wanted or expected.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:     After reading the description I was a little worried that the books was going to be really boring, however it turned out to be totally entertaining. It's so sad that authors can't use science to back up their claims. We already know the earth revolves around the sun, so why would the author want to waste so much time on the Earths axis. Even if the earth were spinning, why would one bother to create a rotating planet when our entire existence revolves around this one? The author also tries to make some good points about the existence of the sun by saying it is the source of the universe, but that statement doesn't make sense. The earth isn't responsible for the sun because it's spinning on a plane that is tilted. And that's only one of many problems with the book. The author uses the word 'humble' too many times and this makes me question how much he truly understands about the subject. This is the author's first book, and he must be a great student or he would've realized that his claims about the sun are ridiculous.   In conclusion: If you like science fiction, read this. If you don't like science, you'll still enjoy it, but you won't like it as much because you will question his claims. If your looking for a book to give you a reason to believe in God, look somewhere else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as I was looking for something more interesting than the standard adventure book. The character development was good, although I found it strange that he didn't become a mage (and apparently he couldn't because it's the only class he had). The action was not thrilling, and the characters, while interesting, were too two dimensional and stereotypical. This book will not get my final grade of a 5, because I am looking for some more action and more depth than the basic "save the world" concept this book tried to sell us.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is quite clear that the author has read "The King in Yellow," but it is not clear what he got from the book. The book has many flaws and I think the author needs to read about the horrors of the Holocaust. Also, it has no place in the realm of horror. It just has too many problems to be accepted as a valid horror tale. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for a college assignment.   It's really not a book you'd find in a college library.  I think I could have done without the fact that the first chapter was on a guy who had a brain tumor and it was explained in a very dramatic way,   it really made no sense and made no reference to what was going on   What bothers me about this book is that they actually had to explain this man having a brain and he's getting an operation and then later on he's given a drug that helps his tumor shrink away,  but at the end of the book he gets the operation and it ends with the same guy getting back to normal and the tumor grows back, but it's explained this way like a dramatic story,  it's not really a story in any way, shape, or form.  It seemed like the author didn't really know what they were writing about.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book would have been very useful, had it been published in the late 60's or early 70's.   It is full of half-truths, mistakes, and un-documented statements.  It is not worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read "Ender's Game" with great expectations, but what I got instead was a boring and poorly written book that doesn't hold a candle to "E.L. James'.   A lot of the problems stem from the author's apparent inability to write well.   The best part of the book was the opening chapter, when Ender is a little kid and tries to imitate his favorite toy.  The way that author used that opening was great.  I thought that the way Ender's books are often divided into sections of three, makes the author very boring at times. I didn't mind that part at all, it was just the opening that bothered me.  There were a lot of confusing things in this book, such as: Why did Ender have the same face in the book and in the movie?  I wanted to find out the answer to that one.  Why is the boy wearing glasses in the first three books and then he takes them off in the last two?  Why are the other kids wearing clothes and then in the third book all the children are wearing the same clothes?   And then there was a big mess in the end: Why does Ender get so many friends and then why doesn't he get any friends in the final book?  This is the most confusing book I have ever read.  This may sound like a lot, but the last half hour of the third novel, was a total mess, like every chapter felt like it was trying to tell a different story.  As for the books themselves, they are good.  They are definitely good for younger readers and adults and I enjoyed them a lot.  However, I would recommend this book to all people that aren't into the "Harry Potter" series.  It may not be what you want, but it will be fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author made an attempt to use the concept of "ancient Egypt" in an ancient Egypt story, however the author is not very creative or creative at all when he wrote it, making a complete mess of the story. I don't believe he understands the concept behind the concept and how it is used. The entire story is a mess with the author not understanding the concept at all.   A book that's good for kids:  This book is an amazing book for the entire family. My 5 year old daughter had to pick up some of the ancient Egyptian history because the book was so much fun to read. If I had to give this a star, it would be a 2 star for some of my grammar.      In summary:  The story is good, but the author did not use the ancient Egypt concept at the right time in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad, and it is full of typos.   It has little to no story, with the main characters being one or two people that get into a car accident.  I found the book to be confusing and not very well done, and the book was not in English.  The plot is also pretty pointless as a vehicle for the main character to discover his own identity.  I'm going to be straight with you guys; this book sucks.  While it's not really that bad; it just doesn't really do anything new with the characters. It's more like a new set of characters that you've got to know who to be with, but the rest of the book is just setting up what will be a really boring series of events, and not even a good story. The book also suffers from being kind of boring as well.  It's not bad in any one area, but in my opinion, it just takes away from the story, which is kind of a shame since this is supposed to be a very good novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish this book was a little more about the personal side of the military and less about the war itself.   The main character, Private Ryan is a hothead and can be a bit unruly to some people.  However, when it comes to his job at the front lines, he is amazing.  This book is just about Ryan and his life in the Army but I can tell it has been greatly influenced by the book called The Devil's Brigade  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book but it was too confusing and had a lot of random information for a non fiction book.   The only thing I learned is how to make wine without a winemaker.  The other book I used a lot was the one about the people in the war zone where I lived. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I have a problem with this book, it is that I had to put in quite a bit of effort to put my opinion of it together.   The book is a mix of fact, fiction and imagination - a combination that can be hard to get right.  It's an interesting study of how the brain's ability to adapt to change in the environment can be used to solve problems.  The author seems to be very interested in the differences between fiction and fact, and I liked his interpretation of some of the most fascinating and interesting cases of what we call "reality."  However,  it is the science that I was most interested in and have a lot of issues with.    The case is fascinating but the basic facts of how they relate is a bit hazy.  This has a lot to do with the science itself.  I know it sounds like I just dismissed the book, but the book is based on many case studies where people were tested using a variety of different tests,  so I don't know how well the science is tested.  One case was one that is based off of the work of William James, who proposed that people can change reality as they see fit.  He proposed that as soon as people believe something is "true" they can begin to change it.  James suggested that if they are told that they are in a dream or that a picture is a representation of a person they can change it and even see it as a person - but only for a brief period.  If they are not told it is a person, then their interpretation of reality is altered and they don't change the picture.  But that is not all that James proposed.  James proposed that if people are told they are being tested for a disease, they may become more accepting of their illness as they feel like they are doing something good and helping.  So, in one case the disease is imagined, in another it is real, and in the third imaginary.  In all cases the patient can change their perception of reality, and even change their opinion about the disease, if they want to.  These experiments are done over and over again, over and again, and the changes in perception of the person is measured over and so on until the result is shown.  How people can interpret reality as it is presented to them is what makes the work fascinating to me.  For example, I don' think I can remember the exact test
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a bit disappointed with this book. I think it's a really good idea, however I felt like it was rushed and a little too much exposition was given (especially in the last quarter of the book) to make it seem like it would be better than it really is. I do understand that you want to present a different side to the character as well as the conflict. Unfortunately, the characters are a little dull and the conflicts are really very few and far between.  The main character is in my opinion a great main character, however, her conflict is extremely weak (especially with the first book in the series). There's very little action to be had with her conflict, and it really seems like we're not given enough background on her and her conflict to feel anything for it. I didn't hate the book, but I wasn't overly thrilled with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not been able to finish this book, it is boring and I think the author really doesn't know what he is talking about.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really like this book!   In a world where I always end up hating most things, especially when I am supposed to be a strong character, I feel so lucky to have this book in my collection.  I would never have been able to get through this book without constantly smiling and wanting to tell the author to do a better job.  It's one of those books where I felt like I was reading a great novel by a real living person, as opposed to a fantasy novel by someone pretending to be one.   And one more thing:  In the second half of the book, I felt a lot of sympathy for the little boy who lost his hand to an old man.  This makes for the greatest of stories, one in which we don't have to feel sorry for the characters, or blame their actions on an unfeeling god, or think that there are no good people left in the world, because all good people have to die or lose their hands.  Instead, we can just feel sympathy for their loss and make them into people we can look up to.  There's something about people who get lost in their own misery that's just so appealing.  There you have it, folks.  And, since I'm a fan of reading about other people's adventures in a magical world, this is a book I will always have on my bookshelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem with this book is that it's trying to be a detective story while also trying to write a historical drama, as it is about the life of the Queen of England and the man that she loved, King James I. It's not a problem in and of itself, but the way it is structured makes things worse, as in each time a historical event happens, the book jumps around, to King James' reign as Prince Regent and James's reign as King. If I remember correctly, this was supposed to be about two great men: the monarch and his heir, and the young man whose life was so important to both. The only other thing about the book that is particularly interesting is its reference to the "Marian Reiss scandal." In a few places, this makes its way into the story, but in general, it seems a little out of place. I liked the story a lot, but I had to put it down to work on other books, and then it came back for me to read it again when I had the chance. Recommended for fans of historical fiction who also enjoy history and historical fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bit repetitive (especially when the characters are in a bad situation) and some things are predictable (i.e. a character who always makes the same move).   That being said, it's fun and it's well worth reading for some great plot twists and suspense, though I did not enjoy the book.   If you're a fan of the "Fantastic Four", I would recommend this book, though you might have a hard time finding a copy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. I didn't read the book before I purchased it, so I couldn't tell you how the story went from book to book. The story was a very good mystery, however the characters in the story were very shallow. I was especially confused by the main characters relationship with an individual who they were trying to find guilty and then, later on, they found out he was innocent. He should have been dead at the end of the book. Other than that, a great book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does not impress. It is a collection of short stories by various authors about people and their lives in the 80s and 90s, with no real relation to each other. Some stories are really good, some are really bad. If you're looking for something a little out there that you'll laugh at, then this book is for you. The problem is that it has some really good stories, but the stories are so bad that the reader will not be laughing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A hard book, with some boring plot.   But it will stick with you and leave you thinking.   "I thought that the book was interesting and had a lot of information. The book didn't go far enough with some details, like when the writer first heard about the book he was trying to write and his experiences in writing. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing that could be said about this book is that the ending (not being as terrible as I had been led to believe) was an ending that I was willing to accept for the sake of the story. I think that the rest of the book was really just a collection of bad choices. The characters, including some of the more sympathetic characters, were a real mixed bag. The dialogue was so bad that I often felt frustrated reading it, and the author's decision to break up the narrative into sections meant that the story felt disjointed in places, like a book in which a paragraph is missing. I don't remember anything from the part that involved the boys, but my memory of what happened to the main character and her sister is very hazy. I am disappointed, but only just.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, the book is an awesome book. This is my first attempt at writing a review and I must say, this book was really good. It was also one of the more complex, interesting, and fun books I have read. The main problem I had with this book is that it is really, really long.   I loved the book but if it were to be divided in to chapters like so many other books in the genre, it would be much better.  This is a good book, but really not as good as other books I read which are much more enjoyable to read.  It took me a lot longer to read this book than I thought it would but I liked it and I think it is definitely something I will recommend to others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to get ahold of him for a review.   At first, he said "No comment," but then changed his mind and told me it was really good.      He also said he was a "huge" fan of this book.  But that's not why I bought this book--to read the author's review of it.  I'm sorry to be critical about a book that's actually good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad and badly written book about the life of a little boy who is in jail for murdering a man. The author is a crackpot and his work is based on pure delusion and wishful thinking.   I'm not going to pretend to understand the boy's motivation but he was obviously mentally ill. He was obviously motivated by a need to get out of a tough situation he had been trapped in. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would like to apologize to the readers who liked this book. I know that most of the good reviews refer to the first few chapters and some of them are quite good. However, I found the last two chapters a little boring. As an example, they were about a new friend, the author says how wonderful he is, but doesn't really explain his behavior. Also, the character's reactions and motives are predictable, so they get boring. The book ends with the character making a decision which is really out of character.   My rating:      2 stars   It's one of those books you read when you don't have a lot of time and you really want to know what a person's true intentions are. If you enjoy suspense then this book will satisfy you for the most part. However in the second half of the book it becomes boring. Also I think that most readers would not enjoy this book because it takes a while to understand the story. A good read if you want a good mystery: I like mysteries because they are often surprising and make you think about what happens next.    This book has the best endings I have ever read.  They have a few twists and surprises which keep you on the edge of your seat. It is good to get a new perspective on people who you thought were bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is just a very, very weak "my hero gets abducted and is saved by some random girl" type plot. The ending was very unsatisfying. I just don't see a point in wasting such a good plot on such a crappy ending. I mean, at least in the original book, you can see how the girl has feelings for the boy. She even does something like make a scene to try and convince him. But here it's so rushed and forced that I was just not really interested. I got confused by the whole plot and found myself trying to figure out what it was they were trying to accomplish. If they had just spent more time with their romance I think it would have been a lot better. I also thought the romance was completely unnecessary.    11 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to the last book in the series (a sequel) but that was canceled before the first book was published. I read that there would be some sequels but they seemed to be delayed, or are still in the works. It's a sad commentary on the quality of literature.   This is one of the worst books I've ever read, I was very disappointed and I just wasted my time.   This is a book about a man who is trying to find love but fails miserably. This is one book that will make your heart ache and it should be avoided.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a girl named Tashia who's having a hard time with life. She meets this guy, the 'Ruler', who tells her she can be the greatest person she wants to be, and then tries to destroy her. There's also a bunch of random people who get killed off and/or get killed at the hand of the Ruler. That's about it. The book doesn't actually make sense and there's no real plot that I can tell you what's going on. I guess I'll give it a pass because it's not a very good book, but the whole thing just made me want to rip my hair out and run around screaming in anger. I think I could only tolerate this one episode, but it wasn't worth my time or my energy. It just makes me hate everything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The novel has great characters, but the story is poorly structured, poorly written, and badly plotted. This is a very confusing book that ends up being about three different groups trying to find the hidden artifact. The first group, the Amarr, is led by the head of the organization, Kirel. Their first task is to find some artifact which Kirele believes might be an "Exclusive Material" that can be used to unlock the power of the other planets. The Amarr's leader is very confident and arrogant, and their entire mission is based on a hope that somehow they can pull off something that will change the universe forever. Kirea is really a bit of a jackass, but I like his character because he's one of the few human characters in the book and he's a bit more complex than the other characters. However, when I first read the book, I knew the novel was going to be hard to figure out. And I mean that in the best way possible. The second group is led directly by the Emperor, who is trying to harness the energy of the wormhole and keep the galaxy stable. This group is not very smart, and they are too stupid to realize that Kirella has some sort of plan to find their artifact. While I still enjoy the Emperor's characters, the plot is a little hard to follow, and I felt like the story was just getting bogged down with a lot of background details. The third group, led by a person named Naelo, is trying something a little different. Naelog, Naelon, and Naelan are all Amarr slaves who are running a trading company and trying to figure a way to get around the worm hole. They are a little more believable in my opinion, but they are still hard to get a handle on. The fourth group is headed by a character named Eliza, and she's a warrior woman with a grudge against the wormholes and the Amar. I like her because she's not stupid, and her character is complex and interesting, but again, I feel like this book had a hard time coming together. Overall, I liked the characters, and liked the writing and the story, but it just felt like it didn't fit well with the setting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As you can tell, this book has nothing to do with me. I am a fan of Star Wars and I've watched the original trilogy numerous times, but this book is just not very good at all. It's a poor follow-up to the first novel, The Princess and the Queen and I'll be disappointed if any of the characters I like in this book have a chance to live out their heroic, daring, and brilliant lives, even though I'm always intrigued by them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. The writing style is very clear and easy to read. There are some parts that are a bit too much for my tastes but I still thought it was a good read.   Overall this is a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The worst book ever written. It is like a big fat bad idea." - The Geek's Guide to the Galaxy (a.k.a. John Scalzi's book) "The worst?" - George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones "This?"- The Chronicles of Prydain "A?"   "I?" "This...?" It takes a lot of effort to make a bad work, and then the author of that work doesn't even try to do much with it (like me with the old book I just bought, which I gave away before I read it, but which I may just re-read now). This one is not even a bad bad work - I can't say that at all. It's just a badly written piece of crap that is probably one of the best books in the genre, even though the author, the first person narrator, the characters, the plot, and the dialogue are all bad and terrible. It doesn't make much sense - I haven't read much of fantasy fiction - it's a weird, post-apocalyptic world that's completely devoid of magic, and a little bit of science. The characters are strange - they live in a world where almost all the humans are evil and dangerous, and all the animals are pretty much docile. All the humans have to do to get food is to go to a small village and buy some potatoes from a small peddler and sell them back. It works for a day or two until the potatoes are stolen, so everybody in the village needs to hunt down potatoes. Then they have to go around the village and make it clear they bought them before the thief can steal them again. Meanwhile, the other characters all try to figure out how the potatoes got stolen and how to get them back again. It sounds like it would work very well as a TV show - just with all the people trying to figure it out. The only problem is that most of the characters who could do this have been killed off. There are also a couple of other things about the world that I really didn't care for - the village has a magic tree that gives people dreams and wishes, but you can only use it on yourself. The villagers don't use it - they just stand there and feel happy (and I think the author was trying to say something about their lives, but it's so awkward and weird that it doesn't come across).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know what to say about this book. I really really liked the book. The book was interesting and I liked the cover art and writing style. I do have to admit that it was very confusing for me. I was supposed to read this book by the end of the book but instead it took me 3 whole days to read it all. I know it's not all that important to read the book, but for me it would be great to have this kind of writing style and writing that had the potential to be good, but got lost in a sea of words. I did enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book's title is "The God of Small Things" which is a pun on the name "The Big Things" and the book is a collection of short stories written by the god, and the stories are very short and are mostly about his struggle with loneliness. The stories are pretty dark but also very funny. The book is about an unhappy god, who is really just a sad guy who gets lonely, and tries to cheer himself up with a little bit of faith and good fortune but to no avail.  The only story in the book I felt was pretty good was The God of Good Fortune, which was the most optimistic story in that book. The other stories seemed to fall into a pretty dark, dark mood with an overbearing god that is a bit of a jerk and a lot of them were just plain old dark. The god of the story is a really lame character.  The main character is very vain and selfish and a dick to everyone and the main character's father was a bit worse. The main characters is a pretty annoying and shallow character. I found him very annoying, and I couldn't help but to feel sorry for him.  I didn't enjoy the story about the little creature named "Ziggy" very much either. The story was about a god who doesn't care about little Ziggy, and this god is so selfish and mean that it kind of made me sad.  There were some really horrible, stupid, and just plain mean scenes in the story. This God of small things was probably the worst God I've ever read in a book and probably the most shallow I've read in any book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1.0 Good:  0.0 Bad:  1 This book was one of my favorites growing up.  I can't imagine having a friend of such high intelligence write anything that wasn't a masterpiece of word play.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -I read this book and got sucked in from the very first chapter. The book is not exactly a classic and has a lot of faults but it is a nice story and it gets you hooked. The first couple of chapters were fun to read and I really enjoyed the first couple. But as the book went on the boring parts of the story kept getting more boring and the parts I really liked got less and less interesting. The story of the little girl and the boy getting caught in the woods got boring to me and there was no point to the main character. The whole book was really confusing and not very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character is the most pathetic I have ever met. His backstory is so boring that I just wanted to punch the poor man in the face. Also, I don't understand why he couldn't go out of town and stay with his father.    It has been a while since I read a book this bad...   This book was just plain boring.  This book made me feel depressed, but it was also enjoyable!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think you are in the wrong field. I read this book thinking it would be one of those funny books about a small town and how the main character is the local idiot.   What I got instead was a book about a group of people in a small community who are in some ways similar and in other ways different. It's about people in their 20's and early 30's in their hometown and their feelings about how it's changing and about where to go in search of the "next big thing".      I liked the characters the best and liked the humor. The book was a lot of fun to read, though it took a while to get going.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't really explain why it sucked for me, but the plot, though compelling, was really uninteresting and boring. I did like the characters though. A lot of these things could have been resolved if they had at least made an attempt to do so.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't recommend this book enough. I don't have many books on my shelf at the moment but this was one of the first I looked at for a book about the internet. It's a simple book about two guys who want to be like their favorite TV show, "Battlestar Galactica." One of them is called "Baldman" (a nod to the original "Bastard") and the other is called Baldwin (a reference to the popular "Buffy" character). The first one ends up getting a cybernetic chip implanted in his skull, which is just as the show depicted, but the second one wants to be a badass by making his own cybernetic suit instead, which has some very interesting implications. The guy in the book has a great cybernetic head, which looks a lot like a giant computer head, and it's very funny that he's still called a "weirdo" by some of the other characters. His wife is also a nerd, and so are the other main characters. They're all smart, but they're all very different. This book is very funny, it's got some great plots and some great characters, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it takes them. I can see this being a fun read for everyone who loves the sci-fi/comedy series, "Star Trek."
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I have seen several bad books in the past year or so, most of them made for very low quality media. This one was no exception. The writing was pretty good, but the main problem was the characters. They were mostly stereotypical and lacked any depth. The "hero" is just a poor man's Superman (a guy who thinks he's a god, has no problem destroying a city with a single punch). The female lead is even worse. She is just your everyday prostitute who just happens to be the one to seduce the main character. The book's only redeeming feature is that there are a few plot twists and interesting things happen that didn't really work out in the end. The end result was just a mess. I will give it 3 stars, but not because of the quality, but because it was fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's the worst book I have read in my life. I got into reading a lot of books because it's the only thing I'm good at in life.   This book is not only boring but also full of typos and bad grammar.  I have never been this upset about a book. I'm sorry I went with the idea that a book I would read was going to be good. This is a total waste of time.  It has nothing to do with the book at all but the author wrote the book and the book got made and it was never read by anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book in anticipation for my new year's resolutions.  I was a fan of the first book, but thought it was a little too serious/grimy/dark.  This is a sequel but is not the same.   This one was way too serious, too dark and had WAY more blood and gore.  The setting is that the vampires have taken over a small town and its been turned into a vampire stronghold.  While the first movie had some blood and action this one has way too much.  They should have kept the humor.  As a movie the main vampires were a little bit too scary.  That said the sequel is good.  Its not perfect but its got some good action, a nice romance and a fun story.  All in all a fun book to read and great for a vampire fan.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not really the book I would have been looking for!    I would like to have read more of his work.   What I learned:  "   This is an entertaining book.  It's easy to read but has some interesting historical tidbits that will keep you interested." - Michael J. L. Lang, "This book is good."   "   It is a fascinating read.  It is very interesting to know how so many people can agree to an international treaty at such a late date." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband and I both loved this book. It was funny and interesting, but the writing style was so bad that you felt like you were listening to someone say the most nonsensical thing. My favorite characters are the two girls, so I'll give the book a thumbs up!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is no fun in this book.   This book should not be read for the entertainment of other people.  This is a story about one of the world's most brutal dictators, a man so cruel he would kill off a group of his own soldiers to keep one member alive so he could torture him.  If you like a good torture story this is the book for you.  It is well written, the torture scene is really hot and the ending is satisfying.  But if you have no interest in this, then it is a pretty boring book. Not enough depth of information about the man who created this country, history of the Vietnam War, not enough information about politics, no biographical information about him and a few others in this country were murdered in cold blood to keep the man alive to complete his evil plan.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed with this book. It's like an entire year of school gone by (that's really the only way I can put it), and it's full of plot holes, confusing, and poorly written. I was under the impression that it would be better if the first book was taken out (or if someone was given a copy of the third book to write a "fanbook" for), but that was just a really bad idea (especially since the third was the weakest of the three, but it wasn't bad enough to actually warrant a "bad" rating). The premise was the usual "boy falls into a monster's nest and is rescued by a brave girl with wings". Well, that sounds great until you start reading, where the story devolves into: 1) "they meet and fall in love"; 2) "she leaves him"; 3) "he saves her"; 4) "happily ever after"; 5) "her friends want her back"; 6) "everyone's dead" and "they get back together"; 7) "what's it like to have super powers"; 8) "it's a trap to trap them" (or: "they're all the same"; 9) "this is the end"); 10) "you win/they lose"; 11) "is that it? no? good job, bad job". Then they get married and have babies; 12) "then they have another baby"; 13) "and another and another and...". This all just keeps going, ending with the usual, and predictable, "we'll see each other again".   "My review is spoiler-free, so I'll only add a few things about the plot holes. They were minor, but they were still major enough to affect the plot: First, if the book really was a year in the life of a boy and girl, why didn't he or she notice a gigantic hole in the roof? Then again, the narrator isn't in class when the monster comes down the hole, so maybe this wasn't so big of a deal. Secondly, why did the narrator give the wrong ages (they're 18 and 18)? That just adds to the confusion. Third, why is everyone who knows about the boy, including his parents, so happy for him? The narrator says that he's a little boy, but isn't he the one who has to save the girl? Why isn't she happy for her? What
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As I got older, I found myself reading books where the protagonist has some sort of mental illness, only to be completely disappointed that the book was about nothing else but that character's illness.   I can only imagine how much time and energy the writers of these books put into them and couldn't get much out of them, either.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "  ...I am in love with this book. I have been wanting to get through this book for a while now, but every time I try, I keep getting distracted by some other book or TV show, and this time it is just the same old boring story with no real growth.   I will be sure to start my collection from this book and move forward."  About the author:   This week I received a copy of Richard Powers's "The Book of the New Sun," from Tor.com. I can't believe how much I love the series. I love Powers's work so much that I wanted to reread some of the older books. "The Shadow Throne" was one of the first I read back when I was in college and I remember feeling absolutely nothing, but a strong connection to the character. The first volume of the series I read is called "The Emperor's Soul," and I felt this character really resonated with me then as I do now. I am so excited to read "The Last Will and Testament" next.  The only reason I waited so long to pick this up again was because I felt it would take more than three books to fully understand the background and plot of the story and, unfortunately, that is the case. I'm going to read these books and see how it feels.  is a collection of the original novels in the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. It is a companion volume to Jordan's two-volume set The Gathering Storm, and is divided into five parts. The collection contains the entirety of The Eye of the World (or "The Great Hunt" as Jordan calls it), The Shadow Rising, The Fires of Heaven, Knife of Dreams, A Memory of Light and The Gathering of the Lost, as well as a prologue that features several events from the early books in the series in addition to a few tidbits from the first three books, The Gathering. I think most people will be happy to hear that the prologue does take place before the beginning of The Fires. I've had this collection on my bookshelf since I started reading The Wheel of time so the fact that I have to go through them all again is quite annoying. I started out with this collection and I was quite taken with it. As I began to read, I found myself not as captivated by it as I was by the first one and even the first volume I was a little

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You know the book, but I think this is one of the worst books I've read this year. I know I'm usually a fan of the kind of literature I'm reviewing, but it is just a disaster for me.     The ending is just stupid.    I have a hard time believing this is the final book by an author that won multiple Hugo's and was nominated for a bunch of other awards and was the cover artist of a Star Trek book for ages, etc. It just didn't seem to hit the high mark I was looking for.  I don't know if I'll give it a 0 out of 10 or 1, but either way, I just don't think I'll be looking at it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really hate this book and the author, a well-known author with a large fan base, is an absolute d-bag.   He seems to have a lot of fans and I get the sense that he just really wants to please them and he is not a very good writer.  This was a book he wrote before he did his TV show.  The book was not very good in my opinion but I have a few people who have read this book who loved it. I have not read any of his books so I cannot comment on how good or bad they are. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book made me mad.  I have had a hard time trusting myself to read fiction. I am often left wondering if I just didn't have the patience for the writing. This book took the place of my usual fiction and not only made me question my decisions, but also my ability to enjoy a good book.  It has characters I don't care for and who feel as though they are doing it just to be "cool".  The ending of this book made no sense at all. Why the hell did one person suddenly decide to kill another? How can one person just not care about the people around them when one of them is a freaking monster who has taken lives and tortured children? I understand that these are the stories our parents tell us about the evil characters in their lives, but that's not why I felt this way about this book. I'm not alone in this, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My friend and I both got the same book and read it over night. There were only a couple good lines in the book and then he did all the other "bad stuff" with the characters. I'm sorry I read it, I'm sure I'm not the only one who hates his character. But it's just hard to buy books for the amount of time he wrote it...
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a really good book for me.   I would give it a higher rating than i do on Goodreads.  I've read the book cover to cover and this is my second book from her (the first was a great read and I liked that she was writing a different type of story than many fantasy authors, and this one is a bit more dark).   It's set in a world where the magic is mostly in the hands of men and magic that is only useful for a few specific things is illegal.  However magic can be done by women so the magic system works really well for the story.  It isn't a book about a female protagonist but this is what I like about her.  While there is still some magic in the world, it is mainly a male dominated world and the women are the ones that use it and it really feels like that is a very different experience than what I've seen before.  Because this world is mostly ruled by men it can be a bit hard for a woman to succeed.  In general this feels like a book that you will enjoy reading.  The only negative I can really say about this is that some of the characters don't seem like they have a lot of depth to them.  The book does seem to really follow the main character through her experiences with life and in the end she is still a pretty good character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first two hours or so of this book are a little weird. It's not that the book doesn't do the work it's just that it does it in a different way. The second half was better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that the story was nothing more than the two main characters telling each other's stories.   As a result, this book is just another 'I want to see more of the character I love' novel.  In the first book, the main characters did not make a move until later in the book, while this time they made a move very early on in the first chapter.  I am not sure how much of the book is the characters making a move, and how much is the book's author trying to give them each a turn.  This book does not feel very original to me, and it's hard to remember why I liked the first two books.  The third book is a little better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the book to be a bit boring. Although there were lots of entertaining ideas, none of the characters were particularly memorable. However, the story itself was quite good and the end of the book really caught me off-guard with its unexpected turn-around. This will be a book I will read again, especially since my wife is a big fan of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book I can say that the author is a liar.   There is no actual proof in the book that the moon landings were a hoax.  He made it sound so.  This book is full of lies and the lies don't match.  The author claims that the US and Russia have never cooperated to solve a case of UFOs.  They have!  The reason that the CIA never solved that case? Because the FBI did and it turned out to be a hoax!   In another book he said that we don't need proof because our brains are like a muscle.   He was a liar too.  I read a book and now I know why the man from the Moon did what he did.  What the man on the Moon said to the man who is on the moon, was "The most important thing you have is a strong heart."  This is the author's reply when asked why he said so.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a great book, but it was just too easy for me.   First the prose style of the story was really hard, with lots of jargon and long sentences.  They could have shortened it.  Then the story is told in a very strange way, and it doesn't make sense at all.  The way the character talks is quite different to the way he talks in the book.  It is a very good book, except for its length. If the plot was even close to real, I'd have loved it. I read it over night, and I found it quite easy.  I would probably buy it in a few months if I have the money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a young woman's sexual adventure through the streets of Seoul. The first two chapters seem to be about an average Korean family and the children who are left behind with the mother. The final three chapters are about a group of college friends who spend the night together, with the result that the younger and younger of the girls fall for one another. The last chapter is about their lives together in Tokyo after they graduate. The author has not been writing for a long time, but he doesn't seem to have aged a bit. The book also doesn't have a lot of plot. This is a book about love and adventure, not a book of political strategy. The plot is not much, and the author doesn't go in depth. For instance, the author explains that the women are attracted to one another because they feel a lot in common. This explains the reason why one girl, whose life is very different from the other, falls in love with her, but the author spends very little time on this. There are also very minor character flaws: the author uses the English word "slimy" twice, for example, in describing a woman. This word has a different meaning in the book. Also, the novel starts with a description of Seoul streets, but a lot more is known by the end of the book, and we can't really relate to it, as this is a love story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is by far the worst book I have ever read. Not one sentence that was enjoyable about the book had anything to do with the characters. The story of the "bad boys" who kidnap the president and who kidnap a girl are as boring as the story of those two who kidnap President Reagan. There is a girl who goes in a hot air balloon with two men on the way to Washington D.C. to catch the president. One of them is the President of the United States. The other is a Senator from Washington D (I think) and they go to Washington to kidnap the President because he is the only one who can stop the evil of their friend, who is evil and will make a President Bush. But, the thing is, they don't even manage to kidnap him because the other person in the balloon is the president's daughter, so there is no one to stop the bad guys and get the president back. Then, as a final act, they release the President and give the girl some money, that is not even enough to pay for the girl's food. So, they send the girl off to the desert with two bad guys, without making them wait for her.   The ending was a big letdown. The bad guys get away and the President is left without the power to save his daughter. The girl is given nothing and only gives out some money which could only be used to pay the two bad boys. The only good part about the ending was that we got to see the girls again in the third book, in a more interesting and funny way.  I have been reading this book for two months now, and it is still not over. I don't know what happened to the good things in this book. The characters have become so boring and just the plot is so bad, that the book is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it would be a good book but ended up really hating it   I read this book in October. When I got home, the book was in a pile on my bookshelf and on my bookcase and on the shelf next to the new book that I've been wanting for a while. I'm a newbie to the genre but I wanted to be a part of this fandom for a couple of years. So, I figured, I'll give it a try. This book made me a fan of the fandom. I can't wait to check out the next book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to read a book that has a bad plot and bad characters without getting a bad impression of the author. A lot of authors who write horror fiction are so full of themselves that they don't think about the characters. I've never liked the characterizations of Stephen King, Robert Bloch, or Alfred Hitchcock. I would never read any of them again because of the poor writing in their books. It's not that their characters are bad, but the writing style is often not very well done. I think this book had an okay plot. I have some trouble believing the guy who was going to meet the man on the plane. Is this really the same guy? He seemed like such a jerk to me, but I am not a professional reader, so maybe he is a good guy. He's not a good friend, though, because he didn't care about getting the plane to the destination. We get to know this guy a little bit before the plane goes down, and the reader can't help but feel sorry for him. I also had some problems with how the book told the story. For one thing, we didn't really learn about the other man that was trying to get to the plane, and we still don't know how the plane got on that route. Also, it was very confusing that he would not give the other guy the money and the plane when he is trying to save his family. If I am really being nit picky, there was a lot of weird stuff that I think may have been a plot point, but it just felt kind of extraneous to the plot. Overall, I think I will continue reading this book. I won't say much about it, but some of the story lines have me interested.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has no plot.   What it has is a plotless plot, which means the characters don't have motivations or goals.  The only reason that the main character, Nae, gets to marry her boyfriend, Rufus, is so that Nae can get revenge for killing her sister.  Ruf is a jerk.  It seems that Nane has the most potential in the book, but instead gets the least amount of development.  I also found the ending to be a bit odd.  After everything that's happened to her, her sister dies, Ruzus is a total dick to her and they have to split up, and then Nane goes back to her parents' house and dies.  Overall, I'm not a big fan of this book and I recommend it only for the romance, the last 10 minutes are very entertaining!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a huge fan of science fiction, but this book was really awful, and it did nothing to make up for the awful plot. First, there was a woman who was supposed to be a heroine, who was completely flat in terms of her personality. The writer is not very good at showing emotions, and even in her death scene it was done in a way that made no sense to me. The woman she loves had nothing to do with her death. Her name was "Nancy" and she's supposed to have died when she was younger. I can't even remember her name, because the entire time she was on the ground she wasn't being hurt or screaming, just walking and staring blankly in a completely unemotional way. She had no friends, and the woman that was supposed have cared for her was a bad bitch. Then there's the main character, who just kept saying things like "I will have it." I don't think the character should have even gotten that far. As for the book, it's not that bad, but it was not anything special. A lot of the action was just a waste of space. And I had a hard time getting excited about the ending. A couple of things I did like about the book: the character was a bitch, but she didn't really get a chance to develop. The way she was treated was really interesting. There were some really funny scenes, like when she found her "girly panties" and saw herself in them. I also liked the way that the story ended. The ending made me happy and happy made me sad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the course of my reading of this book, I came to realize the author's true colors were laid bare in her criticism of the book. She used the book as a vehicle to attack two main characters, and in her view, these two people were the main villains in the book, and to further her purpose, she went so far as to imply they were evil in all but name. The characters in this story are pretty generic: the "good" main character was just a bit too naive, while the bad main character (who has more to him than meets the eye) is too self-centered, immature, and ultimately unlikable. She's not as bad as other authors who take this book in an entirely different direction, but she is just about as poor as it gets, and it's hard to take the story seriously when the author is trying to throw the reader a curveball. And the worst thing about this book is, the author doesn't even try to give a "whats up with that guy" or "whos the bad guy here?" story. If you just look at the cover and the synopsis, the book will be easy to ignore, and that's a very bad thing in my opinion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was really bad, I had to keep reading until I got through all the parts of the book. I think the author went through too many people in this book (which is also bad). It wasn't worth my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My friend and I took a class on a subject in writing we both loved, and were supposed to write a research paper on it.  We knew the teacher didn't care for this book, and that the book was nothing more than a collection of the author's opinionated musings on topics she finds interesting.  However, she took it very seriously as a serious piece of writing and not just for its content.   This book is just about the author and her views on a lot of things, and in a way that would normally be hard for a modern reader to wrap their head around (but not here).  We were both disappointed in some of the things we heard.  I find it hard to believe, but I didn't even see where a certain word was invented until I read the whole book.  Also, she takes what she's saying with a grain of salt, and uses the phrase "because she said so" a lot.  Even the author makes some comments that don't seem to make sense, like how she "hates the patriarchy" because she was told by a teacher that she hated men.  If you have any reservations about this book (which I didn t), it's definitely worth reading, especially if you enjoy modern philosophy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only way a book can be truly bad is if it fails to live up to the hype.   What a great concept!   One of my all time favorite authors!  He has a knack for describing everything in an instant!  However,  despite the promise of a great book,  I am disappointed that the book fails to deliver.  I do not really think that this book should be read by people who don't like sci-fi and fantasy stories.  While I liked the premise,  it seemed that the author put a lot of effort into writing the description of the world.  The author doesn't make the details clear and the descriptions are sometimes unclear.  Another criticism I had with this book is the fact that there were a lot fewer women in this book.  For example, the characters from the planet on the planet where the novel takes place were not as strong as the characters I usually see in sci- fi/fantasy novels.  Overall, the writing was interesting and fun and I have no complaints at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down, and I'm glad I did!      I wish I could give it 10 stars, but since I can't I will just give it a high 5.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is an interesting book, but it feels like an empty shell of a book. There is a lot of interesting stuff going on, but you get no sense that the author cared about or knew about any of it.   I'm really annoyed by this book, especially given that it's supposed to be about the rise of Scientology in America.  This book was pretty terrible. It's really boring, but that just seems to be the author's style, doesn't it? I really don't care that much about Scientology, as I don't think it's a thing I need to know much about, but I am just a bit annoyed by the book. I'm surprised by the positive reviews that I read in the other reviews, because I expected it to be bad, even considering the fact that it was about Scientology.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can remember in my first year at university how I wanted to take a long summer off in order to study for a couple of exams. That first summer, I managed to get three, but I couldn't work out what I wanted next to do, so I couldn  This book is terrible! I was given the book because it was recommended as a good book to read for your exam. However, I felt I got a bit cheated in this book. I read this book two days after completing it for my exam and I managed a 70% on my exam. Not bad for two days! The book was completely un-engaging, boring and difficult to understand. The writing is so poor, you can't really tell if the author actually knew anything about the subject they are writing about. This is a book about science and that is exactly what the author has written about. I don't remember learning anything about biology. The book is very confusing with the author using all different types of terms such as "cell", "cells", "protein", "DNA", "RNA", "cellular". The book also has a very poor chapter on genetics that is very poorly written. I felt very very poorly prepared and didn't learn any new information. I did not do well on my final. I thought I would do well because I read a lot and I did. However I managed only a 64% and will be taking the test again. Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about science.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's no way I'll ever finish this book.   I don't have anything to say about this book except that I had to start again from the beginning and that there are still so many problems with this series. I have a bad feeling about this series for the rest of my life. I hate these books.   "Dance, Dance, Dance":   "This is the only book where I've had the impression that it was a series that's been put together by an incompetent writer, or at the very least by someone who couldn't decide how many books he wanted to write. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are two-dimensional, and the dialogue is stilted and incomprehensible."

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I received my copy of the book, the cover did not say what the book is about.   There is no synopsis, no blurb about the author and it has no introduction at all.  The only things on the front of the hardback are the title of the publisher, and a picture of the author. The content of the pages were: 1) the title, 2) the author's name, 3) the publication date, and 4) the book's blurb. I expected a blurb at the end.  I got none. The book's content is bland.  This book does not appeal to me.  1 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book with high hopes, but... I've now seen what happens to readers who expect too much from books. I liked this book, but the book was more about feeling sorry for a child than about being a hero. The book is written very well and well-paced, but at the end, the child has no more of a story to tell.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In fact I liked this book, but its plot is a complete mess.   I can't say for sure whether the ending was the author's intended ending or not but it is an odd ending.  This book is really good but not a complete piece of writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I did not like this book. In fact I hated this book!! The author is a very nice woman and I know it is very difficult for a person like her to write a book that she really, really wants people to like. This book was the antithesis of that. Not only did I dislike the book and the author and the story it was about but the book is bad writing and the characters are nothing but two dimensional, cliché, and two dimensional people. The book was boring and the ending was not what I was expecting. So if you want to read some good books with a strong, positive, heart, you should NOT read this book!!!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, the author attempts to create a story with a female lead. Unfortunately, she just makes things more boring than they should be.     As stated above, the book has a very poor plot. This isn't a bad thing for a book about a female leading character; however, she is a character who's only purpose is to be a supporting character in this story, a main character is the point.   The story follows her and the rest of the characters that do actually have something to do in the story and give their own backstories, even though I would say most of the character development is going on with the male characters in this book.  This author should have made the main characters more important. In a way I have to wonder if this author does have any interest in writing actual female characters; she has written a book where the female lead is an NPC and her only goal is to get to the end of the story. In this way she isn't much different than the "main" male protagonist; both of the main male characters are just as important as the "female lead" and neither are able to do anything significant.  The book also spends a lot of time introducing characters for the male protagonist, but none for the female protagonist and we're never given any reason to like or dislike them.  I have a feeling that there is nothing new to be said about the story; this book was just a waste of everyone's time, including mine.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that I don't like about this book is the poor description of the story. The story is quite interesting, but I have a hard time believing that a lot of the events actually happened. The narration doesn't help either, but since there's no action there's not much to write about. I've only read this book once, and I didn't like it at all. It had some good moments, but was just very bland.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is intriguing and the plot is unique, but I have a hard time sympathizing with the main character. She is a total bitch and is more interested in revenge than learning from the experience.     4.0 stars.   Bridget Foye - What I Got (1996) - I had some hope that this would be good. I didn't know her very well from the series, so that's not why I bought it. I liked the title of the book and the fact that the author is actually an author. I also liked that she took some liberties with the source material, which is good since the source book doesn't have much to offer. Unfortunately, this book was awful. There's no way around it. The main character is so unpleasant that I couldn't believe I bought a book from a book review site where I have to ask for my money back. I wanted to go back and not buy the book because of how terrible it is. And I'm not alone in my opinion.   I have mixed feelings about the book. On one hand, I like her books because she has unique voice and I like that her books take a risk on new ideas. However, I had no fun with this one. I really don't know why she wrote this book. In the book, the main characters tries to prove that she really does have a sister, but it turns out that the sister is a girl in disguise (who has had a miscarriage due to a broken hymen). So now the main protagonist has to find the sister, who has no identity. She wants to find her sister because she's been having nightmares about her and now that the girl in the disguise is dead, she's afraid of her. Her sister has been taken into hiding to avoid having to face justice. What makes the book worse is the fact there are only 2 of the sisters and the main one is in hiding so she's always on the run. I know she's hiding because the author states that the mother of the deceased sister is being protected, but then she's not in hiding because she is in a relationship with a man and there's not much point in her being away. When the main sister does find her and finds out that she doesn't even have a dead sister, the book ends and I just want to throw it in the trash. But then I thought maybe the next book would be better. So I ordered the next and

One of the reasons I'm so impressed with this book is the length--about 40 pages is the absolute minimum, and the author does a terrific job of presenting the material in a logical fashion. I also appreciated that it is written as a guide to deciphering the "lost books" in ancient Rome, rather than an encyclopedia or collection of notes.  I would say that if you are interested at all in ancient history, this is a must read. It might help you to have a guide as to how to interpret the texts (see a few of the books I have on hand) to some extent. If you don't, you will have to do the work yourself.  (review offree book)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, at first glance, is like all the others I've read on the topic, including the books on which I have written reviews, in that it is full of good arguments that you can understand and use to make your own case. After some initial excitement (I am always fascinated to see what I call "the smarts" of a book that has been written), I noticed that there is very little, if any, supporting evidence. It just seems to have been written by a person with a point to make, but no further information or explanation about the point. I don't think I would want to read another book by Dr. Cialdini, especially not a self-published book, especially when the information is so poor that I am unable to understand the whole book in any way, except to conclude that the author, himself, is a complete idiot.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really a joke. The author has obviously done very little research on the subject and has taken a lot of liberties with the subject. It's a story about a gay man and his gay lover who have to make a choice about who they want to spend the rest of their lives with. It has nothing to do with homosexuality, and everything to do about choosing between two people that you would never normally have thought of as being compatible with each other. The whole thing is a big load of nonsense. This book doesn't really have much in the way of a message - it just comes across as one big joke.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are so many problems with this book that I can't even list them all. First, we don't even know where the book is set; how are we supposed to get into this particular world with this person? It's as if they're setting up a book based on a video game (although in my opinion the setting is more important than the person), but the characters are not human. It's like they have to be aliens who have been transformed into animals by some power, which is really bad for the plot. The author spends way too much time describing the plot and the characters, which are terrible. It just feels like the author has no idea what she's writing about or what kind of story she's telling. The book starts off okay with an odd alien species that uses some kind of technology to give them super strength, but in a matter of a few pages it turns into a book about super power, with the only main character that is a woman; and in the end it is all about men getting super power and then getting into trouble with the other aliens. It ends up feeling like a bad video game/book crossover. The main characters are so generic and stupid. The whole thing is a mess from the start, so if you don't have a good story in your mind you can't really expect this book to be any good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (hide spoiler)  What's it about?   [Fictional]... [Fictitious]... It follows a boy and girl, who travel to a village to collect a witch's bones, only to find it in the middle of a town, a town that is currently embroiled in a war. As things spiral out of control, the couple is forced to make difficult decisions that will change the course of their lives forever."  (view spoiler)   I had heard a lot about this book, but had never really read it. I have no idea what the hype is about; a simple plot is being shoehorned into a complex story about power and identity. There is something familiar about the genre: a protagonist, a conflict, a solution... what could go wrong? I'm not sure if I even liked the novel, it's just so overstuffed with a few characters who are supposed to be interesting (in one way or another). I'll give a summary of the novel: a boy is brought to a strange town by a witch (who appears to be a pretty normal person), he learns that the girl is a witch and that her soul is being sold as part of a war, and that the witch's daughter is a vampire. The novel also has several other characters that come and go, which I just couldn't keep straight. There are three plots: a girl's soul is bought from a vampire, a boy's soul (from a boy) is bought (so he can be her boyfriend) and a girl is selling a boy her soul, but it's never actually explained, and the girl also has a very interesting connection to a vampire and some very nasty men (with some nice sex scenes thrown in there, but no more). All the characters are likable and interesting, and I liked some of the twists in the novel. The protagonist was my favorite; she had some problems with her family, but didn't take advantage of them. I think the best thing about the novel is that it's quite fast-paced and doesn't really try to make you think too much about who is really who or why and how it's all connected.  The story: A boy and a witch travel to the village to gather witch's ashes. But when they arrive, they find the town engulfed in a conflict... Written in a simple way, this book doesn't try to be too deep or complicated. A little boy and his
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I found this book a lot of fun. I thought I'd already read a lot about the Civil War (and the South in general) in my college classes but I never knew the history of the South until this book. I really enjoyed the historical aspect of it and also enjoyed the fun characters, but this was definitely not a book for anyone not into history. I found the book a bit pretentious and I also thought that the author had done a pretty good job of putting himself and the story in the Civil war to make it seem more fun than it really is.   My wife and I each found this a bit boring but enjoyed it a lot. It had a few good parts (and we did laugh a lot at certain things). It was definitely more fun to read than to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book in which the author was clearly trying to write a classic, I was very impressed with the originality of the plot. Unfortunately the writing was poor, it is quite possible to figure out the characters' intentions, but I could never really identify with them and the story was rather dull and predictable. The ending was also too contrived and pointless. I wouldn't buy this book. I would, however, recommend that you keep a close eye on your kids, and keep them away from anything overly graphic or violent or that might make them cry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for fun. I really liked the premise but it wasn't very good.   There were a few plot holes in this book (I know, right?!), and some of the characters were annoying. However, I liked the idea that there is an evil that is growing inside us.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * A young girl (11) is being bullied by other kids and is getting bullied by a mean girl. She decides to be mean. She goes to the bully's house and asks her to join her. The girl thinks that the bully wants to be a friend but instead she finds out she wants to beat her up, so she does.   - I read this book for a kid's class and my kids loved it. It had fun characters and fun stories.  * My 11-year-old friend is obsessed with the book, so I bought it for her and I'm going to get the re-read for her this week. She got it for me so we both could try out some of her ideas. I'd have to buy it for my kids too, if it gets them interested in reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so boring! It's so... I am a person who loves books with happy endings and this one just feels so disappointing. I mean, how can one be a detective and find the love of his or her life when a lot of people have the exact same story going on and it's not the main character's fault that he doesn't find love??    Overall:  You have to be a special kind of sadist to read this book. It's a little hard to accept that this is going to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I have read a lot before but that's because I was a teenager when I read this and it was so funny that I read the book again to try to find the funny parts but it's so cheesy and the story is so cliché. So many other books I've read are funny so this one is just sad that the book is only for teenagers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst books I have ever read. The story was too cliché and too cliché, and the characters were so dull, I did not want to read the next book.   I have read so many books on this site and I cannot remember a single one that was this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A pretty decent book at times, but by and large it's boring. I wish there were more than half a dozen scenes that would be truly amazing or really horrible. It doesn't give the story any depth. (If I had to choose a worst character in the book it would be the protagonist, with the exception of one or two instances where she has to make a tough decision that the other characters don't want to make.) There was a really interesting subplot that would have been really exciting if it hadn't been shoved aside as soon as it arose, but the rest of the book is pretty bland, especially as it relates to the overall story. It's a shame because I really did like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the book based on the cover art. I was not disappointed. It did not have any of the elements of fantasy I was looking for, but that wasn't a bad thing.   The book is written by a former magician, who has been running an academy in the UK since 2008. The books are geared towards teaching magic to beginners and there are many practical exercises to keep a student engaged. However, the book is very repetitive, boring, and boring.  The magic is not powerful enough to move the plot forward.  If you are looking for a book for a beginner to begin training with, you may want to look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      If you want something different, you can always read a novel that is the opposite of the book you wanted to read.   What's the point of reading books, if you'll never find the book that you actually want?   How would you rate a book?  In the end, it doesn't matter.  When I'm reading, it's about me.  It's not about the book, so what's the big deal?  If I am reading something, I want to know what it's all about.  5.  I wish that I could find out the exact reason for a certain character's death.  In the end I only cared that it was a real and believable death.   I am glad that I read the book.   It made me think about my relationship with a certain person, and I am a better person for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are some things in this book that would be fine if the narrative was interesting. It isn't. As for the rest of it, I'm really just at a loss.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It started with a great cover and an intriguing story.   But then the story went sideways.  The characters are not believable, their thoughts are often repetitive and there is no real suspense.  And it doesn't stop there.  There are lots of contradictions in the plot that is so confusing to be expected.  I would rate this book as good but if you have any interest in psychology or psychology in general I would give you this book and not the first one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I received a copy of " The Black Dahlia: The Making of the Most Famous Serial Killer in American History " from Amazon to review. I must say that although I really like this book and it will undoubtedly be a huge hit in academia as a "must-read" for academics, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the book itself. The writing is good, the research is done thoroughly, and this book is well researched. I didn't feel like the author tried too hard to make his subject interesting or unique and thus, there was nothing in the book that I could not find on my own. However, I do feel that the book needs to be updated and revised in a lot of places so that it isn't just a rehash of the author's research. The "experimental" aspect of this book, as well as the way that the author was able to "get the ball rolling" on this case was great. The book is great for anyone who likes true crime and wants to learn more about this infamous case. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the case.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed by this book, which is the second volume in a series on the history of the Church and of Joseph Smith. The first volume was pretty good and the first two chapters were actually a good introduction to some of the key points in Joseph Smith's life.  I suppose that this volume, though, is supposed to have an added dimension of "exposing" Smith, as if there's another side to his character that needs to be revealed. The author doesn't want you to forget his "good sides", so he puts all kinds of ridiculous things in the first chapter:  - Smith's first wife, Fanny Alger, was one of Joseph's earliest converts. She was an 18-year-old girl with her brother and two sisters who had been living in Ohio.  - Fanny got pregnant but gave birth to a boy who died three days after birth.   - "Fanny's father, a prosperous farmer, did not want to take responsibility for the boy's child, so Fanny took it upon herself to raise the boy herself. Her husband, an illiterate man, found it very difficult to keep up with her and to support the family. Fanny often said that she found the boy'very kind to her.'"   The book spends a good amount of time, in chapter one, talking about Fanny's life, about what was going on in Ohio at the time. She had two children at a time, two boys and a girl, in a small house.  This is a real problem for me, because I'm sure there were plenty of people like that in Joseph's time. But when the author says that Fanny "took it upon her own" to raise this boy, it just seems so odd.  And if we can take all of the good things about Fannie Alger, I don't see how we can be in favor of her taking all the responsibility. What's the use of a young woman raising a child, then?  What did this have to do with what Joseph was doing in that barn, and how did it relate to the temple? I think it really just comes down to whether you're a believer in God, or you're an unbeliever. I was raised a Christian, but as I went through my own conversion, I gradually came to see the truth more clearly and more clearly began to reject much of the Christian doctrine. And I can think of plenty of reasons why a mother wouldn
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book   I have ever read.   It is not a story but it is a description of a very poor job by a very good writer.  I feel cheated and angry as the book was poorly written, and yet they published it.  My only complaint is that the book has a "feel" to it. The writing style of the story makes it seem as if it is written by an amateur.  You know the feeling...it is a story you can read if you have never read it before. It is boring and drab at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book thinking it was going to be a great book that would help my child who is still learning to read. Well, it wasn't. She is getting frustrated with the way that the books are written, and the story gets more confusing and difficult to follow as she gets older. This was a good book if it were in my son's school, but it wasn´t.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is absolutely awful   It is absolutely terrible   If you like bad books that are poorly written, and if you like making the reader do what you want them to, then you will like this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got into this book because of the premise: 'The best and worst parts of an athlete. The best because of how it's presented, the worst because it feels too contrived.'  I agree with the premise - a story where an athlete has to deal with both his 'fitness' and his 'hustle'. The story was written well enough, but there were too many plot twists.  In order to accomplish a goal the main character has to gain strength through drugs. He's a good athlete, but is he an elite athlete?  I liked the idea that he was getting help from other people. He had a lot of help from his best friend, but it's like they're all trying to sabotage his performance.  I did like that he got more drug help at the start of the book, because I like to see a different perspective.  Unfortunately, this character is a bit boring and predictable (and the whole drug story was too contrived).  I also disliked that the story is told through a book of letters, the stories of the coaches, the 'bad' people that the coach dealt with and their reactions.  Overall, it's a decent story that could have been great if it wasn't so contrived.   The Bottom Line:  The writing is okay, but if I'm being honest it's not good enough to be a great story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The books on this list aren't my personal favorites, but they're all very good books that are at least entertaining.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found a really interesting story, but in the end I felt like the story was rushed and it had no real impact on my view of the world or my views of human nature or any real insight to the characters in this book.  I found myself laughing a little more than I wanted to and had a slight sense of accomplishment and relief when the story concluded. The plot is interesting, but the author never explores it much because she doesn't have the time to really explore it.  She just goes into it and throws everything at you with no clear goals or direction to the world she has created.  The book is definitely worthwhile and has been worth checking out but I feel like the author over did it with this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't like this book.   The characters are uninteresting, the dialogue is dull, the plot is uninspired.    The book just wasn't interesting at all.  The book had one good scene, and one scene where the characters interacted with a lot of people.  It's not like they had a lot to say, but that scene made me realize they were just as important as a normal person in a regular town.  A lot of time was wasted in this novel, but it didn't really matter.  I felt like the author spent a ton of time on this book, but just didn't manage to accomplish anything worth the effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first review for an author I've never read before, but I think I'll give it a good one. I really like the main character (I mean, I like everything about the main protagonist, except her name...), and she's very clever and well written (although the romance isn't too bad, the only thing that really bothered me about it was the fact that the guys had to be around the girls in order to get any kind of "sex"). It takes a few pages to get going but once you do you're in for a fun ride. Unfortunately, there's no payoff for most of the time, but the mystery that's been built up from the beginning is still there.   But don't let that discourage you; this book can be good, I've read plenty that can be better. This is a great adventure that should be read by people who like fantasy, mystery, and paranormal stories, because the romance can get a little tiring for some.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The cover is beautiful, and the inside pages are good. However, the book is hard to read. The writing is terrible. The author explains everything in a way that is confusing. I was expecting to learn something and then find the end of the book. The "What" sections are really hard to understand. The main character is also very stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was pretty fun for a while, but then it went downhill and I couldn't wait to get back to it. I was going to be ok with this, but I'm disappointed. Not fun, not enjoyable, I couldn´t read a page without wondering if the whole story was a lie and when I think of the characters as just that, nothing is exciting. Even the ending made me cringe. The worst thing was the last chapter...the whole book is basically a fake ending. They should have kept it a surprise. I would not recommend this book to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poorly-written book about a woman's recovery after rape. The author seems to think that rape is something that is just something that happens to other women. She thinks that a rape victim is just going through a difficult time, that rape, in general, doesn't cause physical damage or pain. Her main point is that the victim's recovery is a "disposable womanhood." I found that pretty insulting. I found the author's attitude towards rape victims offensive. It's like she thinks rape is a thing that women can just choose to do. It doesn't hurt and it doesn't happen every day. The authors' attitude towards women is pretty insensitive and very misogynistic.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   My only negative about this book is that the title is a little misleading. As I read through this book, I kept thinking that the narrator was going to drop his voice, to a whisper, and then drop it all together.   There's not much actual plot to speak of, and the character development felt quite a bit too shallow, even for a work by an author who makes it a point to give her characters a sense of depth. The author seems to be saying that her characters are so good they are almost invisible, but I couldn't disagree. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The plot is a mess, the characters are boring, and the plot does nothing to advance the plot at all."   This is an absolutely fantastic book. If you're a fan of fantasy or science fiction (both of which are my main hobbies) this is a book you'll want to read.   -Alfred Rucker The Plot: The tale takes place in an alternate reality where a giant meteor impacts Earth and wipes out all life in the planet, except for one person and a few stray animals.  What Makes It Great:  This story is a fantastic one. The first few pages of the novel set the stage for what is going to be an amazing tale, then the rest of the book takes us through what happens to this one person when she finds her way to the "futuristic" society of Earth.  The Characters:  It took me a little while to get to know the characters, but after I did, I was hooked.  There's so much character growth here, from a woman who hates her husband's cheating to a woman that decides to live in a cave instead of getting married, to a man who has a secret affair with his daughter's friend and ends up with a wife who has no feelings for him.  The Plot:  The tale has a pretty great plot, but it didn't develop as much as I would have liked.  At the start of the story, we have a man that's trying to get his life back on track.  He tries to move on with a woman he barely knows.  When the meteor hit, it left behind a small group of survivors on the planet called "The Village."  This group of people have been through so much together.  They've been through war, famine, disease, loss of loved ones and they've worked hard to build their home.  Then, everything changed.  As the story progresses, we learn that the survivors are being hunted down by the people that came from the meteor to destroy them and replace them with their own kind.  And this brings us to the protagonist, John, and his wife, Anne.  We learn that John has never told his wife about his affair with her friend and that Anne has been trying to live her life in silence.  But after the meteor hits, things start to change for Anne and John.  John discovers his feelings for Anne, but he can't say anything about it because Anne refuses
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think it's a bad read. I mean, if you're looking for a good read on a rainy Sunday night, this may be just the book for you. The book is set in a town, where everyone in the town is in love with their cat. That's about it, nothing else. The main character, named Lulu, meets a cat lover, and the story becomes a "love" story. Unfortunately, this love story is not that well-thought out, and it's pretty much a rip off of a famous, popular book. It just wasn't done properly, and I couldn't connect with Lulu and her love for her cat. Also, the book is just so short. And the ending is so predictable. So, I can't recommend this book. The review on Goodreads:  I really liked this book, but it's kind of a weird book. If you love romance and your cat, this is a good, fun read. The only problem is that it could have been so much more than just a cat book. A little bit more love would have gone a long way. I'm not usually a fan of reading cats, but I loved Lulu's cat, I felt like I knew her, and she got all the girl-love I needed. Other Reviews of this book: The Lulu review from Library Journal:      Lulu is a beautiful story about a girl who falls in love but is also a little bit lonely as she gets older. I thought the book ended on a pretty nice note, but there were some pretty dark parts in there as well. I think the story could have ended with the cat's death, but that's just me thinking that's a more happy ending. Amazon review:  My first pet, Lulu lived about 8 years and in that time she did everything, whether it be cuddling, playing with my kids, eating food and sleeping. She was a sweet, quiet cat that enjoyed the company of humans. She never bothered me, which was a rare treat for cats, who often seem to make little things like me anxious by their incessant antics and love of attention. When she was a little older, her owner decided she wanted to have more experience with people. So she got a pet sitter, but Lulu never seemed interested in being a pet and never took well to being touched. She has not touched me in years. My

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am going to be totally honest: I didn't like this book at all. First of all, the story of a little boy who has been abandoned by his parents and left alone in the dark woods to fend for himself was not at all what I was looking for. The story is mostly about a boy with the ability to use his father's magic sword to attack the evil monsters that have been plaguing the little town of Orenburg. But the real villain in this story is the monster that the boy's father abandoned him to. The way he tortures him and how he torturously punishes him, it is hard to forgive this monster. I am surprised that the author didn't just give him a name and say, "That's a bad guy," but rather gave us a more sympathetic villain that was also a victim.  I understand that the story is about the abuse a child receives in his or her relationship with the mother. But I didn´t like that they were always on the verge of a physical fight. If they hadn't had to fight at all, I would have liked the story a lot more. The little boy being alone in a dark forest and the monster being a wolf was never a good pairing. The fact that there was an evil wolf monster who also happened to be a wolf is a really dumb idea. That's exactly why the wolf was a real and terrible villain. He wasn´t scary and he didn´s't have any special powers, just a lot of stupidity.  (review from the front)  This book is one of the first "new" books I've had to start reading since I began working on this blog. It's an excellent start to a collection of stories. Unfortunately, my first reaction to this book was that it's too short, although I read it in a couple of sittings. I found the characters of the story to be rather flat and the story itself too basic for my tastes. Still, the stories are great in their own right, and the collection of them together is a good read (the story in this book does get a little predictable). If you like stories about a little girl who fights her way through monsters in the woods (especially if the monsters are just normal forest critters), this is the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst thing about this book is that it was only about half the length of the rest of the trilogy!

Yes, as a way to get through the first half of the novel, this is a good audiobook. The other two books were not quite as good as this one. I really liked the idea of a story told through a character's eyes, although it's a little hard to listen to without a good book or a good friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted this book, but I was not interested in the idea that all of the other books I've read are all "wacko." The story is so different from the other ones that it was just not a book I could recommend. This book is about a girl, who has just broken up with her boyfriend, but is still feeling pretty hopeless. But then a new, handsome boy at her school starts to flirt with her, and a little later the new boy starts to notice her too, and she finds that there is something in common between them. I really liked the idea. But the story is just terrible. The character was so unlikable. I just couldn't get behind the "hero" in this book. I kept thinking "oh, he's kind of a douche, but then he saves her from the bullies," and then he turns into a douch. I'm not even joking, they made her feel totally inadequate and weak, even though she was the one saving everyone. I hated this book at first because it didn't feel like a story, it felt like an idea that was just there to put on paper. I mean, the guy with the "douche" in his name would have been great, but at this point he wasn't a likable character. So I ended up skipping the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only book I can think of on my "favorites" list that I can't stand is the one about David Foster Wallace. This book is a long, boring collection of his personal essays. He does this thing where he's telling a long story, but when he gets to the last section, the story is over and he has to start another one. I mean, the last sentence? And the whole book? That is boring, to put it mildly. I got it for my birthday. The reason I say I don't like it so much is because I actually like the other books he wrote about his childhood. The ones about growing up in a poor family? Those I actually liked, anyway.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book a few weeks ago in exchange for a complimentary copy of a different book I've been wanting to get for a while.   The novel is good, and although the characters are a bit too on the nose, I liked them.  As far as the storyline goes, the characters and the story are very entertaining. But the problem with this book is that it's really just the author's ideas that drive the story and not anything new.  I had been looking for a book about a "secret agent."  The agent is actually a very good and likable character, and he has some very creative ideas that are clever, but his idea of solving problems is so boring and unimaginative, that I was ready to turn the whole novel off at the first chance I had. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has some very interesting things to say about religion and philosophy but most of it just sounds like a bit of drivel about "how we think" that would never be taken seriously by a real philosophy class.    This is my first philosophy book. I am glad that I picked it up. I can't wait to read more from him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's an interesting concept, but I think it fails because it uses a formula that's too easy to use, and too difficult to change. In the beginning you think you're playing a game, but it ends up being way more mundane than it needs to be. The plot is pretty weak, and the characters are really one-dimensional.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   .   A bad book is a terrible book that should be taken away from the shelves.   What the author wrote was a "good book" in every sense of the word.  It had great plots and wonderful characters. The characters, however, are boring, as you can see in my one star rating.  This book is about a boy who, through some strange coincidence, is given the chance to be a spy.  He learns how to live a normal life as a spy, but he begins to wonder if his true love is even out there, hidden.  For those who don't mind a bit of "mood whiplash," I would give this a three or four star rating instead of a three.  I know it's a series, but I really wanted to have more of a story than a few pages of "action." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is only one fault in this book, and it is the fault of the author, not the reader. If one was to give this book a two, one might say that it could have done a little better at conveying some of the underlying philosophical concepts, which I find hard to imagine when I look at it. The author, however, does a great job of explaining these concepts.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not sure what the big deal was about the book, but I did not enjoy it at all.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A horrible book that is full of false info, as far as I'm concerned. The book states that the book was translated from Chinese to English. That is not true. All the information in the book is in Chinese. But the book does say that there are many books with some of the information, so they are not true, but just a hoax. The best way to tell if a book is really written in English is if someone says, "No, I can't read this, it's written in Chinese."  Review written by: David H. Date Added: December 27, 2012   This book tells the story of a man who went to live in the Philippines on a boat, and then met a woman who is an American of Asian descent.   The whole story is a fabrication, with the most obvious falsifications being about what the man is doing in the country (and by association, the woman). The man is never in the U.S. at all, nor is he a U. S. citizen. In fact, the first mention of the man in the text is in an article on an American website, where the man states that his name is Michael K and that he was born in Pennsylvania. A little research shows that Michael K was a pseudonym used by a Chinese-American man who lived in China and who, in turn, used the name of a Chinese American man who died in China in the mid-1930s. The fact that the author seems to think that this could possibly happen and yet be believable is not only irresponsible, but also offensive to all U. s. citizens of Asian heritage, since this story is clearly a racist fabrication.   The woman who he met is also not a real person. She is a fictional character who has no relationship with the actual American. The main character is a Chinese woman who, although she doesn't know that the man on the boat is not a U S. or even American, she is still impressed with the man's achievements because they show she has been to far away countries, and was very intelligent. This is a common Asian stereotype that is used as an example of how intelligent the Asian character is. The man's wife is an Asian woman who has apparently forgotten that her husband is actually a man. She apparently married him in order to impress Chinese men and to obtain money. The only time she is ever mentioned is when the man tells her that he is a journalist, which
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book on a train. It was a fast paced read. I could not keep up and got bored halfway through. It is not very good, and very short. This was a waste of my money and time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a few bad books from the late 80s and early 90s that I still find enjoyable. I like that these authors are writing about something they have experienced, not some sort of fictional future. I've also found that a few of these books don't necessarily reflect the way the authors have matured as individuals, which is good to see in a story that's only two to three hundred pages long. But the book was so short that I didn't find much reason to finish it. This is not a bad story per se, but not a great one either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *The story is about a little girl who is having difficulty at her new school. I did not like it at all. It starts off well, but the writer never got me interested. There were two other children who also seemed to be having difficulties and I really didn't feel like I was helping them. *I found the book very repetitive. It had to be, the book was about a young girl who had a hard time. *The main character's name was Emma, I was never sure if the name was supposed to mean something good or bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best book I've read. It just made the series complete. The first two books were great, but this book made the story even better. I'd say it's the best book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book. I am not sure what to think about the writing. I have read many books in this genre that I do not like, but this one is different. The story is very boring and it doesn't make sense how the man could die and then come back. The characters were very flat, and the writing style is also very poor. It was very difficult for me to take this book seriously.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A great book about a great person with a horrible fate. She was a loving, sweet, kind, beautiful and wise woman. A true saint.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an absolute disaster, a poor excuse to waste our time on a series that should have already been discontinued. The last book in the series has a really great beginning and a really interesting climax, but then it gets completely lost in the first 20 pages or so. The ending is terrible, and that was only because this book is supposed to be a sequel to the first. The only reason to read this book besides nostalgia is because you'll get to see what happens when a new character is introduced to the series. I wish that the author had made a point of keeping the characters a secret. This would have been a much better ending if it was not only forgotten about but also never mentioned again. 2 stars instead of 1 star because I thought I had it figured out and got it wrong, but that's not the same as a bad review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The writing style of this book is just terrible, even the best authors have writing that's just a little too long. The story was really boring but the characters were very interesting. The first half of the book is about a young woman who's just out of college with a job in a very corporate environment and her relationship with a colleague. The second half is about how she's becoming a single mom with her daughter and the problems she's going to have and how she just doesn't think she'll ever find love again and how terrible her life will be. At no point during this book were there any emotions that I was involved with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The idea of the story is interesting, but the execution is terribly done. The author tries to tell the story using a lot of dialogue but fails to make the characters or the plot very compelling.     It's a pretty cool book, but I think that the author could have done a much better job with the story if he spent a little more time developing the story before he tried to tell it through a series of chapters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very good book, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if the author had done a better job of introducing the characters and developing the plot. I'm just not as hooked on the story as I would be on a mystery book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very basic and short work; and that's fine, it's what it's supposed to be. I can appreciate that the author tries to keep the plot fresh. However, I couldn't stand the ending, which ended up being so unrealistic that I had to keep re-reading to figure out why that was supposed to happen. Posted by John O'Hara at 12:51 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and I was disappointed. It was so far from anything that I was expecting. It's a very depressing book and there's no happy ending at all, but still you have to read it to see the terrible and ridiculousness of it.  It is soooo long and there are so many bad things about it. And there are all these characters. It made me feel like I have so much more to deal with than what I was reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book a lot and I was quite excited to read it, but when I started reading it I found myself quite confused at how the characters became so evil, because I didn't really understand why they were doing things and how they could actually be evil, and their motives seemed very shallow and self-serving. I didn' t understand why anyone would do evil things to others, especially considering the fact that they didn't know them or have to worry about them, and it just didn't make sense. The only person that seemed like they could be "evil" in this book was the protagonist, but the other characters, even the ones he is fighting against, were more than "self-serving", and they seemed just as confused and had no clear reason why they wanted to do bad things. I would like to see some characterization of the evil in this world. It's almost as if the story was so obviously trying to sell a certain idea, that when you actually get to the character that is trying to create it, it doesn't quite fit, but instead of getting offended, you want to see more of that part of the story.  "A good thing about being alive is you can still see the good in people" (the first sentence). The first thing that came to my mind is, what a horrible excuse for a sentence.  is the first sentence. The first person that came into my mind was, what an horrible excuse of a sentence it is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author should really know what he is doing when he decides to write a fantasy novel in the same genre as his usual horror novels.  This book is a mess. It is a combination of several different genres, but the problem with it is that the author decides to make up a fantasy world where magic is real but people are mortal and they have to pay a huge amount of money to use it. So basically you have wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and a bunch of other stuff.  The main character, "The Lord of the Rings" fanboy, was the main character of the book and I have to say he was a bit one-dimensional.   There were things about the characters I liked, but in my opinion they did not fit the setting, and there is a huge gap between the characters and the plot, which was not the case in the book.  It is very short, but it is not long enough to have you hooked on the whole story and all its parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had the misfortune of reading this book before it was published, and it was a really bad book.   This book is a work of fiction about the history of a band called the Velvets, and the life of a former member of the band.  The story was very badly told, and I just did not enjoy reading this novel, I was never really interested in the story in the first place.  The book tells the story of two people from different generations: the storyteller is the one who has always known the truth, the story is told through a series of drawings and written down, and this is where the problem begins.  First off, we are told that this story takes place in 1960, and that these drawings are from 1960, this means that if we had just walked around at that time, we would be able to get the idea for this story.  Then we are given a long description of a long and convoluted story that includes a lot of lies, and lies, lies, lie.  Also, the author states that he is a "vendetta artist", which is the term used for someone who "draws a picture of the vengeful person".  There is also a whole scene in the book that was very unnecessary, where the story gets all convoluted because the story tells the Vendebs "what they want to hear".   There are also a lot, if not all, of people that do not die in the ending, I am not entirely sure what is the real reason for why everyone is dead, or if it really makes any difference.  So what happened is, one of the characters, Johnny, decides to live a life without the Venextts because he likes the "new" world that has emerged, so he stays with a girl named Susan and they go and live and play and everything.  Johnny is very confused about this change, but he keeps on living and having fun, this goes on for a few years, and he then decides he wants to leave Susan and go back to the old world, and go into it with a vengeance.  We are then introduced to a guy named Michael.  Michael is a fan of the group, but is also very bitter and bitter that the VE6s "fucked him over".  So this is how the book begins: Johnny Veenet and his new girlfriend Susan Veenets decide to leave their life of luxury and
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about an all around good guy who kills a lot and isn't evil or corrupt.   It's a decent read, but nothing special. I'll have to give it a second try to see if the sequel will be as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is that it feels like this author has written a couple of novels in the series, which he then takes out, then adds a few things to make them all the same, and then comes back and claims that the whole thing is the same story but better, which just makes it worse. The stories are all about being a child and being a man's man and trying to be a man, but I never bought into that. I think the author is just trying to tell a story for himself, because in his real life, which is not good, he is a narcissist and thinks he has the right to use his story to further his ego.   I've never read this book or anything by this author, so I don't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't know what "The Man Who Would Be King" is, I hope you get this book because it is not going to disappoint. I gave this book 5 stars, I will give it 4 stars now.   The writing and characters were perfect for this book. The story follows three main characters: Robert, a child, David, a student, and a king. We learn about Robert's past as an orphan and the events leading up to his decision to become king. Then we find out about David, who is just trying to survive in a world full of monsters and danger. Then Robert is king and we follow his life as he tries to do what he has to do to rule. The writing is very good, the book flows nicely and you don,t think the author is trying too hard.  I would give this book 3.5 stars, but the ending is awful. I found it very depressing and the ending left me so sad that I actually shed a tear. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really hate when this happens. A book that I've been waiting for for YEARS gets shoved down my throat. I bought it and when I got it home I realized it's like 100 pages of nothing. I'm not sure what I got myself into with this one but I have no faith in a "young adult" type book. No wonder a couple of friends are skipping it for this type of book. I will be disappointed if I don't give it a second chance. Read Full Review  5 I didn't want to like this one, and the synopsis makes it sound like it is a book for the teens only, but i bought it anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be one of the worst things that has ever happened to me.   The premise:  A young man, named Mike, lives with his father and two uncles, Mike's mother having died from cancer at a young age.  The book starts off with the main character, Mike, being the first in his family to graduate high school.  This makes him stand out in a neighborhood full of college graduates and people that grew up to be successful.  After his dad dies and his mother moves back to her hometown, Mike has to be a step-son to his step-mother.  Mike's father doesn't like this at all, telling him he's never going to be the man he was and his father wants Mike to "get a good job."   But Mike refuses.  He believes that he'll be a better man and a better parent, he's too young for that.  When Mike's step-mom moves in, Mike is left to care for his half-sister, Marla, who is on the verge of being a teenage runaway.  I did not like the main family, but I was willing to give the young boy a shot.  However, the story's most despicable aspect is the protagonist's stepmother, Mary, the mother who brought her son up.  In the story, it's revealed that Mike's grandmother and mother are in a serious relationship.  She tries to get her grandson to leave her, but Mike thinks of her as a mother figure to his brother.  Her behavior is truly disgusting.  While I did like Mike, I was never a fan of Mary.  For example, in one scene, Mary's brother, John, is in jail, and she tells her son to do something about it.  John, an ex-drug addict, is also in jail.  That's it.   Mike's brother is on death row.  And then there's the main love interest, a girl named Samantha.  As far as I'm concerned, that is about all I can say about the main characters.  Other characters are a little more interesting.  The brother and his girlfriend, John and Samantha's mom, have a lot in common.  Samantha's father is a convicted murderer, she's also a drug addict, and John is a recovering addict.  It's clear that the couple was in a relationship because John says he and Samantha are close
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and I was disappointed. I felt like I was reading a bad version of a popular and fun book. The author, John Riddell, seems to think that if he wrote a good book, it would get a good review. Unfortunately, that's simply not the case. The story is a bad read. There are no exciting plot twists or surprising revelations in this book. There is one scene I really liked, but the rest of the book was a boring, cliche adventure with no real tension. The writing was bad, and the characters seemed unappealing. There was nothing for me to like about the story. The only good part of the story was the little boy. I loved the little man so much. I hope he makes an appearance in the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      A very disappointing and badly written book.   The author begins by saying that he's a long time reader of the books in this series. This is not true. This was my first exposure to this series and I loved the original series.       The author has a tendency to write very well in the first book. Then, in the next book he has the gall to write well but forget the details. I had to put my book down and reread it for the last time, to find where he messed up in this one, not that he did much wrong. In addition to being a good first read, the story is also very good and the ending was nice. The book takes a long long time to get to the final point, but it's well worth it.   But in the end, I cannot recommend this book. The story has problems from the very beginning, with the very first sentence:   "They could barely walk, much less run. He could not bring himself to call them his companions, and they could not be called his. They were just people who didn't feel like he did about the things he'd done. 'I should have killed you,' he said."   I don't know, this is all too simplistic. The world building and the characterizations are really quite good and give this book some life. The first two books were great, and in my opinion, the characters, both the main ones and the side characters, were much more developed. However, in this book, the plot is just not enough, and it's difficult to figure out where the story went wrong, especially in the last book. Some things seemed to be left out, but the main points are all there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really thought I was going to like this book.   After I finished reading it, I'm really not sure.  There were a lot of good parts, but a lot had to do with the fact that the plot was extremely cliche:    a group of students with little to no actual skills are hired to go around the country (to a certain degree) in order to raise money for a local school and, with the help of their former teachers, they attempt to make the kids do the work they should be doing, and a teacher with a bit too much influence over the students gets himself killed.  And I'm being pretty critical here:  The plot doesn't really work, especially when you take into account the number of times the students go to the teacher's house to play.  However, the book does have a lot more things going for it than the plot.  The characters were very well-written, and the relationships between them were very interesting.  Although the characters were somewhat shallow, they were believable.  I enjoyed reading about the main character's relationship with his girlfriend.  It made her so much more believable. She was a good character.  She wasn't annoying like a lot other girls the protagonist dates.  All of her friends seemed like they had the potential to be really great people, but instead they seem to be doing things because they are pressured to.  Also, at least a few of her other friends seemed to be into drugs or alcohol, and there were several times when I couldn't help but wonder what kind of person these friends were.  Unfortunately, the writing was very inconsistent.  Sometimes there were sentences that didn't seem like they were supposed to be in the book, or sometimes there were sections where the characters said or did something but it just didn't make sense.      The book's ending didn't feel all that satisfying.  Instead of being satisfied that they got the money, I felt like they went home and the teacher was still alive and that they didn't get paid.  As much as I liked the plot, there were a few things about the book that just didn the book really well. I'd give this book a 4/5, but I think it'd be much more if it didn't have so many cliches.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is boring.   It's got a good premise but the characters in the book aren't that interesting, nor do they seem to care about their relationship with one another.   Recommendation:  Recommended to a friend to read but there are better romance books out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a piece of shit and was just a waste of time. It was supposed to be a book about the importance of being happy and in a positive frame of mind, and it just gave me the chills every time I read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book, although I have heard so many bad things about it, to be pretty fun. I got this book at a good price, but it was the type of book you might want to keep for a longer period of time. This was the first book in the D&D fantasy series, which is a very unique genre, and as such is probably not something you'd want to read if you're in a fantasy series and have never played or read the game (and certainly not if you've played or played only one or two D&d adventures). I really enjoyed it and I'll likely go back to it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narrator did a very poor job with telling the story. The words seemed to get lost as the character's voice gets lost, and the narration can be quite jarring at times. The pacing of the book is also quite terrible and very repetitive. The book is very long and the author has made a very bad book.  A great and very exciting book, in fact, a very enjoyable one.   An honest, detailed, and interesting review. It's interesting to read about how different cultures are related in the world that we live in, and how history can sometimes be a great mirror of today's society. It would be better if the narrator of the story was better, as the story could be better written. But this book is still a great read, with a very likable main character. And I would recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a great sci-fi read. The narrator did do a good job with the story, but the story as a whole was lacking in detail, which is why the narrator did an ok job. This book is a fun read, and one that I'll probably re-read, as I'm already reading the sequel. I think that I would rather read the story about a young girl's journey to find a mate, as that would be far more interesting.    4.5/5 (Excellent)  (5 out of 5)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know how I have not read this before, and I have read so many. I think the reason I haven't read it is because I don  This is an absolutely horrible book. I really wanted to like this book. It had the potential to be a great story about people who don't think people with Down syndrome are mentally ill. I've seen some of the other reviews and I don' t think there are many bad things about this book, but the way this book was written, I couldn't. Not because the characters are stupid or don't have any social skills. I actually thought some of them had a few social skills, but I don t know why.   The author does this all the time. He does a lot of things in a very generic and boring way. I can understand the idea behind it, but that's where it starts to go wrong. For example, he uses the word "dumb" a lot, when all that they really mean is "lacking social skills." They are not dumb people in the typical sense, because they do things, like, with other people. They do not just sit in a room and play video games, they are in contact with people, and some of their actions, like talking to a person with Down Syndrome, were really strange. But if you really think about it, their mental health is affected by the fact they have Down Syndrome. It might not affect everyone the same way, but their problems are the same as anyone else's. But because the author is a white man, he can't write something that would be different. The problem is that the character that is a bit of a jerk to everybody else is a hero to the character he hates most. It's like a spoiled child that just has the attention of the parents and gets the worst attention and punishments. I'm glad that there are other people who want to understand their child. But I am disgusted by what I read. It makes me really, really sick to read books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I would want this book is to help my friends and family, but then I would only get so much benefit. I would like to write a positive review about this book, but it is just too slow to be read, I can't understand a thing and it will make my brain hurt to see all the spelling errors, it is so hard to understand why you have to look for words when it comes to sentences, it just sucks up a whole page to read.   A great story for the times it was written, but the writing style is too slow for reading and it is the reason I give it 3/5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think I have ever bought a book so ill-advisedly, so poorly constructed, so pathetically uneventful, so completely boring. The only things I really liked about this book were the characters, and that the ending was quite well done.    It's just plain bad writing.   I hope someone is reading this.  It does not read well.  I bought it online. It is a horrible book. I think it is about a witch who kills herself, then kills the witch who was her master. That is not an interesting story at all.  That is probably the best part.  But the characters...  What is going on with the characters? I don' t get it. They do not add anything to the story, they are all flat and boring and I can't even remember why I picked them up in the first place.  One of them is called Sookie. I don''t even remember her name.  What about the other two characters? Well they are a couple of older characters, they seem to have some interesting things to say and they are actually pretty well written, but this book is all about the witch and her love for her, and she is so one-dimensional.  She can''t do anything about her evil doings, they just happen and she just keeps on going on about how she loves him and what a wonderful and strong woman she is, until she decides that she has had enough of him.  In her own words: I am a witch, I will not be controlled by this man. I will leave this man to his own devices if it makes me happy. It''s pretty clear she is not being controlled by him in any sense that I can understand at all...   This book was boring as all hell, and so was it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would only recommend this book for the horror genre. I've read a lot of the gory books and have loved them. In this book, however, the book became a little ridiculous at times. The story would become a little too far fetched. But it's not worth it for the gore.    Overall, I will recommend this to horror fans looking for something a little more out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of reviews of the Book of Mormon that had "good" in the title. But there are a few that are "bad" and one is just plain wrong.   The first reviewer (below) is right about the first verse: "For behold, I, God, have seen the afflictions of my people, yea, and also the trouble which is among my people; and I know that they shall cause much blood to be shed among them; and also among the Lamanites, and their brethren, and that much bloodshed shall be among the people of Nephi." This is a true prediction of what will happen. "And also among my fellow servants the Amalekites, who dwell in the mountains, in the borders of my inheritance; yea, these have labored with me in the wilderness, from the time that the children of Ammon began to take upon them the abominations of their iniquity. And their labors which they had done unto me in that wilderness, that they did not destroy me, but they did destroy their seed." I find this prophecy concerning the LAMANITES to be one of the best that the Book is able to give.  But let me get the problem. The Book of Abraham actually gives the second prophecy and this one is so bad, that even the faithful can see that it is not in keeping with the Bible.  In this prophecy: "And they shall dwell in a land which shall be called the land of their inheritance, which is the land Bountiful, because of their exceeding faith." In the Book Of Mormon there is no mention of Bountifully nor any place called Bounteous. Instead, the land is called the promised land. Why then would Abraham, who lived in a more recent era, describe a land that had not been promised? Why would he call it the land that would become the promised Land? The fact is that the land described by Abraham is no longer the land to which he refers and so this "land of their Inheritance" that they will dwell in no longer is mentioned in the Book.  Why does God promise this land to them? The reason is that he is using the same names that were used to name other places in the land. Here are the original names of the lands which were known by the LAMAITES (the Amalickiahites) and the LEMONITES: Bountily ( B
Write a negative review about a bad book:     As for the book itself, the story is interesting and interesting in a bad way. It is told from a guy's point of view, which makes it feel more like a movie that is meant to be enjoyed by the author's family rather than the reader, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt and say the book is entertaining for the sake of entertaining.   The idea of a guy who can fly through the air is not new. It just makes me want to read more. It has been done before. However, there are only three chapters in the first part of the book and one in the second that were well-written. That might make me a bit wary about giving it the rating I do, but the parts that were not good were actually enjoyable. I think that the author tried to make the story more of a mystery, but only managed to pull it off for me, so I'm not sure if I am giving the book a good rating, just for the fact that it's the kind of book that I wanted to know more about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really thought this was going to be an epic saga of the end of the world and all sorts of strange creatures with tentacles, but I was really disappointed, I think. The author was a good story teller, but the actual story was a little too flat. I think he should be writing a science fiction novel, not just a horror novel. I would give it a three if I could!

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last 5 books I have read in this series, I have had to take breaks from the series because my brain was trying to process everything, and sometimes couldn't handle all of the information. I've read them all several times before and enjoyed them, but I found this book difficult to follow and take in at once. The pacing of the story is uneven and the plot is quite confusing. I was trying hard to make sense of what was going on and didn't know what was happening, or why it was happening. I know they are telling me this story, but it made it hard for me to care about the story. This is the weakest book in the series. 4.5/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book very much.   A lot of what happened wasn't very believable to me and it really made me feel like I'd just been taken in.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only flaw in this book is the first half, the third and last third are completely different books (at least for the first twenty pages).  The last book is a real work of art, I recommend it to any fan of books about history.  A great read about the first black president.    This book will not leave you with the slightest impression that the book was good, but a true achievement.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a complete disaster.   This book was a complete failure from the beginning.  It has a lot of good ideas but very little development.  This is my second review of this book and I have to say that I am very disappointed.  The characters have no depth.  There is very little story.  They are all just stand-ins for the other two main characters.  Most of the character development is in the back half of the book.  My biggest complaint is that it was almost impossible to keep up with.  I have read plenty of paranormal books that have been interesting and well thought out.  However, this book just is not.  If you like ghosts and other weird paranormal things, you may love this.  Otherwise, I can't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You know the scene: A girl is walking down a long, straight street and spots a beautiful young man on the other side of the road. The girl walks up to him, puts her arm around his shoulder, and they both walk a few more steps before the young man puts his hand on the girl's arm and they start walking back together.  The girl can't help but want to look, but just can't bring herself to look. As they walk along, they realize that they're both going to love each other for ever after, and so they kiss. After a few minutes of walking back and forth, they reach a large park. They both find the same bench where they'd first met. The young man, a senior at their high school, walks up next to her, says hello, and leans over and whispers in her ear "I've been thinking of you." She blushes, but tells him she's a little busy today, but he can ask her out if he wants. They start to make out.  And then the story picks up.  They've made out, but she wants to kiss him and pull away, but before she can pull away he pulls back.  He kisses her back. And then she starts kissing him back. This book is a very good book for people who like romance and romance books, but don't like anything particularly romantic about them.  This isn't your usual romantic book, but if you're a romance reader looking for something different, you might like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book. I did not know much about the Bible before I picked this book up and I was very surprised at some of the interesting quotes. The book is not very hard to read and does not really have much to teach.   The book has a lot of great quotes, but it can be a bit over-the-top. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bit boring. It's a classic from a great writer, but not much else. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "   This book is a disaster.   It's a collection of short stories with some clever tricks.  There are no stories that are really very good and most of the ones that are good are also kind of bad.  It is like a book that's been cut into half by the editor or something.  The stories don't make sense and there's no logic to the characters.  They're like walking around on a field with nothing but rocks in your pocket.  I've seen worse and there are better stories in there.  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete flop for me. I enjoyed it when I read it the first time. After finishing it the second time, I had to put it down. The writing was not up to the standards of most of the other books in this series. It had the same problems that I have read before with a young boy. The story is about a little boy who thinks he is a girl. The book was very confusing and the last 30% had some really bad grammar that ruined the book for me for being an easy read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a fan of science fiction I was excited to receive this book. It was a very fast read. I like to read non-fiction and this book was a good introduction to the concepts of evolution. However, I did not get the impression that the author really wanted to explain evolution. I feel that the book's main purpose was to present a religious argument as fact. It would be better to have the author have explained why the argument he presented is so faulty. I found myself thinking that maybe I am not the only one who did not understand the point of this book, and the author will need to rethink his approach to writing science fiction for young people.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just found the book after searching and can say that I am pleased with the book. There were many reasons I bought this book, but one of the reasons was to learn more about the history of the United States and how it evolved in the last 200 years.  This book definitely helps me understand the past better and the events we as Americans remember.   Also, there are some quotes that are very interesting, which help to explain the things I wanted to learn from the book, although this book was not that good as many others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A boring book with a story that goes nowhere"  I'm not sure what it is about this book, but it's so bad it's good, at least in the story department. I liked the first part of this book. It was interesting to see how the people in the school reacted to the strange events happening around them. There were some interesting characters in the first section of this story, including a "punchy" student named Mary who was the only one who was willing to do something about the paranormal in the class. I didn't like Mary very much; her behavior at times was over the top and she was just acting out of boredom. I felt like this was the main reason why the story wasn't very compelling. There was a very annoying scene in which Mary came to school late one morning, and because she did she had to deal with a group of kids that tried to steal her car. The whole situation was just stupid and it just made me laugh. But, what made the story even worse was when a couple of the other kids in the student body got ahold of Mary's car keys, and proceeded to drive it around and destroy it. It's so sad that the story got to a part that made it seem like the characters were actually living this situation. As a result, I felt the story was only decent. As soon as it got to the part with the paranormal, it lost me completely. The next day, the class went to a field trip that had a very special guest. The story took a turn that I thought was really interesting, and I thought would be a good read to see if anyone in the group could actually pull it off. Unfortunately, it all went wrong. This time around, the guest was a witch who came to the school to bring back the evil spirit from the grave to hell. However, once again, the story failed in making me care about any of the characters in it. I have a feeling this story was a way for the author to have a laugh, and it's pretty poor. I thought the author was making fun of this particular book, as she has written other books where a student is tricked into killing a classmate and then they both end up getting killed by the same ghost. I think I would rather read a book called The Ghost Of A Ghost Or Something Or Other.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in 3 sittings. It was a very interesting read. The book is good at a few points but it falls flat at others. It did a good job at showing what the brain does when people are told to do something. At points I was thinking the author was trying to teach us about what is happening in the brain when we do or say something and I think that is a good thing. At other times, it just made me think about how much work we have to do to get better.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    As with a lot of people, I have a love-hate relationship with the movie, but the book was terrible. This isn't the case with the book. It's a very, very good book. The book is a great source of information about the war, how things were going, and why the war ended. What I don't like is that the author had his own prejudices and that the writer of the book had a very biased view, but that's not to say the book doesn't have some good information. As with most books, you can get a very good understanding by reading the author's biased version, but if you want a completely objective view, this is a good book to look into.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book suffers from many issues. This book is a compilation of the author's experiences in the field of education, primarily with her own students. There is not one word written about teaching, but rather about her own experiences of teaching and about other educators' experiences. I found it frustrating to have to pick out any of the details that she felt supported her assertions, and as such, most of the book's pages are devoted to details not supported by the book. The book should have focused more on her own teaching. The rest of the authors she interviewed are very good, but the book just gives a good summary of the information, instead of a strong argument for one particular view. I did not understand a thing about much of the content of the chapter on teaching. A good argument needs a good foundation, and the foundation the book gives is flawed and misleading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot wasn't what I wanted and it ended in a way that was more like a movie than a novel. I had a lot of fun with it, but if I ever have to buy a movie or novel again I am not going to buy this one. Rating: 1 out of 5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In general, this is a boring book. It is about the author's experience with his ex-wife and a guy who, though he is a decent guy, he also had a bit of a nasty habit with his wife and with his kids. That's about it. It does have a couple of good chapters but they are short. It's really only for the couple. It doesn't make the divorce any easier.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book so much that I gave it 5 stars. But it's a terrible book.   The main character, a very talented musician, is murdered by a mysterious drug addict. The police suspect a local drug lord of the crime.  He is then arrested and imprisoned, only to be rescued by his good friend (a drug addict) while under the influence of a powerful drug.  And it turns out, the drug is a poison designed to turn people into musicians and drug dealers and a bunch of other things.  "I don't know who's going to save me, me, or the world." (page 4)  The only good thing about the book is how the main character's friend's tragic death at the end of the book makes him a better person. But the rest of the story is a miserable mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no such thing as a bad story.  I would give this 5 stars if it had a better ending.   4 of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The plot is not engaging enough.   I would have liked to have seen a more in depth look at the relationship between the two characters, which would have made the book a lot more interesting.  I do not believe that the plot is being resolved because of the love triangle, because there is still no resolution on this point at all, so why is the story so long and how does the book still not have a happy ending?   Another thing that I disliked was that the writer makes it seem as if she wants to make a romantic comedy with her characters.  She wants you to buy the book because she thinks it is romantic, but in the end it is nothing more than an empty joke, and what the author could have done better is show the actual relationship between her characters in her novels, which in some cases is far from perfect.  One last thing that was annoying about the book is that the book started so promising and full of excitement and adventure, but when it reached the ending, it was so lame and clichéd that I just wanted to skip the book.   I would not recommend this book at all to anyone, because it was very unoriginal and the writer was trying to make her books into something romantic, only for it to turn out something quite boring and unoriginal.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad part about this book is that I was looking forward to reading about the journey to come but instead I got a very predictable, predictable story. My guess is that she is an editor but her job description is that of a "creative director." There was no story to me, nothing interesting, no change of pace or direction or direction in her character.   This is what I was afraid I was going to get from a series of books. I don't know who else would think this book was a good idea.  This review has nothing to do with the plot and everything to do about the characters.  I don' t know what to say about the book other than it is a bad read, the characters were really annoying. I guess this is a good book to be read as an "alternative" to the Harry Potter series, but if you don't like the Harry potter books you'll really hate this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a huge fan of the original series (I'll re-read the first book every year until the sequel comes out) and I have to say that there is a definite change of pace in the sequel, even if it isn't necessarily a good thing. The story is pretty much the same, and I was hoping that the story would have picked up, since the plot and characters did build a bit with the first one. The fact that the "plot" of the second book is "spreading the word about the new war" is just disappointing. For all the hype that's been build about it, the war itself is a farce. If you like your action packed, epic fantasy, you may enjoy the book (it's not a bad novel by any means), but the fact that so much time is spent talking about the war really isn't necessary. If nothing else, you can still catch up on the story before the sequel because it's still fairly easy to read. However, I'm hoping that it will be better after the sequel. I can't say I've liked it as much as the original book, but it's not terrible, and for $3.99 it's worth checking out.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " I got the book, but never finished it. I started reading the first few pages and it got me hooked, but I just gave up and put it down to go do something else and now I'm back and reading again.  .. "    I really love the book! I have already gone through most of the book in my sleep. Thank you so much for writing this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this was a very interesting book to read. It's interesting that a lot of the world's religions seem to have this concept of a "sacred cow".   It's like they have a special place where their sacred cow can be.   You can feel this in the book, and there are many times when the authors have the protagonist question what's really going on.  The idea of sacred cow is a very good idea, I just felt the author was going a little overboard with it in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favorite of the series, The Book of the New Sun, gets an honorable mention for being the only book not to have any major flaws (save for one very minor one). The plot itself is good and the main character, Lord Jame, is pretty much an idiot, so that's good.   The worldbuilding is the weakest part of the book and doesn't have much to do with the plot, but the last few pages are worth the price of admission. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title says it all:  My two cents about this book is that it has some great stuff, but it's overrated. I've read the whole series, and the majority of the books (including the newest release, A Matter of Gravity) are excellent, though I will not buy them again. This book has a pretty good plot, but the characters just aren't compelling enough to make it compelling. They're too nice and they're not believable enough. I think they're mostly a cast of characters that are pretty much the exact same as in the series:  These two are not.  You would think that, after spending nearly two decades as a cop, he would have some sort of appreciation for the law (even if you do think he might be a bit overprotective of the girl he's with in this book), but he actually says things like "she is a thief, and that is a crime" (as if he was talking about the girl who's stealing from him in the first book) and has a very poor understanding of the law.  This is not good.  The rest of the characters are pretty bad, too:  There's a new character, a detective named Mr. Smith, who's supposed to be a tough detective.  He's apparently a former friend of the main character's (played by John Cusack), and is trying to be helpful, but has a way of getting into trouble.  His relationship with the main characters seems to be more like the friend-rival thing, and it gets annoying after awhile.  She has a tendency to talk over him and talk down to the characters, and when she doesn't like something she'll just start to get annoyed at the characters and get really snippy.  But really, all of these people are the same.  There are a couple of great scenes, but they're overshadowed by the main thing the book does (which is to make these characters look like they're constantly complaining about the problems of their lives).  I think, in general, that the series is very good, but this book seems like the only thing that really makes it great. I'm just not a big fan of this series.  Overall:  If you're looking for a great detective series, look elsewhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only negative about this book was that it is not a stand-alone book.   A little bit about the book: The main character, a female scientist, is trying to cure cancer in a few weeks but she has her heart set on a girl who was once a friend of her own who she's been estranged from for years.  There's a lot of plot-related information I won't bother to re-write here. Basically she gets a new experiment going that uses a radioactive substance that has the opposite effect to the one she wants to cure.  So it turns out to be radioactive gamma rays. I thought this was an excellent read and will definitely be looking for the sequel in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't see how a book like this can be considered an "adult" book, and that it can be described as "adult fiction." I was expecting a good adventure story. I have never seen a Disney movie where the main character had a girlfriend before meeting her.   And it doesn't help that the movie is rated "R" by the MPAA and the picture of Snow White in her dress has a pink heart in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story follows a young woman from a poor background in a slum with a dark past who has become wealthy through her work. She has a new job but has to spend a lot of time looking after her new baby. It's a long story about being poor, working and motherhood but the author didn't really make any effort to make it a story about motherhood. It just was a long list of women to write about and there weren't any characters that really had much to do with the motherhood or the story. The ending was predictable and left me feeling empty. There was a few things about the story I thought were very good and I liked the way it ended which was a nice change of pace, but I was disappointed by the ending of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will never buy another book from this author and recommend his books to others. I hate the first book of this series - it was so boring. I can't stand the second book, I am just going to skip it to avoid another disappointment. A poor story, poorly written, poorly narrated.     Don't waste your time on this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son had read this book in 1st grade. He was only 8 at the time and I think he found the stories kind of scary, with lots of "wizard" names and spells. I've read some of the stories again in light of some of what is coming out of this book. The stories seem kind of silly. Some of the characters are really irritating. But that's really not the issue. The problem is that the story line is boring and not that original. If the book were more original, I think the stories could be fun and engaging. However, the boring nature of the story and the fact that this book is not original means that it did not meet my expectations for the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book as a part of a package that was supposed to be a collection of books. I was really disappointed to read about how these books were created and how hard it was to get these books into print. A little research in the library shows the following: Most American authors like this one have been dead for years.   This is why these books are really hard to sell to librarians and libraries.  I guess you could get them in the mail or use this website but it's just going to be expensive and a lot of trouble.  One of the books I read is called "A Tale Of Two Girls," which I am not impressed with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was very bad, the protagonist seemed to enjoy the game more than any other characters, and the only character that seemed to care about the outcome was the one that actually won the game. I wouldn't say it was a bad novel at all, but it was kind of a let down.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    1/10   The characters are shallow and undeveloped. They have a lot of potential and development, but it's really hard to tell what they're going through. The book is filled with bad clichés and clichés are always stupid.   2/10 - Bad writing, poor characterization. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing was fine. I can see how this story has taken the popular imagination, but for me it's a boring story about a boring character.   As for the characters, they are all so similar I can barely distinguish any of them (except the woman with the long hair).   The one thing I really like about this story is that it's so short, and so well written.  The only thing that is not so great about this book is that there is a little bit of a cliffhanger.  However, the best thing about this short story is the fact that it ends with a cliffhangar (which I'm not a fan of, personally).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure how people know about this book. It's only available in hardcover and I bought the paperback hoping for the same good story. I was a little disappointed to find out it was just a very poorly written story. It starts out well enough. I like when a book takes an interesting premise and spins it into something interesting with interesting characters, but then it just goes off the rails. The author tries to make the story about family, and there's some nice touches that work but the story just doesn't have any of that. There's a really annoying scene where the sister is telling her story to a friend but then they start talking about how her father was "just a little man with a big ego". I found that a little too cliche. It felt so cheap to me. I guess I'm used to seeing it as a cliché or even bad writing but I think this was a bit too blatant. There are a lot of other elements that are sort of cliche but they are there for a reason: to make this book interesting and help it stand on its own. But they just come off as cliche as well. It didn't help that it was hard to tell if there was an author's note at the end of the book. I'm sure that was there but it still felt like the author knew exactly what they were doing but it didn't feel like enough explanation for what's going on. I just felt like I had to read this book for a story, not to learn something new or learn something from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I wanted to like this book more, but it was just ok.   The main story takes place in a world called "Kurvang." (I don't really know what a Kurvang is, but if you do then you probably know where this is going.) Kurvangs are intelligent, highly-evolved beings who are completely capable of using technology. They can build machines, but they can also understand and communicate with each other as well. Kurvangu's society is ruled by a mysterious leader named "The Grand Master." I don't think that Kurvanga is evil or anything like that. They just have a more advanced way of thinking, and have their own morals. It's a more interesting world than the Earth because we see things that would have never been allowed on our planet, so it's interesting to see it's rules. Kurvana is ruled through the Kurvaga council (who have a leader named the Kurvaq) and it's the Council that issues the Kurvana rules. There's not a whole lot of information in this book, but most of what is there is interesting. The main thing that really bugs me about this book was the "I'm sorry" thing. Most of the time it just makes me feel like a baby.  It's easy to see why this book is called "A book of the Dead."  The story is told through two main characters. The first character is the Kurvoraga, who are a super advanced race of beings. There is a bunch of stuff about their culture, and the main thing I'm curious about is the "gifts" they get. The Kurvorakas are really advanced. The way they build their machines is amazing. They know how to make things even better, even if they have to build them from scratch. The last chapter of this book really got me, because it has all of these characters talking about some pretty cool and interesting stuff. The other character is an Earth boy named "Derek." I'm a big fan of Derek's story, and he definitely gets the most development in this. Derek does some pretty stupid things, but I love him. I feel like we should know a lot more about Earth's culture in the future, especially with all the technology that Kurvana's got. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A couple of times I read and got a real nasty feeling about the plot. I mean I thought the book was a bit silly but it just didn't hit the mark for me.   This is not my type of book. It's not a book for young people. It may have been enjoyable for those who enjoyed a silly story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time. I could spend my time getting a better understanding of the topic, but it's clear that the authors have no interest in learning about the subject at all. The main purpose of this book is to give the reader a "feel" for the various types of "shark bites" and the related deaths.  The problem is that none of these "sharks bites" or deaths are explained in depth. I guess they just wanted to say, "This is why we're still here."  This is more an argument against the government and a warning about being vigilant about the growing trend towards militarism and fascism that we are seeing in the West.   If you are interested in getting the "big picture" you will have to do more research to find out where I stand on the various issues I've read about.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is just terrible, I mean, if it were a movie, I would not bother reading it, but it's not a movie.   I just wish I could give it zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hesitant to purchase this book, as I'm not a fan of paranormal stories but I decided to give it a try, it was a fun read. The paranormal aspect of this story was interesting and entertaining. However, the book, in all aspects, seemed a little over engineered, the main characters seemed to be forced into situations which seemed contrived and unnatural. It took more than the average paranormal detective to find this case, the rest of the books plot seemed to just lead up to that one point. Overall, it's a fun book, but I think I'd just enjoy it more if it didn't seem so forced.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some really bad storytelling that has no place in a science fiction story. I felt like the author did an excellent job of using the tropes of the science fiction genre to get a good idea of a world that was already there in the book.   When I read the book I felt it was a good enough world.  I thought that it was just a little too far off from the actual universe they created. I'm not really a big fan of science fiction with robots or magic or aliens. However, for what it was and for what they wanted to accomplish they were able to pull it off.  There is not a lot of science going on in this book, however it does have a good dose of social commentary that's interesting to read.  In conclusion,   I give it four stars out of five. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I got this book I was intrigued, but I found that the prose was so boring. I think I was expecting more of a story than the book did. I just didn't feel like the story was that important to the story being told.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a little hard to follow, and the prose is a bit repetitive.   But it is one of those books which makes you want to read it over again.  It has a great theme, and I would recommend it as a good read to people who are looking for something different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad is:  (This review is mostly about the poor writing. This book is poorly written and full of spelling errors. The characters and settings are extremely poor, and this story suffers for it. Not only did the author try to make a fast buck, he tried to make his story more exciting than it was. The character motivations are weak. The plot is terribly contrived. The ending is disappointing.) The good is: (The good is this: the author is very creative. This story is well-written and highly original.) The world building is very good and the characters are interesting. The story is fast paced and easy to read. The book is very long, but I find it is worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The most boring book in the world"  "You can't make good reading decisions if you're already bored"  The author has a habit of telling a story, while only half-hearing it:  "[In an early scene] a woman is driving through a busy street in a big sedan with several children. The woman stops in front of an empty building. A big bell rings inside and she asks the woman in the front seat if she wants to go inside. The two get out of the sedan, and the woman asks what they need. The child inside shouts at the woman that she's "fetching the mail!" Then, in another part of the book, a man with a bad case of writer's block is waiting in an elevator when a woman in a long, dark skirt comes in and asks if he wants a ride. He says yes, and she says she'll be right back."  I also get a bit confused when the author is not clearly explaining how he plans to bring about the apocalypse.   The world is the same, the people are the same -- the only difference is that the people in this world are really, really screwed over.  One thing the author does well is describe how the human brain works -- even as he's describing what is happening to the human body, he's making sure to make sure that it is really, truly messed up -- so that even when the story's setting is described (the post-apocalyptic city of New York, with its post-holocaust remnants) he still is describing what the human mind can come up with, even though he's using the same setting (the world of science fiction) that he used in The Handmaid's Tale.  The Handmaiden is a brilliant satire on gender politics in the U.S.  I got hooked on it by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really, really disappointed in this book, in a bad way. I know this is a sequel, and so I was hoping that the author would do something different with this story. I wanted her to try something more daring and less predictable. But instead, I felt like she was following the very traditional plot lines that she had used before in her other books. We're just not introduced to much new information about the characters (except for that one new character), there's a lot of repetition (which is inevitable with the usual sequel), and all of the bad guys are played by the same actor who played them in the first book. The ending was so disappointing that it almost made me want to skip the book, and I don't recommend this book to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've already read this book several times, but now I feel like I have to give it 5 stars. It is so true to its word, but also realistic. I'm a parent of two kids in kindergarten, and my son doesn't even have a clue about dinosaurs. Now that he is a toddler, he can make up his own dinosaurs from clay and paint. It makes me proud to be a mother! The book is short, but it's a good read. I would highly recommend this book to people interested in science, as well as people who want to teach their children the "hard facts".
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I felt the only saving grace in this book was that the author made a valiant effort at making me think about what my life is like as a woman, what I have been given in the past and what my future holds. But I still didn't like the way she presented it. It's a really unempathetic book. It just feels wrong that a girl could grow up in a society where she has not only been denied opportunity, but also has not yet experienced love. The book is written like someone is telling her she can't be anything but the girl that her father has been raising. She is also told she is not cut out for her future, that her mind is bad and that she has poor self-esteem. The author also says a lot of things that make me feel uncomfortable or ashamed about my own life, which is a strange thing to read when you're a middle aged white woman who has grown up in an idealized and privileged society. I also have some problems with how the author treats her own children. The first one has the same issues I have with my own kids, but is presented much better in the book. This is my first book by Kelli Jo Mclaughlin and I'm not sure how I'll feel about it going forward.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is sloppy, the story is confusing, the characters are unlikable and unoriginal, the writing is atrocious, the plot is poorly developed and contrived.    If there is something I want from a story, it's well thought out plots.  So many plot holes:  This book had an entire section on a girl who used to date her ex, and then they fell out of touch (so to speak). I'm sure it is a great plot, but it makes absolutely no sense. This is why people like plot holes, they allow the reader to enjoy the story while simultaneously learning about a character and how they interact. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very very disappointed with the plot and the characters and the author's blatant use of the F/M label to describe trans characters as villains.   This is not a novel in which the trans character, M.M., finds love and friendship with a cis male character.  She becomes attracted to M.A. who is clearly attracted to her but is not interested in a relationship.  The problem is that she is a transsexual and she is also M.O., which is not her choice to make at all.  This book would not work if it were not so clearly about the trans experience in general.  However, it has so many flaws that it is hard to recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book - but I feel I was cheated by some of the things in it. The story is good and it moves along, but the characters are so generic I felt as if the author didn't really care about her main characters. I feel the plot could've gone a lot of different ways. There's so much potential with these stories, but so much wasted potential.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The thing is the "giant" has the potential to be an epic. However, as a result of the book not developing in an interesting way, the story does not deliver its full potential. The story is boring. Not because of the plot, but because the characters are so bland and the plot does not add anything.   I'm sorry, but it really feels like this book is a giant that is being forced to put on a show.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me about 4 or 5 days to get through this book. I am a huge fan of Michael Crichton's movies and I love Jurassic Park. However, this book seemed really dull and very dry. I loved the plot and the plot was interesting and well thought out but the writing felt very cliche. The main character was like a little kid.   I thought the character was very shallow and not very original. He seems to be more of a side character to the other characters.  The author wrote about her past but the plot felt very weak.  After reading this book, I am going to stick to the books of Michael and not the movies.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author and her publisher have put a lot of work into this book. I am very glad that I decided to read the book after all that hard work. I would not recommend this book to anyone.    Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Misleading and false I did not buy this book until almost a year after I first received a Kindle in February of 2012. The first couple of chapters seemed intriguing. But, I soon realized that the author was not a medical doctor. Her reasoning for not using the correct term ("polycystic ovarian syndrome" and "cystic ovary" were used in the title of the book) was a lie. As the title states, polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (POCOS) is caused by ovaries that are over-producing follicles and causing cysts on the ovaries and uterus. I had to stop the book several times to avoid using words like "over-producing" and more specifically "overpumped." This caused me to question the validity of what the author claims. POCOS is actually very rare (only 5-6 cases out of 20 million in women), and its symptoms include irregular periods, abdominal pain, bloating, bloaty liver, acne and weight gain. It's not a "cyst" that needs to be pumped, and there is no reason to use a term like "polycyst," which is very common in normal ovaries. I don't know how this woman was able to publish a book and still be a medical student in 2012. It seems that this book is only used to get medical students to "discover" the symptoms of this condition so they can get a license so they're able to practice medicine. I was very disappointed in this book and would never recommend it to anyone, including my own mother.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are shallow.     The plot is predictable and pointless.  In fact, it's more like a bad sequel to an earlier book.  If you don't know anything about the original series, I would start from the first book, and then read the books from the beginning, as well as the series.  The stories in the series are completely unrelated.  This series could have been so much more, if the authors actually put effort into writing an interesting story, instead of having their characters and plot line constantly conflict with one another.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only book I have read this year. The ending was not satisfying. This is my first book in my library and I am reading it on an ipad for a while now and have really enjoyed it so far. This book was really interesting and a little slow at times, but it did end on a positive note. The only reason it was so slow was because it was hard to read and not read a whole page at a time. It's not a bad read, but a little boring for me and my ipad. I liked the cover though! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so surprised by how many reviews this book received that I didn't expect it to sell that much.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was in high school. I am sorry that I wasted so much time on it. It was boring and not interesting at all. The writing is horrible and it is very very difficult to read. I read it in two days because I was tired of the book and the writer's style is so very dull.   I have to admit that my high school is the same age as this book and I read books for enjoyment and enjoyment. Not for research and not for pleasure. For me, this book didn't satisfy my needs.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really get a sense of the setting as I was expecting a lot of action and action-adventure/military stories that I was not expecting at all (for the second book, it's almost as if he's taking the easy way out). The action scenes were okay, but I didn 't really get the atmosphere that I think a good military thriller should have, and the character development for most of them wasn't that good. For example, the big bad of the book is just someone who's basically the "bad guy" in a lot more than one way, and a lot like the "good guy" (and a lot less of a character and really just a plot device) in a ton more than just one way. Also the big villain is kind of stupid and not as deep as you'd expect. I didn' t really get why there was a big battle in the book (except that there is), it was just kind of a setup for the end of the story. In addition to that, there wasn't really enough of the characters who are "realistic" enough to have their own POV, and that kind of hurt the atmosphere in the novel. And then for the characters that are supposed to be "real," most of the time they' ve just sort of walking through the book in a dumb way, which didn't seem like they were really paying any attention to the characters around them and the "real" world. Finally, the ending sucked, but you just have to trust that Robert Jordan when he says he plans to write another book soon!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was really enjoyable. I found it very funny and easy to read.   A lot of the humor was derived from the story itself, which I enjoyed very much. However, there were a couple of scenes that were very repetitive and I found myself yawning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read a few different books on the subject, but this one was terrible. It was too long, too dull, and poorly researched. A couple of things that bother me about it were: 1) The book made no attempt to explain what the "dark side" of the Illuminati is. What does it mean? What does the Illuminati actually do? What exactly is the power of the Freemasons? What is the Masonic system? It just leaves this mystery open-ended. If you're going to describe a group that uses the occult to rule people, don't give it a name, a name it can live up to. It's kind of like saying, "Well, what is Satanism?" Well, that's a better question. And then saying, the answer to that question would have to include an explanation of the origins of the Satanism cult that the Illuminati's leader, Adam Weishaupt, founded. 2) And lastly, the book makes no attempt at a comprehensive analysis of the various Illuminati movements. It does, however, give a list of the main Illuminati movements, but not the actual members, and no mention of the many sub-groups that make up the Illuminati, including the Order of the Palladium, which, according to the book, is the most powerful Illuminati. 3) And finally, the authors do a terrible job of researching, especially the "History" section. The authors give a short synopsis of the history of the Order, but it doesn't give us any details of what the Illuminati has been up to in the last 500 years. 4) The history section doesn't actually give the authors a whole lot of information, except for an article by an anti-Masonic author, and an article about the Illuminati in a French magazine. There are several other historical documents that are included in the book that have been debunked, as well as some conspiracy theories about the origins and goals of the book. 5) And most importantly, the fact that this book is called "The Illuminati" is a big mistake on the authors part. Even if you aren't a Mason, it's very important to know the meaning of the word, because the Illuminati are, to all intents and purposes, the same group as the Freemason's, and if you want to understand the true power behind all Masonry, and the true aims and goals behind it, you need to know about the true origins of Masonic ritual, as told in the Illuminati
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book a shot just because I was having trouble getting into some books. I'm glad I gave it a shot! It's a good read. The narration is good. I really don't have anything negative to say about the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited when I saw the cover art for this book, it was super colorful and looked like it was written by a kid. I was extremely disappointed.   My little cousin loves the book and wanted me to read it for him, but after reading the book he said:  " I'm not sure if that was what I was hoping for, but it wasn't.  "   The character's names and dialogue are so confusing and I felt like I was reading an episode of the show.  I'm sure that I am not the only one who feels this way about this book but there was nothing in this book to make me feel excited or make me want to read more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping for a good read and to find something interesting to read. I did not get what I was looking for. It is a poor example of an old school fantasy novel. There are a few good ideas but nothing that sticks with you. My only real enjoyment was in the little back story about some old school magic that is a staple of most old school books. If you are looking for a quick read you could get a lot more from other books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The books were bad.   I read the first few chapters in one day.  I got very confused by the author's point of view and could not make head or tail of the novel.  The characters were a train wreck and the writing was awful.  They used the word "mature" as a reason not to read.  A woman should be able to have sex without getting pregnant and a man without getting raped. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had to take an hour to actually read this book to be sure it was worth the read, since I thought the reviews I'd read suggested it would be about something else.   What I got instead was more of the same as all the other books by the same author, except with a different spin.  One can see where she got her ideas from, but to say she was right about them was too much to swallow.  She says the United States has created an environment in which children can grow up with the attitude that you can do anything you want to do.  To me that's a very dangerous attitude, especially as I've gotten older.  And while the book is a little funny in places, it's really just a lot of cliches.  I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " The only bad thing about this book is that, like so many bad books, it ends up leaving the reader with a huge grin on his or her face.   For starters, we are given only two pages of information on what happens when the two characters become friends.  There are a lot of details, such as that the other characters seem to have had the same problems, but only one character mentions it.  But if the author's purpose is to tell a simple and relatable story, then he or she didn't really go about it very well.  This book's main problem is a lack of suspense and characters.  The author introduces the readers to a new person, while keeping the readers from being introduced to them as well. "  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What happened was I was excited about this book, the concept sounded interesting. I loved that it was about time travel, I loved the idea that in my mind it sounded like one of those science fiction stories from the early days of SF (i.e. in the 1960's, the idea of time travel seemed crazy) but when I got it, it didn't quite click. The story was fine in the beginning but then I found myself not liking the writing style, which was more than a little cliched. Then I saw that the only two people that would see what I was describing in the books were either the writer or her husband. I was still a bit underwhelmed but then it dawned on me that I was expecting this book to be a good read but it was nothing more than just a little annoying. A bit of a let down. I would give it a two stars but it's so far removed from my original expectations that I'm afraid I may never return to it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "    I read this book with great anticipation and excitement. After the first few chapters, I had a bad feeling about it.   The main characters seemed like they were just thrown in as filler to pad the novel out and make it more interesting.  They were introduced as if they were from a different book.  I have no idea how they could have possibly known what they were supposed to do, given they have never worked in the department before.  When a character has to go out and hire a new employee, they do it with an attitude of "I don't give a **** about the rules, we're doing it our way!   The characters also are just flat out rude to each other.  The plot and characters are all too one-dimensional, and the ending left me cold.  My recommendation:  I got bored and put this book down and haven't looked back."   (1/10)

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't get to finish this book (I can't get over how long it took to read it) I wanted to like it but couldn't really.   - the characters are all kind of dumb-   I hate when a protagonist starts out dumb and grows on you. I want to like them but it's very hard to find any flaws in them because they're stupid to begin with. In fact, I could relate more to the characters from the books I read before reading this one (I think I read a lot of these before reading the new ones.) They are all basically good at a given thing they do. They don't have the greatest relationships with anyone but they're usually just "honest" with each other. So why does that cause their stupid decisions and actions? What makes them good at what they do? That's a good question.   It might have something to do with not having a job or having a shitty one (like the waitress that goes back and forth between being a waitress and a prostitute. She gets to the point of using her job to feed her addiction. She is the same as all the other characters.) and never really having a good relationship with another person in their lives.     The plot is stupid, stupid, and more stupid.  . She basically has a plan for saving her life but it doesn't work out because the people she trusts to help her die aren't going to help because they don't know how. She has the plan but it gets destroyed because she doesn't know who to trust? The people who have a plan to save their lives aren't even good at saving their lives?   What is the point? This is the stupidest plot ever. What is the purpose of the story if it doesn?t have anything to do (or at least have an interesting reason for?) with anything?    . If this was a book I read about an old woman who gets hit by a car and goes to the hospital, and they want to make the whole thing about a hospital then this is a book for you. You can have a laugh about her old lady troubles while you're on a trip. You might even like the characters in the hospital more than she does. And you can have an "oh hey there's my old lady" type of scene.   and it's funny   but seriously, why is it that whenever a girl is in trouble she always ends up getting hit

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never read anything by David Markson that I disliked. He has an interesting take on the history of the Second World War. My problem with the book was that he seemed to think that the Germans were better soldiers than the French (or Poles) who were fighting for the same reason.   The history he writes is so dry it is embarrassing.  There were some good points to the book, including his point that if we had been in France in 1940, we would have fought for a different course of action, but his point is that if the French had fought for something less than full control of the country, we might have fought to save the status quo.  I do not know how much longer Markson will write about this war, but he could write an entire book on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's good, but not great. The plot has promise, but the characters are extremely shallow. The book is good and I'd recommend it for that reason. But there are so many more important books I'd like to read, and some of the main characters just weren't very interesting or fun to read about. I'll definitely pick up some more books from this author in the future though. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate that the only two men on the whole team have this weird fixation with her, the other woman on the team.   "Hey, look, they're gonna marry her!"   This is why I only liked the first four of the series, but am hoping this ends up being a trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a classic example of how to use a genre to do some light, witty, fun, and educational criticism.   I'm pretty sure that this book would be a classic in it's own right, but it is still fun, clever, and thought provoking.  One of the greatest aspects about the book, and perhaps my favorite in a series of short stories, is how it utilizes many of the tropes, clichés, and clichés that we are used to seeing in science fiction and fantasy.  Although the main premise is pretty simple, the story is actually quite complex in terms of how it's structured.  The concept of a group of travelers being trapped on an unknown world that was once inhabited by an ancient race is both interesting and unexpected, and it is easy to see where the inspiration for the book came from.  I think that the story would have benefited from a little less explanation as to what exactly is going on, but overall it is a fun, entertaining, and well-written short story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to love this book.   This story is about a man who is trapped in a mental institution for about 10 years. When his family moves to the country, he gets a job, and as part of the job he goes to a psychiatrist to see if he is a good person.  The psychiatrist doesn't tell the man he's mentally ill.  Instead, he tells him to just get over the depression and live a normal life, but the man thinks about killing himself as he is living in a very lonely place.  Unfortunately, I had to put this book down before it was over as I felt sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of articles published from 1999 to 2003 about how to use and play the Nintendo 64, which has the advantage of allowing for easy online access to classic and modern console games. It's mostly about using the games to test your memory, the controller, and the computer. I was a little disappointed to discover that the reviews were published by Nintendo Power. The company may have been nice and courteous, but it's obvious that their "Nintendo-approved" content is a little more fan-friendly than their original content. There are several other, similar, online-only sites like Nintendo.de that offer similar information.   (In fact, I've seen several sites with "Nintendo Power" in the name. These sites have a variety of Nintendo-related info and articles, so check them out.) The "Best of Nintendo" column was not an original feature, as I found it while browsing various gaming magazines in the early 2000s. The idea is very simple: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book on a whim after a couple of books I had read and liked about a group of teenagers. The book was just what I was looking for and in many ways, this book is even better than I had hoped for. I liked that these four are going through some very hard times, and even more interesting that they do it with each other. The narration was good and kept up with the story as it progressed. I am surprised at how I enjoyed this book. It was a very nice read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the novel from a local bookseller who was selling them, and I think I was a bit early to get the ebook.

I didn't like the author as a person; I'm not a big fan of dystopian novels, and this was more of a story about the dystopian future than about a character. In any case, this book was not what I was expecting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a bad read.   It takes you through a typical story about a hero's journey but in fact you don't know what is going on until the very end, and that's when all the suspense is gone. The only things you know for certain are that the hero has an important mission (which is actually revealed in a second book, which makes it feel like an additional part of the story) and that there is some horrible, evil plot behind the events.  The characters in the book are good and fun (the main character's wife is fun), but the whole thing just feels a bit empty.  The ending is horrible.  It's the only part of this book where I think it's a bit off, but there is also a lot of information to keep from readers.  The author says that there are a lot more books in the series to be written, but given that this is only the first one I would be really interested in seeing how they do next time. What else is there to say?   There are a few other novels by the same author which I've read that are really good, but this book really just feels like a bit of a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I like to read but not like a lot.   For a newbie, this book could use some work; it is a bit too long.  This book will help you understand the different types of foods, but not all of them. The writing is somewhat clunky and hard to read. I would not be able to use this book for reference purposes.  I did like it as a new author, though, just as a primer for future work.  It was well written and did help me see the differences between different foods. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (the book is not good enough to read)   What does it mean:  What did I like:  I am a woman in my mid 20s. This was the first book I have ever picked up and read at the same time as my husband. When we are in the car with our kids, I read the book while he watches cartoons, while I read some of the stories and the action sequences and his reaction is priceless. My husband has been reading these kinds of novels lately and the stories about the mother-daughter relationship, with the mother taking care of the baby, and all the fun with the baby. I am very excited to read more stories in the series. The fact that this book was so well written, so realistic, and with an excellent narrator really sold me. How the heck do you top that? I don't know. I hope that it is just a short series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed.   The premise is so simple that you get the idea and you're hooked.  I was really excited to get this book because I love the concept and the art style of this comic.  The first book was really great, so I was hoping the second book would be more of the same.  This book doesn't disappoint, but I just didn't like the direction the story went in.  All the main characters are awesome and I love how each character is brought to life.  However, they all have a very boring relationship, which I felt robbed the book of any potential.  It was still fun and I loved the art by the way.  For my money, I just don't think this book belongs in your collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In retrospect, it's probably the worst book I've read in a long time. The plot was uninspired and I couldn't care less about it. The writing was terrible. The characters were boring and generic. There was nothing redeeming about it at all. I gave it a two instead of a five because the characters were interesting and the plot was kind of a drag. In my opinion, this book is not a masterpiece or even a decent read in any way, but more of a mediocre novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the worst thing to come out of the Harry Potter universe.   The story was not even remotely believable and the main character was a total jerk to the protagonist and the reader alike.   The characters in this book are just plain terrible:  One of the characters, the protagonist, has a secret crush on his best friend and the two are very close but only recently have started dating.  A few chapters later they are having sex and then break up.  But what the fuck, he's his best friends best friend's best friend.  What kind of asshole has to be such a douche and act like that?    The plot of the book is not only ridiculous and poorly written but the main problem is the main antagonist is a total douchebag who makes absolutely no sense.  One minute he's running around and killing wizards because he's evil and then the next minute he wants to kill the protagonist just because he thinks he's a snob (and he totally is a snobbish douche like that).  Why is he so evil?  Why would a super wizard want to kill him?  He's never shown to be as powerful as his magic makes him out to be.  He kills everyone by making them invisible and then disappears when they're all dead.  That seems a little bit too convenient.  In the book, he uses this same trick to kill another wizard.  Maybe he doesn't use it on everyone and only kills the person in the same situation as him.  Why didn't he do that?   Maybe he killed some people he knew he couldn't make invisible.    I really don't understand the point of this book.  The whole book was stupid and not even as good as the movies.  It had some good moments but just didn't come out that much better than most of the movies or other Harry Potter books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "This was a dreadful book! The author describes a character's childhood as a time when he was constantly abused. His father beat him in the face and on the genitals, repeatedly telling him he'd been born again. He went insane and committed suicide when he ran away from home. The rest of the book depicts him as an emotionally abused child until the age of thirteen. I'm not sure what the author had in mind when she invented this character, but she ended up being a terrible character and not well written." "I'm really disappointed with this book, but it's not because of the poor writing. I was expecting it to be a pretty decent book, about a kid who had a traumatic childhood and who goes into therapy to cope with the abuse he suffered. Instead I ended up thinking it was awful. I think the author may have been influenced by a film of the same name and made a bad character out of the boy she wanted to write about."    (The Author of the review above, J.L., writes: " I would have been happy with a good read about a child who had bad experience in his childhood and became an abusive parent. Instead, I felt like the author tried too hard to portray the worst parts of my own life and made me very sad. I can't think of a single good thing about this book."  )
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are only a few chapters in this book and you can almost guarantee that by the end of the book you will be wishing that you had not read this book at all. This book is all about the story and it has a great feel to it. I am disappointed in the ending as it was not what I expected. The story did not get me as excited as I thought it would so the ending left me a bit disappointed. Overall a good read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. As I said above, I enjoyed the "Fantasy," "Sci-fi" and "Western" genres, and thought the writing was quite good, but this is not one of them. As far as the "Gothic" genre goes, I would say that this book was only a little "Dark" and did not match my expectations for the genre. If a "gothic novel" should be anything close to what the title says, I can only imagine this book being much more Gothic in the end. I understand that in this genre, the reader is supposed to imagine themselves in the story, but for a story about an 18th Century English lady and her husband, the story could have been written from their perspective. The characters have not much in the way of history or depth, except the "old" Lord, and when we meet him, he is just a big old man, with no depth. This is what I mean when I say that "The Fantasy" and the "Suspense" genres can get the feel of a Victorian England but cannot keep up with modern sensibilities. As for the "Westerns," I think we can all agree that these stories can be exciting and entertaining, but there are just way too many of them here. For instance, the book was interesting but all too many "Westerners" have only one character who is a Westerner and not the other way around. The "Westerner" has to be able to fight, think, think and think. And he has to know how to kill, or she is just wasting her time. So, as much as I enjoyed reading "Fiction" and more, the "Horror" genre was just a little too over the top for my tastes, and I just didn't really like this one.   Posted by Emily at 8:48 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so very excited to get the book, but then had to wait almost a year to get it because the publishers (Amazon) were not responsive to my emails. I got the book at the last moment and it cost me another $3.00. I still am angry about the delay.   The book is interesting and I have already gone back and read the first book in the series and am enjoying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first page of this book was confusing as hell to me. As I've mentioned before, I'm a big fan of horror, and usually I don't enjoy those with a high body count. I figured it was the typical paranormal romance, but this book has a good twist, that's worth reading it. The ending is just so, so good. You can tell that the author didn't want to just write a boring and cliché love triangle, and that's exactly what she did. The mystery is done well, and I loved the fact that the characters had a history to discover, as well as a connection to the supernatural. That is why I give this book two stars instead of one, because I could be very easily disappointed if the mystery was done well. That's not something this author can do, and it's not an easy feat to pull off.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was one of my very worst books yet. I don't know why it got to be one of the best. I've read so many terrible books and this was my absolute least favorite so far. I'm not sure if I had an allergic reaction to the characters, but the story felt forced and uninteresting to me. I also couldn't stand the main characters at all, and there was almost no development to them. Not to mention that I really hated the writing style as it made the story seem very cliche at times. Overall, not much to say here. I wasn't a huge fan of the book, but I still loved the cover.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like this book very much. The story is just so unbelievable and poorly written. It is just one big bad idea after another. All the characters in it are not that much better than any one of the other characters in the other books. The only person who is not a complete idiot is the main villain, but even he can't keep his eyes open long enough to know what is going on. I mean, the villain could have saved the world by telling the world about it, but he doesn't, because that would mean that he would have to admit to the world that it would be a bad idea to do such a thing! So instead he has to keep the information from the world, and pretend that the people who could have used it did not realize what was going on and that it is not their fault! The villains in the first book were pretty much idiots. The villains and the people they are fighting are pretty much all idiots. This book has all the typical suspects for a book like this; the main bad guy was a moron, and the main hero is really a jerk (I'm not going to name names). The story seems to be trying to show the good people of the world being bad, but it is very hard to do this without using the usual suspects. The ending is pretty much a let down, especially the "I'm glad I wasn't a main character" thing. The whole thing just feels so sloppy and illogical. It just doesn't feel like a well written book at all. I guess you can see why a book would get a rating like this...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My book "Facts, Lies, and Theology" was awful! I will never buy another book by this author again! When I opened the package I was met with a terrible smell and the smell stayed with me all day. I was expecting a beautiful paperback with nice pages, but it came in a horrible box and smelled awful. My first impression was that it must be a terrible book because it smelled horrible.   It smelled like a dog's food. The pages were all wet with tears and dirt. The book didn't even feel like it had any spine!   This book just made me not want to read any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was a great idea, but was flawed in several ways. It was a good exercise in setting a framework for thinking about some of the things that we tend to think of as "natural." It also provides a nice discussion about how such natural things might change over time. As a whole, I would recommend this book to philosophers of a more or less liberal bent (myself included), and I look forward to reading it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What happened in this book?  I have to admit, this book surprised me. In fact, it almost made me laugh out loud when I finished.   This book did not disappoint.  The story is really what made me appreciate the book as much as I did. In the beginning of the book, we are introduced to a young woman who is a high school dropout and lives in a shack.  This young woman's mother has left her because of her husband's behavior.  She was never really loved and lived in a bad house. When her mother dies, she decides to move in with her father to try to be independent.   The book begins by showing a woman who has her first child, a girl.  Throughout the book she tries to make money, but is always in trouble.  Finally she goes to a church on a mission trip and learns the gospel. She starts working and tries to change.  As the story progresses, the church's pastor, Father Nevin, decides to take her along for a mission.  During their first night in a town, they meet a man who is not a part of the church.  They are shocked when the man shows them his wife.  After several days of going to different places with different missionaries, they arrive at a large church and have a very powerful experience.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a friend or relative who is depressed and just wants to talk about things in a supportive and caring way.  If you have ever been in that situation, I think this book is just what you need. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are several things I like about this book.   This book has plenty of humor, even if it's not so dryly hilarious. The book is quite entertaining, despite its dry humor. There are a lot of interesting characters in this book, and the way the author handles their stories is excellent. The main characters are a group of kids at a school in England, and they spend their days with the school's new headmistress, Ms. Egan. The kids don't get along at first, but they learn to work things out through the use of humor and some real drama.  I was impressed by the way Ms. Gedris handled a character that seemed so minor initially. I wasn't sure how I felt about this character at first because she just seemed so small, but she grew on me quickly. This book is full of the kind of funny stories that I enjoy, whether the book is dryly funny or just a little bit funnier. The story about the bad guys getting the prize at the end of the book really had me smiling. The characters and their actions are very well done.  It may not be as long as "The Magic School Bus" or "Rabbit and Co." but it is well worth the price of admission.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After the good reviews about this book, I was very excited about it, but I am now regretting it a lot. The book started out great, and then the author tries to get the reader to think she is "sane". Not only is it not really about schizophrenia but it is actually about the worst kind of schizophrenia: not the delusional type, but the psychotic type. The author is obsessed with the idea of schizophrenia as the worst thing since slavery. The worst part is that she doesn't have a cure, and doesn't want one. This is a sad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of misinformation and half-truths, but it's easy to get sucked into the details. It's a story that, when given a chance, will take you to an exciting and thrilling end. But it's the end that isn't nearly enough to make this a good book. There was some good stuff in there--some character development--but this book is mostly about how the character of Lyle (the man who is to be Lyle the hero) grew up and how his relationships with those around him (including his family) developed. This, I feel, is the kind of book that I'd want to read more of: stories with characters that develop. This isn't an enjoyable book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book at all. It's just very confusing and I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Also, there's so much in here that just makes no sense. The story about a woman who finds a ring that gives her powers that seem to be based on magic spells but isn't is a lot of over-the-top nonsense that I just can't get behind. A little too much information about the world, the history, and some really lame characters. I can't say it's worth the read, but it's not bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not that my favorite book is bad. I love Harry Potter and its series. I liked it a lot, but it was really slow to get to know the characters. I found Harry a bit bland and had a hard time caring about him until the very end. I was ready to start again with the next book and then I got a very short break. That was too bad. So the next time I picked up it, I felt cheated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a little skeptical but the books I've read by the author seem real. This book is no exception.     First of all, this book is so wrong and the ending was terrible.  "In all my travels, I have never encountered a creature so hideous as this beast. It has four long, sinuous arms, and two massive claws in its fists. It looks like a large, angry bear, but its eyes are green, and I have the impression that the beast has lost its teeth."       "We followed it for the next few hours, with a heavy heart, until its claws had begun to dig into the wood. The little house of my friend, the one he and his sister used as a home during the war, looked like a scene from a horror movie. The house was full of holes, its windows shattered. I watched from the front porch, as the beast began to devour the house. But then I heard it. It came from beyond the woods. It was just a few feet away from the house, and as it approached, I could smell its vile breath. The beast reached the house and charged at me. I dived for the door, but then it turned around. My heart jumped as I saw that it was the beast's twin. I cried out in terror and fell backwards. The door slammed shut behind me. There was a loud thud. The creature then left the woods."   I am seriously having a hard time reading about this book because it is so bad! I think I will give this book to my sister, but I have to be honest. The cover is terrible, and it doesn't help that I have only seen this book at the bookstore. I am not going to be purchasing this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not read all of the books in this series, and I'm just now starting them. However, I'm already sad that they were all so poor.   This series was so bad I actually wanted to vomit. I've seen a few books that were so bad they turned me off the whole genre. This is the worst I've ever seen from the genre and I don't understand why it's in the Hall of Fame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book on a whim, in hopes of a good read. As it turned out, I just got a bad experience. I wanted to give this book two stars, but it's too bad because it was really fun. I will definitely read the next one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   ...   (5/10)   This is one of those rare books that I found in an inexpensive used book store. It has a strong emotional pull, and a simple yet compelling narrative with a beautiful cover. I read this as an early teens, and have been thinking about it since. This was probably the best book on the topic of the death of a child.   There were some points that I disagree with, and the book does fall apart on a couple of points. I would have given this 4.5 stars, but for some reason I am a bit more concerned with the lack of a cover image, or the small number of characters in the novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book expecting to be entertained by it, but I was disappointed. The premise sounds fun, but it just doesn't hold up. In fact, the whole story just seemed very weak and boring.  I have read some really great stuff about people being the center of the universe, such as "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and "Caveat lector" but I have never seen such a dull and silly premise. It's almost as if the author is trying to write a good story for the kids, but he just can't quite get there. I have only given this book a three, but that is for the simple fact that I did not have the patience to read it and enjoy it. I do not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is simple - you have to escape a prison. Unfortunately, you don't have the keys to open the cage. Instead you find keys in a small storage box.   It's easy enough to pick the correct key but you find that there are more of the same keys in the box and you can't find your way back out. This is an odd story but I'm not sure what's wrong with it. I enjoyed it a little bit but it's not the best. I would probably rate it 2 stars, however, I think it is worth the read if you like the idea of a lock-picker.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read one of these books, and not in the slightest. It's a very bad book, I say that with no slight, even though I have the hardcover (and the Kindle edition), both versions in good shape. It starts with the typical story of a boy with a very difficult home life, but a great relationship with his mother and father, and then is just a terrible book on a whole. The story is very confusing, and very boring. A lot of things are said that I didn't understand, and I didn:t care to get into. The protagonist has the same problems that the whole family does, and it doesn't make sense. For me, as a mother, to have such a child, that would have me in such a terrible relationship with him, just doesn't seem right. I have been through the same, just as his father, so I can relate to him on some of this, but it's still just so wrong. It was too long (around 600 pages), and too confusing for me, but I'm still hoping for a good sequel because this just doesn:t work at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are a fan of the series and enjoy the story, I can say that I found this book to be quite enjoyable. This book does not follow the main storyline, but the author has done a good job in explaining how these events are linked together. The book is well written, although the book may not be for all readers. This is a very slow paced book, and is more of a mystery/thriller type of book. The story is enjoyable, but there are times when I feel that the author may have rushed the book or put too much into the story. Although the story can be enjoyed, the characters are not well developed or given enough screen time to develop their personality. I enjoyed this book quite a bit. However, my rating for the book has been increased due to the fact that there were a few changes that I noticed. I would suggest that this story may not appeal to some people. The only reason I gave the book 3/5 was because the author had taken some time out of his busy schedule to do a special interview for the author's book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing on this book is awful and the story is boring, like most of the books in this genre. You can read this book, but it'll make you want to toss it across a room. The story starts with a dead body, then proceeds to a man who's been missing since 1975. I'm not saying that it's a good mystery, but I don't know how you could have made this book better than it already is.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . I've read through three of his books and have yet to finish them all, but for all I know there are some more he has yet to write. He can be quite a pain to work with.   I've heard horror stories about his behavior towards other writers.  He really wants you to do your research.  I don't buy what he is selling.  What I've come to appreciate about the guy, as I have been trying to do so since I started reading, is that he doesn't waste your time trying to convince you he's better than you are, or that his is better than yours.  No, he doesn, instead, find the little things that make you feel different than you do.  So no, I don't buy it, and I don' t need it.  That said, there were a few moments of brilliance within the book. I would recommend it if you want to learn something about the history of a certain genre or approach to writing. I will definitely be keeping a close eye on his next efforts, and looking forward to his next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think that what happened in this book was that someone took the first draft and just kept editing it till it was what they wanted it to be and then threw out the rest.   This is what happens with a lot of books that are published.  They have been rewritten a thousand times and put together in whatever order they can.  The author needs to realize that they do not own their work, and that it belongs to the readers.  One more thing about authors and book marketing:  The problem with author marketing is that it is so easy to do.  There is an idea behind the book, there is a cover, there are book titles, and there is some kind of blurb.  It's a great way to sell books.  And then you can get lots of books to the top of the charts because everyone will want to read your book.  But then the thing that bothers me is that the books that get on the top are just the latest and greatest from the author's previous books.   But there is no reason for that.  As long as the author knows how to create a good book, then who cares what the marketing people think?  But the more books they write, the less value they will have to give to the customers.  A writer should have the book out in the hands of the customers at the start, so they can make a proper evaluation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would never read this book again. I had expected the characters to be complex and to grow, but this book never reaches any of that. The world building is done well, but there is not any exploration of that or other aspects of the world (or any other books, for that matter). The story follows a very stereotypical hero archetype who is a good person but has a dark side, a side that is rarely explored.   I felt like the hero was very uninteresting. His first book is not a good start and the rest of the book is very dull. He loses his wife, who has been sickly for years. He can't bear to be apart from her, especially as she has always been the most important person in his life.  , but he's not a bad person. He's just very selfish and doesn't feel love or affection for anyone else. In a good novel I feel that the protagonist would at least see that his wife is a person and a good mother, but here he doesn't see a good father and he never sees a mother who doesn't need a father. There is also a lack of good relationships in the book. It is also not a happy ending. A good story has a happy one, and the characters in this book were not.The last part of the story has him get involved with another woman who is not the same as the first. It's kind of a mess because she is the exact opposite of what he was before, but it's good to see a man get some happiness for once. That's not the end of the plot though, as there is a big twist at the end. It was done very poorly because the twist is so stupid and boring. The plot wasn't bad, but the way it was told was.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed by the novel, I had high hopes for it and the characters but the novel failed on every level.The writing was terrible. The plot wasn't very compelling, the characters were generic and bland and the ending left a lot to be desired. It was so bad I just wanted to throw it out. Also it is about an incestuous relationship. I was hoping for a relationship that was more like the ones depicted in "The Giver", "Mulan" or "A Tale of Two Cities". This book had all of those in spades. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book but when I read it over again it was not as exciting as the first time I read the book.   This book takes place in the future and focuses on the future of mankind but it feels more like a prequel. I know we will never live in the distant future but it would have been cool to see what kind of technology we would have in the 20th century. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It wasn't the first or only bad book that I've had to read.   But it was the worst, and it was also one of the most painful to read in the last 2 or 3 years of my life.  The character in question is a very unlikable and poorly written one.  In addition, this book is just awful, as much as the characters.  If you've been reading the same type of books for the last several years, and haven't been able to find anything that has changed with the trends or the times, this one is the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very happy to get my hands on this book but it is NOT worth the wait. As others have mentioned the story is pretty basic but the writing is very poor. For the book it reads as if it was written in the 70's but with the added benefit that the characters' names are still funny and the characters are all over the place. The book is very slow going and not really worth the time to read. I've given it 2 stars because there were several interesting parts but the overall writing is just a big let down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book multiple times. The characters are the best part of the book. When they are together they are very fun. I am not an expert on the characters so please don't read me as one. I do have a few quibbles with the book though. I know the book goes into detail about the world the characters live in. It does not make the world any less relatable to me or to others. This book will also confuse younger readers who read the same book as me. The main characters are introduced in the middle of a series of other books, so they don't always stay together. There is a scene where one of the characters is in a coma. There are several other books about a coma in which the coma character is in, but it isn't explained. It isn't necessary to understand the story to enjoy the book and I wasn't interested in following the plot line. There were several characters in the story that were not as well-developed. One character was described as a child molester. Another character was a bully that was described by a boy in a similar situation as a friend and brother. The book also lacks a good villain. The story of the main character and some of the other characters was pretty dark but I would be willing to read a book about a child molesting bully. I guess the world of the author isn't so big to accommodate some of her characters' flaws, but I could see it in other authors. I read a short story on a different website about a girl that was molested by a teacher. I wouldn't be upset to read about a person who was molused as a kid but there are enough details and characters that make me feel like the author has a personal connection to her characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has no value to me. I found the plot to be pointless, with a lot of character development happening out of nowhere. The author uses the same characters over and over to build the plot (and I can see why, since the book is basically about a man trying to survive in a world that has changed). When you think about it, the book just has a lot less to offer than a few words in a book could.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a mediocre book, written by a mediocre writer, with mediocre characterizations, with a mediocre plot. I'd give it three stars, but I can't do that to a book that doesn't live up to its own hype. It's not bad writing (I liked the story) or mediocre writing (the characters were poorly written) or a bad plot (I didn't care for the ending) or bad characters (they were bland), or a weak plot (there was little to like about this book) or any of the other adjectives one can use to describe a bad or mediocre book.    The story:   This book is all about a boy who goes missing while out on a run. He's eventually found and brought back to his parents, who take him home to their small farm. He doesn't have a problem with his father, his mother seems to like him, and his brother seems to want nothing to do with him. But when a strange boy named Max steals their corn, it turns the young family on each other.  This book was written by the same author as The Raven and the Thief. (I think I've read this book. The last three books have been published within the past few years. The title is on the front cover.  I liked the first book, but this one is kind of disappointing.  The characters seemed like they had enough personality, but they weren't fleshed out enough.  It was kind of like the two children on a farm who are never seen interacting with each other and who end up always fighting.   It felt like the author didn't give this novel any real direction (like in the first three books, which were all very clear and interesting).  I think that the problem was that he only had four or five main characters.  When I read the first two books in the series, I really enjoyed them.  But the last three were really weak.  In the first books, I thought the main characters had something about them, and I loved the mystery they were solving.  Here, they don't.  They get off on the wrong foot the entire time and don't really interact with each.  At times, Max gets all of the best lines.  Other times, there are a lot of lines from the girls, but no one really seems to care about their issues with the boys.  That said, there were some cute moments between the boys and

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book. It is boring and full of clichés.   The main character is so passive aggressive that it is almost sadistic.  The characters are so stupid and one has such an ego that they can't just let their parents die because they have a daughter who is a princess.   "There's only so much you can do when you're just another person in the way of their life. There's only a certain amount of time you can waste, just waiting for your mother to die. Maybe it would be easier if she was still alive..."  I'm disappointed that the author didn't add something more to this book, I was looking forward to a more unique and exciting novel, this book feels like the author just wrote a bunch of words and went for the easy way out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The "The Little Prince" book by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry that has been described as "The Bible in English" (or should I say the "Little Testament in English")  "The Little Testament in French", by Antônio de Lobo. This book in translation is a book to read while listening to music.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *spoiler alert* The main character is a bitch. She's in the wrong place at the wrong time and she doesn't do anything about it. (Well, she does try to do something about it, but she fails. It's kind of frustrating.) The whole thing is a setup for the book's conclusion that I won't be able to finish.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You get what you pay for with this one! I'll start with this fact. This book will give you a headache. This has to be my favorite book in the world right now. It's a very entertaining read and I've enjoyed it so far. I am a huge fan of science fiction/fantasy and this is by far the best of the bunch. I also love to read books with a good storyline. This one is just awesome! There is an awful lot going on in this book and it's very hard to figure it all out. I'm also very happy to report that it's written in the third person! You get the feeling that a character is really close to the main character. And it all works. You just have to be willing to follow along. The plot is pretty much a mess but it works on a lot of levels. You're never really sure what's going on but it's all quite interesting. A very entertaining book. I hope this book makes it to my collection at some point. Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think that the authors should know that most people who read books are not going to love them. This book, however, for whatever reason, is so good that it has a certain appeal, regardless of who reads it. It's a very well written, entertaining book, and the author was able to show the various points in the life of a teenager, even if they are a little farfetched. My main complaint is that the book is a little too long, especially the last quarter. I think there would have been more to the story if it was just a short story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was not what I expected.   The story was well done but the author's voice was not mine.  For a book that should have been very good, I expected a different story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book but   It is way too long to be entertaining.   The story is mostly about a character and his relationship with a female.  What the hell?  The characters are really boring and   In most of the book they are just standing around making out and talking.  In a normal book this would not be so bad, but  it   This is a big fat waste of time.    The only good part of the story is the end and in that part of it  there are some very nice, witty lines  that you can just smile at.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an old book with an old author. I think I should read the first book, which I bought, because it's got so much more detail, a good plot and a strong heroine (and not the "dork" kind). In fact, I think she's too interesting. She's smart, witty, kind, and can get away with being bad about what she likes and how she lives. I loved her best friend, and I also love the way she makes the boys love her--she's too good for this kind of love. I love the fact that she can take a good guy (Jared) and make him into the best friend she ever had. And the way the author is so smart about what a boy should do and what he shouldn't (for example: "She was not too hot, but I thought she was pretty, just not quite as hot as I was, which was a bit disconcerting").  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I could give the novel a zero star rating, but this book is just so bad it makes me want to read the original books in the series.     I've already read the second book and I feel cheated by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great story with some twists to keep you interested!   My favorite aspect about the book is the characterization of each character in the story.   The way the characters' stories play out is so interesting.  I have never been a fan of the series but, after reading this book, I think I'm starting to get behind it a bit more.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a waste of time to read this book. The first half is a typical first half with a lot of "the old stuff is the best" clichés. Then comes the book's main focus, the "university" section. While I have little to no sympathy for the author, I understand his point of view and appreciate the effort. However, the book became boring and repetitive when I was reading, after the initial 20 minutes I would only be reading about what the author wants to write about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The cover was cool, but the content wasn't. The main character gets superpowers and has to spend a year training before being able to do anything. But then... he does nothing. In fact, he is a total dork. He has a lot of fun when he goes on adventures, but he's a total non-conformist.   This book had a lot to do with the concept of being the ultimate nerd.  So what is this guy? He's a genius, a former super-villain, and the star of his high school's "Quiz Bowl." In other words, he's the ultimate "Cool Guy."   But in the book, he only does dumb things that don't have any real world impact. He goes off on adventures without his best friend and tries to get out of doing things to save the world. But it all gets back to him when he realizes he has no real friends or a girlfriend. He's like a child who always thinks he's better than everyone else.  I mean, he gets the power of super-strength. Sure he could become a superhero, but you can't just use that power on everyone else so he is more or less just a bully to everyone else while being the smartest guy at school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first book in the series by Patrick Ness. I can see why he got the book for an M.F.A. He clearly knows what he is doing. The book is a good and interesting read. There are a few flaws in it, but nothing major and the good points outweigh it. The writing is very good and it has its own voice which the author does a good job with. The main characters are a little annoying, but it's understandable if they want to get something out of it. I'd be interested to see a sequel though. The ending is the one thing I wasn't sure about and it made me angry. It was kind of a drag, but not as bad as I thought it would be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was a bit slow, the plot had too much going on in it, there was not enough action in the book and a lot of the characters were not that interesting.   However, the ending was not all that bad and the final scenes were very nice and heart warming.  Somewhere down the line (after I finished the book), I read an interview with a guy who has read the book multiple times.  I think this guy's book was a lot less successful than the first one.  He had the same problem with the plot as I did, the story was slow and the story itself was slow.  However there was more action in this one and the characters where more likable.  But this book did not help me fall in love with anything.  It was just too slow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first came across this book I did not know what to think. I'm not a huge fan of "tragedy" novels but the story seemed very genuine, moving, and, well, tragic. As I read it, I kept asking myself: "what's wrong with this woman?" The book itself isn't perfect, and I have to admit that it's probably not realistic, but it's so well written and so moving that I just couldn't help it.   I'll be honest: there was definitely something missing from this book that is a little bit hard to explain. The main character's behavior makes a certain amount of sense. She suffers from a lot of depression and is often on the verge of suicide. However, I had never noticed her lack of empathy before and she did not seem very human in this book. At first, I thought she was just "being crazy," but the behavior didn't seem like it was rooted in reality. After all, the whole idea of this book is that we all have things we would rather not remember, and in many cases we'd rather remember them than live them, so she was being crazy for feeling so bad.   the main character is still in denial over the fact that her mother is actually in a terrible mental health situation, but she starts realizing what has happened, and tries to deal with her mother's death with a little more dignity than she usually does. (It doesn't seem realistic that someone's mother would commit suicide; however, if this were a realistic book it would be believable that someone would have actually died).   After a while, I realized I really liked this book a lot. It really gave me a lot to think about in the process. I can't say that this was the perfect book because there were some flaws and the characters felt a little flat and that's something I wish I could've explained better. However I really did enjoy the story. And I do have to say that the author was a good sport about her characters and their suffering. I felt the need to ask her questions just because I loved them so much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm writing this review after reading a number of reviews about this book: so many good reviews, so many bad reviews. The main problem is, this book just wasn't good. The worldbuilding was ok, the characters were ok, but the plot was just... no good.  It's a very different type of fantasy, a world which is a lot like our own, but where the elves don't have a language, the goblins are the new gods, the dwarves have an incredibly high caste system and the trolls are literally demons, all brought together through magic. This is an odd mix of themes: magic, elves, trolls, dwarves, religion and politics.   The problems with this book include: the worldbuilding is all over the place, the world is a very dark and violent place, but it's one where there is still magic, where elves, gods and goblins exist and are powerful but where they don't speak, where the gods have a massive cult that worship them and are dangerous and yet the ones who don't are hated by them for not understanding them. This book is one of those novels where the world building is so poorly constructed that it's completely confusing; I didn't understand why there was a high caste or why a demon would want to kill a human, and I felt like I'd spent a decade in the middle of the book only to have a complete change of plot at the end.  Another problem is that there is a completely different plot going on that the book is exploring, and that plot just isn't very compelling.  The ending was also kind of weird.  I don't know why people who like the series like this book so much, but I just didn't really care about the book much at all.  Phenomena by David Eddings. I have seen these authors praised before for their plots and worldbuilding but in truth, none of their books are very good, except for the ones in the Amber series where it is very easy to see what is going on and follow along.  Phenomena is a great book about a young mage that was raised as a mage and is forced to become a warrior at a young age.  In a very weird way, I think this book is a good representation of a young boy growing up as a boy.  He has no interest in magic and can't read or write, and is just a good kid that has been mistreated all his life. But
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is not good enough.   What happened in this story is a bad dream.  It is impossible for me to understand how such a bad story is published in a great book.  I give it a one star instead of four. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to prepare for a class on contemporary fiction, and I was quite impressed with the quality of the book.  The writing was easy to follow and the themes were interesting. However, the author makes some basic mistakes in the book that can be found in some books written by good authors.  I felt that this book did not give me the information I needed and I didn't really feel as though I understood the book well enough to be able to discuss it in class.   This is my second book by John McPhee.  My last book was about the "American Dream," and he has done a good job with this one.  It is just a shame that he had to have an entire chapter devoted to some sort of urban myth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It started out very good. I really liked the story, the characters and the setting. However, the book fell apart near the end. The plot kept getting further and further away from the main story, and the characters were not in the main plot at all. This book could have been good if the story didn't go so off the track, but it still was a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of my least favorites of the "Lost Legion" series. I think I was expecting too much from it and not enough of the original "Legion" stories from TSR. The book focuses on characters who weren't around back in the 60's. This is also another case of the book being just another of a series. There is a reason they started over. The books are just not as good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried this book because I am not into sci-fi and thought I'd try one. I am very pleased with my decision. It's a good read but a bit long for a single book. I'm disappointed that the narrator wasn't much more than a narrator. I found the writing really good. I also enjoyed the illustrations and was pleased with how the story ended. There are three books in this collection and it seems like they all flow together nicely. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I was not really enthused with this book. The book is a good look at the life of an ordinary person. He is, however, nothing special. As a scientist, he tries to find a way to communicate the mystery of the universe to the general public, using the scientific method. The problem is that he can't help but feel like a charlatan in his experiments. One could argue that he is in reality a fraud. But the story he tells is, in my opinion, pretty interesting. I enjoyed it, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As someone who grew up on the '70s and '80s, The Wild Wild West (1973) is a favorite of my childhood.   When I was in high school, I used to read this book over and over, and it was just so fun, and I didn't feel like there was anything bad about it at all.  I just found the story fascinating to be so much more exciting than the books I used and the movies that I saw on tv.  The only problem I had with the book was that it had this horrible plot twist in the final chapters, which took away all suspense from the book and made it a boring read.  Other than that, I would recommend this book to all my friends.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the epitome of awful.   The prose is terrible. The story is the worst.  The plot is horrible.  There are some characters that are flat.  I would never want to read this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book, but a terribly written book that reads like someone just made a quick story out of a random occurrence. I didn't like the story that the narrator told, nor did I enjoy reading about the characters and their problems in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The cover is good. The story has a lot of things going for it (I've heard this kind of book before and it was ok), but the plot is pretty bad. I understand the story is about a family that is in a bind and needs to help each other out in a few different ways, but the only one that works is the family's son being able to hear the voice of his dead father. I know that sounds lame but if you are looking for a family oriented story with a twist, read this book. The rest is crap. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was ok, I did like the main character more though he was a bit dull. The book got bad reviews because it felt like some books were in the same category (like that one where he had to find a place to sleep) and some books had to be told in different ways but the ending was a great one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this book left me feeling cheated out of my money. It's a very long book, with some fantastic stories, but, it's really a mess. It was written as a'series of vignettes', but the whole thing becomes more convoluted and not very coherent the longer it goes on. This book is also over a century old, so it's missing many of the more current developments in the science of cancer and treatment, including the development of the new drug Herceptin. It also relies heavily on quotes from old papers from medical journals, and I had to dig through the original articles to find out why the author was making these statements. On the whole, the book is an entertaining read, but I can't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author claims to have "been a vegetarian since the time of the ancient Greeks", but he's a big eater who's got very little sympathy for vegetarians, and he spends more time complaining about other people than talking about his own eating habits.   There are a few good vegetarian stories in the book, but in this case I would have preferred to read more about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book, had a good time, but was disappointed by the writing style and content. It is basically a description of an encounter with a group of people whom the author (who was very much alive during the time the events in the book took place) said were part of a group who used to live in the city. They were partiers, drinking, gambling, womenizing, and generally behaving as drunk, boorish, and arrogant people do. But they were not bad people. In fact, when they drank they were actually quite nice to a fault. The author said they were part-time people, doing hard manual labor, so they were good, good people.   They are a group that lived on the outskirts of a large city for a long time, and they had a nice little way of life, very pleasant, and had some good qualities. But when their children went to college, the neighborhood changed and they moved away, leaving their house to deteriorate. They left behind lots of personal belongings (including a lot of stuff that they should have kept, but didn't). The author claims that they had been left to their own devices and weren't very good with money or possessions (at least that's what they say in the preface to the book.) The author also claims that their children were raised in a strict fundamentalist faith, which is what the rest of their story is based on. But I can tell you that none of that is true. The children were not brought up in a rigidly conservative religion. They didn't really go to church. They weren't strictly religious in any way. They did spend a lot (most of their time) playing games. They played lots of board games, card games, and other games with their friends. They would play games with other adults (they didn't play with adults from other religions). One of their games was "Dice Masters," where you have to keep track of every single die that is rolled, so you can play the games all over again when you lose.  The game "Dime Bags" is also a favorite, because it is such a great way to teach people to play games.  If the children had been raised in an orthodox Christian or Buddhist way, it would be fine for them. It would not be an argument for the world being run by an evil God. But the author claims they never had any contact with other religions. The kids were never
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself was not bad. I was excited to get into this book but after I started I felt like the whole book was really unnecessary. This book did not explain the book properly. The main plot line was about the four girls in the book. The book gave a little bit of info about the two main characters but nothing about other characters. The one thing I really liked about the book was the main characters. They were likeable. However, they also were pretty cliche characters. One of the main female characters was the narrator (my name is Emily), who was kind of annoying. Another main female character was a very bad and annoying character named Sara. This was a good book because there were several themes to it. It gave the girls some depth but it also had a little cliche.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been searching for this book since it came out. It's an excellent book about the creation of the world. It was written in a way that makes it easy to understand the history and the scientific method. The writing is very clear and informative. It also contains a nice little description of the different religions that are in existence in the world today. One thing I think is a big problem is the author never mentions the Christian religion. I think it is very important that the readers know about the Christian religions as it is one of the main sources of the scientific discoveries that we have today. I recommend this book to everyone interested in the history of science and religion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So disappointed in this book. It was really bad and a waste of money. It's all about the author's love of books, so he goes to see books on his own time, so that he can go into his collection and read about books. He's pretty much always in the library, and even his books are pretty much books he has read a thousand times. There's no real story, and there's no plot. It basically comes down to him reading books for his personal enjoyment and his desire to be well read. He is very nice, but he is completely oblivious to what he is doing. This book is mostly about his personal journey, so you spend a whole book just reading about how great his collection is, and then he spends a whole chapter explaining that this means he's a nice guy and that there's more to the story than the "this book is about me." I hate that I spent all this money on the collection, but it was so nice to be able to have it back for something like this. He spends a ton of time reading about books, and he can't seem to write anything himself because he's so fascinated by them. I wish it was more original and didn't revolve around his personal interests, but whatever.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the worst book   I've ever read.   The main character seems to be a character who should be written as a very sarcastic asshole.  He is so self aware and sarcastic, it's amazing that he actually manages to be one.  This main character is the reason   all the other characters are so bad.  It's like he had to be that character in order for the other bad guys to be bad. I thought the whole book was about him coming to terms with his evil nature and it ended up just being a bunch of generic super villains fighting one another.  And the writing is terrible. I actually hate how he is written.  But for me, the worst part of this book is how they have the characters act towards each other, like they have to be in a relationship and that's the way they're always going to act. It's so cheesy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've heard so many people rave about this book (and I agree) but it's been sitting on my shelf in a bag, I really didn't want to read it.  I'm glad I read it though, the writing is great and the stories are pretty good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a bad read. It's a good review: I read this book in November last year. I was excited to hear that another book was being published and was so excited that I purchased the book and started reading it. The book started with a quote from the prophet Joseph Smith. He said, "We will not go to heaven without this, that we repent of our sins." After a good amount of reading and learning about the religion I began to feel uncomfortable with the religious aspect. In the middle of the book I realized I was reading a book written by a woman and not a man. The woman is always the one preaching, and this is the last chapter in the book, she starts to preach about how there is only one way to heaven, and I thought she was going to be talking about that, but she starts saying that only men are supposed to go to God. She talks about women being lesser than men and then goes onto the subject of men going to heaven and how men are going to go there to sin and then to be punished. I started getting uncomfortable. When I started reading the book again after the next day I realized the book is meant to be for women. This is why it's not for me. I am a man and have a lot of sexual needs, and there were times when the book kept pushing the boundaries of my sexual comfort. I kept thinking the woman was talking about me. It felt like she was trying to manipulate me, and it did not sit well with me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't understand the problem with this book. I love everything about it.   Unfortunately, it's not very good.  As stated above, the story line is very interesting. It's also very well written.  The action sequences are really exciting.  However, the way it's written is very cliche.  This isn't an original idea.  It doesn't seem to be well thought out or thought out well.  In addition, the characters aren't very original.  I thought they would be more interesting than they ended up being.  Overall, it was a good story but I could have done without the cliched dialogue.  4.5/5 (out of 5)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book about 5 years ago, while waiting for a book to be released. The book was about a girl who goes to school to learn how to drive. It was so bad, that I gave it up after a few chapters. This review is not written about a book I read years ago; it is about a new book I recently read, called "What Do You Want Me To Tell You" by Eileen Myles.   Myles starts out writing about her family, her family tree, and her upbringing. Then, she opens up about her sexual issues and how she was abused by her father, which made her think about her own childhood. She then goes into her thoughts about her relationship with her father.  My hands down favorite moment in the book is her ending the book telling her father about her father's abusive behavior and his abuse of her. She says that she doesn't like him, but she wants to make it up to him by loving him, and then telling him how much she loves him. I was totally inspired and think to myself, "She has my number!"   The best part of this book is the relationship between the mother and daughter; they really get along.  I've had a friend for a while, who has always been very distant and cold toward me and even asked me what I want, or if I'm attracted to anyone, and I can't understand her behavior. This book really touched me because it was about my own family issues. It made me think about what is happening in my own life, and what I have to do to be happy.  Eileen, what an amazing book! I just started reading it, and can't wait to get through it!

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I'd read this book. I can't say that it was a good book in any way because it was just terrible. I would not recommend this book to anyone but if you can't take the bad with the good, you'll like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading the second book in this series and I just cannot get into it, it was so badly written it made me want to rip the pages out and throw them in the garbage. I hate this book. Not only did it take too long to get to the plot, but every character seemed to be completely useless. It was almost as if the author took all the strengths from the first book and added nothing to it and threw in a bunch of weak characters. I wish he would have stuck with the same characters for the next book. A few characters were nice, but none of them had anything to do with the plot at all. If you have read the first one you will know what I'm talking about. I know this book had nothing to do do with any of the previous books so I really don't know why I kept reading it. I mean, who reads a series just because the first two books are so good? But I did, so I'm paying my money anyway.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst thing about this book is the fact that it is completely unnecessary and unhelpful.  It's like they made a poor excuse for a "bad book"  by making the "bad" parts about the narrator (not that there's anything wrong with him but I thought he was so boring throughout the book) and the way that he handles himself as a narrator (that's why the "good" parts were so good).  Even if we ignore the narrator, it's still just another boring book.    Overall Rating: 3 out of 5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book on a short sabbatical from grad school in the last year. I enjoyed the first few chapters but they started to go down hill, and the main characters became less interesting. The author really wanted to show her "story" but it just ended up being a sad tale about the author's disappointment in the end.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a bit skeptical about this book and I had to give it a go. However, the book was so poorly written I thought the author was attempting to pass off a poorly written story as a good book. This is not the case.   I got the book on a recommendation from another book club member, so I expected it to be well written. However I was so disappointed with the writing I wanted to give this book a zero. The only thing I like about the book is it is not a hard work of fiction. This book is a poor excuse for a novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first reading of the book was horrible. I was bored and didn't like the characters. I'm not going to recommend it to anyone that wants a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a kid with a disease that he will probably get worse and it gets him a special toy that could save his life. The toy is a toy that only children are allowed to have. The kid wants to play with it as he is sick, but the teacher (his mom) doesn't think the toy is appropriate and will not let him. He tries to explain to her that he knows the rules about toys, but she will not believe him. What the hell.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending of the book was completely unsatisfying. It took me back to an ancient culture, and what I thought was just a typical fantasy ended up being a rehashing of old ideas about magic. The ending, which is essentially the introduction to a new fantasy world and the beginning of a new trilogy, was not worth the effort for me. Recommendation:  Maybe if you like dragons or magical swords and spells, or if you really enjoy magic, this might be your cup of tea. It is definitely worth a shot, if you love epic fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's about this guy who thinks he's a superhero. He was an astronaut, but he's got a bad back. So he comes back to earth and is now a janitor for a big bank. He comes home and the woman who was his best friend, who was like his mother. He is the only person she trusts. She can't even say hi to him because he is a janiter and they are always cleaning up. He has a big fight with his girlfriend that is pretty much all he has left. There is a nice plot twist at the end, but I was kind of disappointed by the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my favorite books! It's full of amazing and funny characters!   The story is so well thought out and the world is one of the most exciting I have read.   The first thing I thought when I picked up the book was "it's a children's book!!!"   Unfortunately, I didn't love it, and was put off by how much I felt the story was lacking in emotion, and a bit cheesy. But, I'm so glad I read it at all, even if I didn''t love it.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to read that the sequel, The Last Book of The Sun, came out a year after the first book.  It's now available on Amazon as well as Barnes and Noble.  I think I enjoyed this one much more than the first.  The stories are funnier, the characters are fleshed out, and it's just a more enjoyable read. It also has a nice ending. The only real criticism I have for this book is the author didn't write a third book in the series.  Even if he didn't, I still would've enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book because I really liked the book on the shelf at a nearby store. The book that I received, however, was a different book altogether. The first part of the book, titled "Gods of Babylon," tells the history of ancient Babylon, the civilization, where God resides as the King, is a god, but never shows him as one of the major personalities of the society. The next part of this book, "The World of the Old Testament," introduces God to the world. This part was the best part of my reading experience. I had a great time reading the introduction to the book and enjoying it. Unfortunately, I could not get enough of this part of it and was disappointed by the ending. The world of the bible was so far from anything that I had read that I was very disappointed by it. The story line for the Old covenant (when the bible started) was very interesting, but I found it to be very uneventful. This was one of those parts of the text that was more of a lecture than a story. I'm not even sure how I missed the book because it was so different. I really do not understand why I gave this book 3 stars instead of 4.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to like this book.    It had some interesting ideas and some interesting concepts, some of which I find somewhat interesting.  Unfortunately, the execution was awful.  I have a hard time understanding the logic behind some of the ideas the book advances.  Some of the "ideas" may not actually be useful at all.  The book is a little disjointed, but it is also somewhat compelling.  You will likely learn a lot of interesting things about yourself.  Also, there are some pretty interesting people to follow on this journey. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't enjoy this book at all. I did enjoy it better than the two books by the same author that I already own. This book wasn't as good as the one before it, but it's not bad at all if you like fantasy. The best part is the characters are very well written and there is lots of action. I'll definitely try another book from this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a book, and I liked it:  I read a really good book but it fell short in a lot of places. That's not an entirely bad thing; a good book can be a lot more than a good story. I like to tell people about books I like. I read "The Princess Bride" when I was about 12. I've seen the movie a dozen times and thought I knew the book before. Then one day, I discovered that it was pretty much the same story but much longer, and the music was a lot better. I still don't know the whole story. Some of it was very hard to understand. The ending was sad. But the plot kept me interested.   "This is a bad one, but it's worth a read."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing sucks. I had to go back to the beginning to read the first few chapters again to make sense of the plot. The character development is lame and the story is terrible. The author made this book about her own life, and she has no idea about how real women feel, what they experience and why it affects them so much. A few pages in, she's talking about how the men in her life, such as her boyfriend, constantly have sex with her and how they're making her feel so guilty for not giving them everything they want. Then we get this story about how she has a huge crush on a guy, but he refuses to go out with her because he's afraid she'll find out he has a crush on her. The guy she's attracted to is a real loser, but she's in no shape to stop him. I feel like I'm missing a lot of things from her life that I didn't know. It's pretty obvious in a book called "What I Saw in the Mirror" that this book isn't really about a "normal" woman's experience with the "real" world. It does try to make a comparison between a female reader of the book and a female student in a female university, but it's pretty bad. The book is a waste of time for me, and the ending made me feel like the author really doesn't get women or sex in a non-gendered way. I'm sad to give the book 4 stars, but I feel it was worth at least one star.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this book as a gift, and, despite its flaws, it was well-written, entertaining, and interesting. However, the plot is pretty dull. I understand that the book deals with a conspiracy, but the plot did not seem very original. I found myself laughing out loud more than I did when the characters did something stupid. The characterizations were fine, but I found the characters in this book to be too predictable. I also found the ending disappointing.   Posted by Stephanie at 3:04 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The bad side of this book is that it is very self-contained, and it's a little hard to see what's happening in the wider world. I don't find the story interesting enough to make me want to go back and read more, which is disappointing because it would have been nice to see more of the story, but it's really only the beginning of the problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book based on a recommendation from another friend who found the "Best Science Books" book at a used book store.   He had told me there are books similar to this, and when I saw the title I was like "no way!".   At the beginning of the book I was skeptical because I hadn't seen a good science book this long before, but I have since found good science books that have more information.  I have to say I didn't think I'd be as into this book as I am, but this book is very much about life in the modern world with a few science tidbits thrown in.  I think the author gives a good explanation about the human body and how it functions, and how people react to different stresses and conditions.  In a sense, this book offers a good review of the human mind and how the mind functions in the human race.  As I stated before, the book's goal is to look at human behavior from the inside out.  So even though the book contains a lot of science stuff, it's not like you're going to run out and learn all about the earth.  The only problem I had was that the author had a bit of a "we are all special" attitude about it, and it may be a bit cliche to you, but it wasn't my favorite part of the story.  Another problem I have is the plot of the novel seemed to be more like a fantasy.  This is fine for the book as it's just a fantasy, but as a standalone novel I felt the book was really rushed in a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a shame I don't enjoy sci-fi very much, so this doesn't exactly appeal to me. But maybe I just prefer my genre less exciting and more boring (this book does seem to be that).   I think I'm supposed to love the main character (well, one of them) and the world they live in, but this book really isn't for me.   And to be fair, the author did say at the start that he wasn't really writing about a person, but rather an idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking for something a bit light-hearted to read for the day, but found myself getting caught up in the plot.   I liked it a bit better in the second half, with the main character becoming more confident, and his relationship with the girl in his life improving, but it was the first part that caught me off guard.     The world building in this book is nice - the details are nicely done, and there are some interesting ideas about the afterlife and how it relates to humanity, but the characters were a bit too simplistic and the plot a bit boring for my taste.   The author is a little over-the-top at times, but overall, it is not bad.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If this book wasn't written by a child, I don't think I could ever be so disturbed as to hate it.   But I have no doubt that if I was a 12 year old boy I would be going through my book shelves screaming   "This is a horrible book, get the hell off my shelf!!"   What would be the point of writing a book when a 12 y.o boy can't be bothered to finish it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I have to admit that I've been waiting for this book for quite a while. This book is very well done. There's not much action, but that's not a bad thing. The story is well told, the characters are well developed, and there's a certain sense of humor in this book. That said, it's a slow burn, and you'll have to slog through quite a few chapters to get to the meat. It also has some very disturbing scenes and the occasional rape.   It's a good read, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in about an hour. And that's saying something. This is a very, very dry, uninspiring book. Not because it is a terrible book (I'm a big fan of Marko Kloos's work) but because it just didn't seem to really grab me. I don't know if this is a case of too little, too late for me but if you don't read the first book in the series or anything that's directly related to it I'm not sure you'll like this book. But if you have a chance and haven't read that, well, you're going to be really disappointed. The only reason I'm giving this a 3.5 is because I really really really wanted to like this one. And if you like Marko's writing style and are looking for an interesting, dry fantasy novel I'd give this a look. It's not great, but it's not terrible. It is what it is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books ever written. When it gets to the end, I felt that I had spent the entire book trying to find a different point of view to read the whole story from, and I was just as disappointed that there wasn't any. A terrible waste of time, and one that I will not ever read again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to this.   This book is so boring, it has no substance whatsoever.  It makes me angry and sad.  This is so much boring.  So you think there is substance in this book, but it's just so bad and boring, i can't enjoy it at all.  I couldnt put this book down and the cover is great.  My only complaint would be that there was no conclusion.  What is the ending about?  I dont even know.  If it was a sequel, i would at least have had a conclusion because it wasnt good.   … more

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in 2015. This book was a complete waste of my time. I found it boring, repetitive, and had no emotional depth whatsoever. I would have no interest in re-reading this book or trying to learn anything about any of the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book.   It's really good and interesting.  The problem is, that most of the chapters are taken from other books.  Instead of creating a series of short stories,   the author decides to combine all of these parts into one book, but it's still too long.  I think that if you are an avid reader like me you will have a hard time understanding the author, because it's not that well written.  It could have been done better, but if you read some of the other reviews, you might think that there is something more important in this book than just a good story.  In the end, this book could have had more pages, but, there is a lot of good things in it and I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really not a fan of this book. It's too vague and not clear enough about the characters and their backgrounds, and the prose doesn't flow the way it could, it has a very flat feel to it. My husband's first book was similar, but he was more successful with the characters. I think this book just falls flat.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the book, and it wasn't bad.   The characters were likable and the story was good.  There were a couple of weak elements.  But in the end, I am disappointed that a book of this scope could not be created in more than a thousand pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I never had much desire for this book, but finally gave it a try because of my love of the books on Amazon. But the book is really bad, and is only half as good as the reviews seem to make it out to be. The author writes:  "As for how I feel about being an alien: I feel no shame, no guilt, not even a little embarrassment. I'm sure there are people out there with darker personalities that have been to our planet, and I know that we have a strong, complicated relationship with the other species in our solar system.  "I like being an exile. It's different than being a citizen of one of the other worlds. It feels like I'm really out of my own world, which is good, because I like my world too much." And then she goes on to write the same thing in a different book: "The alien is an exile, and she's lonely, she feels lost, and that's not all that bad. I want to be lost too." I was just disgusted with the book.   The author is saying the same stuff about being a human from another planet that she has been saying about being the child of a king. The other planet was not very nice, and the author seems to have made up some reasons for it.  As for the children of the king (the main character, the one who has a sister who goes away to another planet), I have never liked them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was extremely interested in this book at first. It sounds really cool! Unfortunately, the book does not live up to the hype. This book has little to no plot or characters and the only thing it does is go around making a bunch of promises it has no way of actually accomplishing. The author spends the whole book talking about some "thing" that won't happen (yet) and how it'll change everything but then does nothing to back that up. There is absolutely NO explanation about what any of this "thing." It's just a vague and half-baked idea, and I can see how people would be interested because that's exactly how a lot of science fiction is written. But this book is boring. I didn't like it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book made me want to quit reading. It starts off fine and I was intrigued by the concept. I thought it would be good as a stand alone book but as I kept reading it just became less interesting and interesting only got worse. I'm pretty sure the concept was good but the execution just did not hold up.  Review: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narrator is not good, the voice is very low and annoying, and some of the story elements are confusing.   When I read this book, the author gave me some information about a story, I thought the book would be great because it's in the horror genre, so I decided to read it.  I had a great time reading it, I liked it, but the characters were not interesting.  But there is a part of the book where I thought I would have liked to see more of the characters and I'm not sure the author knew how to show that.  I wish I had read this before I began taking notes and I think I would be more interested in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The characters in this book were flat and boring. The main character was very much one-dimensional in his motivations, as well as the way he treated the other two characters in the book. "   "This book is boring because all the characters are not likeable in their own way. The female characters were not even likable. I'm not looking for a romance at the beginning of a book. I wanted to see a lot more romance. The male characters were weak, stupid and had no depth to them at all. The protagonist, for example, did not seem to want to improve himself at all (and that's not something that's good in a book!). I am sure he would be a good person, but that didn't make him a good character."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The reason the novel is so bad, is that it starts off with a great premise. "All of us were born with something special. A thing called a soul, a spark of life, that makes us unique." The plot twists in this novel are too numerous to count, and it gets even weirder from there.   But the biggest thing that bothered me the most was the plot twist.  It's like if somebody told you a crazy idea that they thought was a good idea at the time. They came up with a novel where they use the idea as an actual plot device and twist it into a story where the crazy idea becomes the plot device, resulting in a horrible book.  That's like saying, "Hey, I thought we were all born with a spark... why don't we just do that with the spark that makes each of us special.  I don't think we'd enjoy it if we were given a spark, or any spark."  (hide spoiler)   I liked the concept behind the novel. The soul is the spark of humanity that allows us to connect with each other and to live, and the spark is an innate ability to reason, feel, and love. But as with all good stories about life (including this novel), the story's twist was a terrible idea. And if I was a writer and wanted to use this concept as a plot device (which I do), I would have to add in some more twists and turns.  (view spoiler) So if you ever want to read a good book that's both entertaining and funny, get The Soul is a Spark by Tom Robbins. It's the perfect book for summer reading, and can even be enjoyed by people who enjoy fantasy fiction. And the only thing that I don�t like is the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book, but the first half was frustrating for me because I kept forgetting to keep up with the plotline and, while there are a few clever parts, I just didn't find them entertaining enough. I would definitely recommend it to someone who enjoys a good mystery.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing good about the book is the title. This book is very dry, boring and very much like a story a bad writer would write. The author has a talent for making you feel sorry for some bad guy who gets a bad beating in some kind of game. The story is dull as a toad. There are no twists or surprises or anything that will make you jump out of your chair. It's a very predictable story and a very stupid book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What's the worst thing about this book?   The first 20%   sucks.   I read this on my Kindle and couldn't even start it, it was so slow, it just dragged on.  This book is so slow.  The second half is much better, and is the best part of the book, but only by a little.  Posted by Alex at 9:20 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself was okay. Nothing special or surprising for a young adult fantasy. The plot wasn't bad, but the character development for all the characters were bad. I don't think that any of them are developed enough or believable enough to be interesting. In some cases, the author does try to change the characters, but they don't really change. The main character is a stereotypical teenager but at the end of the day the author seems to want you to pity him for being the way he is. The other characters aren't developed well enough and their motivations and thoughts don't make sense. As for the ending, it's just plain weird. I think it would have been more effective if the character went to Hell to get her soul back but she just went back to Earth and forgot about the demons.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -I'm not sure how this book could have been better...and I'm quite surprised that it wasn't. It's a good introduction to a really complicated subject, but the whole thing can't be boiled down to one sentence: You should probably stop being so self-obsessed and realize that there is a difference between being good at what you love, and being good in general. (A quote from a book review)...but what I liked about this book was that it made me think about what I do when I'm not writing and try to figure out what my true calling is. I also liked the title: You can't love yourself and not love yourself. (another quote from the same book review...) I'm going to say this again, though: if you think you're really good at the things you love and the people you love are happy for you, you're probably not a happy person. And I'm a little sad to say that this book can be very frustrating in this area.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've always been the type of person who buys books I like and doesn't necessarily read them. I like what I like.   But this book caught me off guard and I don't know if I really liked it or not.  Well, I suppose you could say that the author has "spoiled" the whole book with the introduction and so on.  I think the book could have used a bit more "clarity" in the story.  I'm really glad it's "coming out" in paperback because I find it kind of hard to read online, especially when I'm trying to find the story for myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book, very readable and entertaining. But the author has to be a liar to get this right.  This book has a lot of good points and is well written. It's just that the author is either lying about how he became a writer or just not being honest about how much he likes writing.  The author is very good with the dialogue, but not in the manner one would expect. The book is full of lies, even about things the author didn't do. This would be a nice book if the author had not written a history book on writers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the first book I have ever read in which I completely disagree with the central thesis.   It's one of those books where everything seems to be missing.  What it seems to lack is character, and that is probably due to the fact that there is a lot of time devoted to explaining the very complicated world and religion of an alien race.  The book starts off by explaining the religion and culture of the Mecs, an alien species from another dimension. The story is set in the late 30's on Earth. At the time the Earth has been invaded by a group of aliens called the MECs. The MEC's have invaded our world for a variety of reasons including stealing our food supplies, and destroying some of our natural resources. However they are not the only alien race invading our planet.  There is also a group called the "Hedgehogs" from another planet who have been here for many years. One of the things the humans in our world have taken for granted is the ability to communicate with each other.  Unfortunately the MEGS have no such abilities.  To communicate, the METs use a form of telepathy called telepathy. To understand the MEEKs, they have to use the same sort of telepathic technology as the MECH's and HEPT's. The characters in the book are actually all MEG's, the HEPTs have been exiled and are now in the underground base, and the HETs are the MESHES. I have to say, the idea of the Hedgehogs (or MEC) being from another world is somewhat believable. I found that it was the people who seemed the least plausible, and whose motivations seemed most questionable. The main character was a human, and his family is one of the more interesting families. However, the story really started to go downhill when I found out his wife had a daughter and he and the daughter are only good friends. The other members of the family who were actually in the story (which was all the members of his family) were really only there to help out the human's. They were all so busy that the human character actually got caught up in the action and got killed.  I really didn't understand the purpose of his wife's actions, except to explain the human race to the humans, because I think the META's have enough problems without having the MEGA's, a race of beings from
Write a negative review about a bad book:        This is the most disreputable book I've ever read.   The language is offensive, and the writing is just bad.  I don't know if it's intentional, but it's extremely juvenile and juvenile stories don't belong in literature.  This has really nothing to do with the story though, and even if it did, I would still have no interest in reading a book about a girl trying to find love and how she falls in love with a horse.  It has nothing to add to the world of magic other than a horse and a lot of sexual innuendo.  You may think it's an entertaining read, but I don´t believe so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would like to give this book 4 stars and still recommend it. The book is extremely well written and the characters were engaging. However, if you don't have the ability to read, this is not for you. I gave a 3 star because some of the book's ideas were intriguing and interesting. The idea that if there is a chance at a good life that you can choose that good life is very good. That being said I do think that the book was a little confusing, it seemed as if the book had multiple characters. That can be a good or a bad thing in my opinion, it depends on the book. The writing was good though, the characters are real and the ideas were interesting. In conclusion, I would recommend this book to someone who is looking to improve their life. I have been living on the streets for over 8 years and this book was very enlightening, if not the best book I have read recently.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read other reviews of this book that say that "this book does not teach students how to solve problems or how to improve their knowledge of the subject."   Well, that is one way to put it.   Unfortunately, the problems I encountered are much more widespread and more troubling.  I will begin by stating that I am not in a college course and I am only an undergrad.  So, the information that is presented does not pertain to college level problems.  The textbook uses examples that were developed by a college professor with a degree in psychology, but he did not provide any reference to support the concepts that the examples are based on.  In addition, the examples that are given for a problem do not work well in any kind of scenario.  For example, the example of using a pencil to scratch the wall is a useless scenario because there is a wall.  However, in the chapter on math problems, there are various problems that use the same example of scratching a wall but use different examples in different situations.  And, at one point, the text talks about using a combination of "common sense" and logic in a problem, but then states, "there is no evidence that any common sense or logic is helpful in most situations."  To make matters worse, it does not say that there are other books that could be used instead of this one.  It is unclear if it should even be recommended as a textbook for undergraduates since it has some problems in it, but it does say, in a footnote: "I am not aware of a book specifically intended for undergraduate students."  I think that the problems with this book are too serious to even use it as a reference.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was young. I read it at the suggestion of my teacher who thought it would be a good idea to read a history book while on break from school. The book I got from the library was hard to understand. The narrative was interesting but too slow. I didn't like the narrator's voice (although I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing). I have no regrets about my decision to read this but I will not recommend it to my younger self.  24 of 29 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author, David C. Cook, has a way of describing the horrors of war but does not do any adequate research to support his claims. The book does not appear to be an impartial account of the war, but an attempt to bolster the case of the antiwar movement against the US military. Cook does not address the political aspects of the conflict, such as the role of the CIA in causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the role the US government played in overthrowing the democratically elected government in Iran in 1953. Nor does he examine the role played by the US in undermining the independence of Panama. He also does not delve into the military aspect of the Korean War, nor the role it played in the US's economic policies. The result is a well researched book about a subject that is not really discussed in depth, at least not without the author's intervention.  Review:  A little over five hundred years ago, the Romans laid waste to large areas of northern Europe. The people living there were called Gauls, which is now a dialect word for the English people. This was a civil war, not a civil disorder, as the Romans would call it. The invaders defeated a unified and highly organized resistance. The war was long, costly and ended in the Treaty of Campania, which was an extension of a previous treaty that was signed in 274 CE. The treaty brought peace to Italy. The end of the invasion was a disappointment, but this book is about it, not about the people who lived in the newly conquered lands. The authors, Daniel P. McLennan and James H. W. Jackson, use the treaty as their source. It is not a great book. They write in a way that implies they know something about the Romans but they don't really know much about Rome, much less about the Gauls. They don't seem to know much of anything about the Roman world. The Gauls are the equivalent of the Irish in the book, and the book is very much about the Irish, not the Gaul. The Romans seem to be caricatures of themselves, they have a culture as well as a language, but it seems that the authors just picked them because they were easy to write about.  I would have liked to know more about the Franks, the people of the north who were the victims of this war, especially the Franks and Germans, the authors of the treaty.  The book is not just about the
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book thinking I was buying a book on Buddhism, but I ended up with an anti-Buddhist rant about how much I hate Buddhism and have no problem with Christians being born-again.   My husband is a Christian, so I don't have anything against the Christian faith.  I'm not a Christian.  I've only ever seen one positive article on Buddhism on the internet.  For this book, I would recommend it to someone looking for something to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping this book would be a good read but it turns out that it's just a bad romance novel with the usual story that we have heard many times before.   This is like an extended version of a series that is currently being turned into a movie.  This is the kind of book you read if you're looking for a good romance novel.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A few chapters are good. But I'm having trouble believing that any book of this size could do so much less with less.   The writing is terrible; this book is hard to understand.  For a book that has been released in 2013 I expected something more.  I am glad I picked up this book, but I will be looking to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book but the ending made me want to rip the pages off my book case and eat my copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I'm not sure what went wrong but there's no way I'd ever read this book again. I'm just happy the author has a backup plan.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've just finished reading this book, and it doesn't seem worth it. I'm a huge fan of Hildegard's works, so I was looking forward to this book. I was not disappointed. It is a very different sort of book from anything Hildevard had done before, and the story takes a completely different approach. The characters are so well drawn, that you feel like you really know them. The book starts off with a couple of scenes set in Hildeburg, and ends with a battle between the local Norse (that's the people who live in the area), and the Danish army. The Vikings fight well, using every weapon available (or just throwing axes) to drive the Danish from their land. I think the Viking scenes are more of a draw to this than the battle scenes, as the battle is rather boring, but I can see where the writers would go with it. The whole story takes place in a couple weeks, and I couldn't imagine a more perfect time to read this book than this, and that's saying a lot. I am so glad I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise is interesting and compelling, but the rest is lame and unfun.   It would have been better if she were trying to write about something she actually had seen instead of using some stereotypes and clichés from TV and movies.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. I was intrigued by the premise and the overall plot. But the characters in this book were so annoying and did not develop, so the plot was a joke. There was no development in this main character and she felt more like a caricature. The other characters were not really worth following. There are not enough pages for the characters to develop and they all just act like the same two characters over and over again. One character had a romantic interest in a male character and the other is really just a side character who doesn't do much. This book just dragged and did nothing but make me want to turn the page, which I did, but it felt very cheap and didn't get me to read anything else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read all the books and can't say anything bad about them. But this book didn't get the same reaction from me as the others and that bothers me.   My review:  Well I have to say that this review is just a few words. The characters in this book are well written and developed. The world is well thought out, so that when it comes to the story the reader gets the feeling it's been around for a long time. It's interesting how it doesn't focus so much on the characters but instead how the various races interact, and how that affects the politics in the world. I will say that one of the characters in the book is a little annoying. I feel like the author was trying to explain why this person was so stubborn, and it seemed to me that there wasn't really any reason. It bothered me because I liked this person so much. I've also read this book on Goodreads and it's rated a 4/5.  I received this book free from the publisher through Netgalley's free program.  This one is on my list for sure. The cover of the book, which was done by a friend of mine (the name was given as  The Great War,) is very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I got this book for Christmas in 2013 and I was absolutely thrilled when I got it. I loved the idea of having this book as a companion to my other favorite character from the book.   For my first reading of the book I had a couple of problems with it. First, the story is too long. The first book was just 13,000 words, and the book for the second was 20,000. The story in the book itself was amazing, but the length of it bothered me. Second, I hated how a lot of times, the main character would try to kill his parents or siblings in the first book and that wouldn't be that great of a story. However, in this one the death of the main characters happened off-screen and that helped to make it a better book. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who liked the character from that book. "The Great War of the Roses" by George R.R. Martin
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read a number of these and can tell you that this is one of the most irritating books I have ever read.   "I was trying to get to a good place, but all I got was a bad place"   The main character, John, is a man that has to come to terms with the fact that he is an alcoholic.  He has been "drunk" his whole life and he was trying (and failing) to control it.  Unfortunately, there was a large group of people that he was drinking with that also happened to be alcoholics.  These people are the most annoying of all.  There is so much negative feedback for not being a "good guy" that it gets a little tiresome after awhile. The problem I had with this book is that it takes the "good guys" out of a story that would be much better without them and it just feels like it's missing some crucial part of the story.  If only John was a little less obnoxious and a little more supportive of his "friends" then this might have been a nice little read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . My husband bought this book after reading one of his "best of" lists and decided to pick it up. We enjoyed the read through, but the book is not as good as the one I read in high school. This was the first book in my teen read list so I had high hopes. But, the only problem I have with the book was the title. The book actually should be called "You're Not Doing It Right", it describes the wrong way to read and write. You start writing by making a list, not by writing a list first.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about an evil sorcerer who kidnaps little girls and keeps them chained to his bed all day long and then, after he's killed off, he throws his head and then his body into a river to be eaten by fish.    It's terrible.  It has no plot and is a waste of a book.  My favorite character is the little girl that is tortured by this man and she was the first one to write a review about this book on Goodreads and the other reviews that the author's have left were all really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry, but that is the WORST book I have ever read. It's a really long book (roughly 1500 pages) and this is the third book I've bought with that kind of size. This is the second book of this series that i haven't liked one bit. I'm hoping for more from this series. I read the first book in this series and loved it but this one is a complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is not a true historical account. It is a history of the Nazis and their ideology, not about the events in and around the concentration camp at Auschwitz or the Jews who were sent there.   If you wish to read about the Holocaust you can read about that in books about the Jews.  I have not found one author who can write about the Nazis with such verve, knowledge and depth, and I have read many of the previous works of historians, as well as the books of the survivors of Auschwitz. As a Jew and survivor I found it hard to put down this book.   of the Auschwitz survivors. The author has done a good job of giving a realistic picture of the concentration camps and the living conditions in the camps, and of the Jews there. I have never read anything like it. If you wish (as I did) to read something of an accurate description of the German experience in the occupied countries, you can find that in a book called 'In the Heart of the Reich' by Dr. Paul Bechtold. I am afraid that this book was not made for an English-speaking audience. There are not enough detailed descriptions of the camps and of what it was like to be there. The Nazis used the camps as a source for propaganda, and this book is an attempt to convey the horrors of life under the Nazi regime to non-Jews. The book is a good read for those interested in a more detailed and up-to-date account of the Nazi persecution of Jews, but it does not have the depth and verve of the works of those above. I would say that the book should be required reading for anyone who wishes to understand the Holocaust in all its complexity.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only positive I can say about this book is that I have already finished it and I am going to do so again this year! I really enjoyed the novel, the character development was great, and there was a lot to like about the plot (as long as you accept that the characters will act like assholes).   I think the writing style, as it was in the book, is a little hard to read when you're a first-time reader; it's kind of hard to follow along and not get lost in all the details. I would love to read the sequel to this book because it is so much better than the novel itself; the plot seems to have been better-written (the main characters and their conflicts are more developed) and the tone and action seem to be a little more engaging in the sequel (it is, of course, very much still the same story). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am really not a "newbie" to self help books, but it did not help my marriage at all.   "If she doesn't get a job or a promotion, or gets fired and makes lots of money at a company, she's going to get a divorce in no time. If the husband thinks he should have done more to protect his wife in her job, his wife's going make it even worse."   The wife is going to cheat. It's no wonder the husband's so worried about her. It seems obvious to me. I can see it now, but my husband is stuck in the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started to enjoy this series. It was a good story for children. However the beginning and ending were bad. I was frustrated about that. The story was about the adventures of a couple of girls in a school bus. There were some nice touches of humor but this series had a problem with humor for the most part. The ending of the series was bad as well.   I started to appreciate the story better and this is what I learned as I went along. I really do recommend this to any parents and teachers who have a few hundred dollars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a good read, but the ending made me feel sorry for the characters (though not for the author).   The book is full of weirdness and the weirdness makes the book worth reading.   (review of free book)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just another bad book from this writer.    He's a good writer, but his writing is terrible.  One of the problems I have with most books in this genre is the lack of real world stories.  They are all the same, a group of people are thrown into some bad situation, and the book makes no attempt to make any connections, or build any characters.  This book is the opposite, the author gives us an amazing world with a lot of history.  We get a whole town to learn about (at least in the first half), and a lot to see. The problem with the book though is that we don't get that much to do with it, and even if we did, the story would have just gotten more and more boring.  The only real conflict that arises in the book is when we learn the author's backstory.  I have to admit I like the backstory, but if we're going to use flashbacks to fill in gaps in history, that should be a more powerful moment in the story, not just a cool idea. The whole reason I picked this book up was to read something original and not have my favorite author just plagiarize other authors.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish this had been written by a man. If it was, I would have loved it. And you know what? It might have been even better if it had been.   The "experts" on the other side of the "debate" in this book are men. It makes a difference.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book on a flight from Miami to Washington DC, and at the time I thought it was about an ex-patriot who went to war in Iraq. I guess I was wrong, though this book isn't exactly a classic either. The book starts off pretty typical with the protagonist being a Marine from Ft. Jackson, GA who was in a relationship with an American woman until they split up. He then goes to Iraq and has a lot of fun fighting a war. Well, except for one thing: he can't drink alcohol. That is a major issue in the book: what he does is fine and does get him a lot more money than he could get at home, but if he has to drink alcohol he's never going to make enough money to support himself. If he had gotten over that problem he could have been a better man. There are some very interesting ideas presented in this book and it's interesting to see some of the military bases that the author visited and what was going on there, but I still have to question the author's ability to write about things in a positive light.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst novels I've ever read.   I love all my books, but this was a horrible book that ruined my enjoyment of all my favorite books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not all bad. I'm not sure why, but something about the prose doesn't feel quite right to me. It reminds me of how some of the early, uninspired books of Hemingway and Faulkner have come to seem.       The story is very well told and paced, though there are definitely parts of it I wish were expanded upon.  It's got a pretty strong "weird" twist at the end, but I doubt many readers will get there.  I was a bit puzzled by some of my favourite parts. For example, the characters' attitudes toward the environment.      They go about their business and the characters we know (the scientist and the professor) have their own reasons for why they're doing what they're trying to do.  In the end (which isn't entirely unexpected, considering the twist), the "villain" (I think he was a girl), reveals his identity.  But to me, that just seemed a bit rushed and rushed.  That's just not good enough for a book that starts out so promising.  As mentioned, though, there are lots of laughs.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is a mix between what you expect from a science fiction novel and what you get from a modern romance. The characters are complex and the plot develops slowly but with a real sense of dread, leaving you feeling like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop.    "A life can be a bad one at the beginning. It can seem so. A time, a place, a situation can make a man's life a misery. But as the years pass and as time passes, it may just seem like a long time, and life, all things being equal, will end up being better than it seemed to be at the start."       "Time is a flat circle that never goes around back to its starting point. You cannot go forward. Time moves forward, time moves backward, time marches forward again."  At times, the story may be too heavy handed with symbolism. At other times, I felt the story could have benefited from some more subtlety.    I did not think it was a very original story but it was very enjoyable reading and was definitely recommended.  I recommend this book to:  Those who like sci-fi/fantasy/romance and those who like to read a modern romantic book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a typical YA (young adult) horror story. The characters are likable (I did like the teen character, but the author didn't get his point across), the setting is interesting and different from our world (it's very much like a Victorian England), and the story is well-done. However, the plot doesn't work, and the writing isn't bad, but it just comes off as contrived, and not very interesting.   "We were in a dark alley in a remote part of town. I was in the middle of a conversation, which I can't remember the title of. I put down the book, walked over to my friend, and told him what I was doing, but I couldn't remember if I was talking about him or the book. It was like having a conversation with a memory. He shook his head, put the book down, and walked off to talk to someone else.  I'm afraid my friends will hate me for what I've done.  "   "I don't think it's a novel.  I think it was a series of short stories, each one set in a different location."     "So, he and I were in the car, driving back from the movie. He looked a little nervous because I kept talking about some other subject that I knew was probably a waste of time, so I just left it at that."  And some of the people in the book aren't very likable, but hey...   A few years ago, I got my own copy of this book on a sale at a bookstore.  The premise of the book is interesting: a teenage girl named Amanda falls in love with a guy, and it seems like a good idea for her to go to a school where he's from. Unfortunately, the school is a horror school, and Amanda falls victim to the horror that is the school: vampires. There's a whole book on the vampire school.  In order to prevent Amanda's death, her best friend, Emily, must seduce the vampire hunter who's been after her for years.  Unfortunately, her character is a huge piece of crap, and that's why I don't like her. Amanda's best friend Emily isn't all that likable either.  There's something about her that just makes her a dull heroine.  It was a shame to have to wait so long to read this book
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I'm writing this review after not getting this book for a week. I was super excited to get a new book by DFW, I have read DFW for the first time and loved it, so I had high hopes that this book would be a worthy successor. Well it wasn't. I'm not going to sugar coat it, this book is not very good. It's a book about what the author calls the "postmodern condition," which is a fancy way of saying modernism is a terrible idea. That's about all the book has going for it, it is a very poor example of modernism. It uses a lot of outdated and cliché ideas like the idea of "post-modernism" which isn't really a term and is really just a modernist idea to try to make modernism sound cool. I wish I could say it is well written, but it is really bad and it is written really badly. It would have been better if the book was written by a new author and had better ideas, because the concepts that are explained are quite stupid. It is a shame, because it could have been a really good book. I think DFW just had an idea about modernism that he didn't like, but when it comes to modernism, I hate everything modernism ever stood for. I hate modernism in the sense that I think that it is pointless, and that is a really bad thing to say about modernist ideas. DFW's argument is the same as the argument against modernism when it was first made, that there are some ideas that are more important than others, and one of those ideas is "modernism." In fact, the entire book was designed to prove the idea that "modernity" is better than anything that has come before, but DFW is so out of touch with the ideas that make up modernity that he doesn't even seem to realize that this isn't true. And of course he is not actually writing a criticism of modernity, because he isn't trying to critique modernism at all. There is something about the postmodern condition that is appealing to him because it is similar to his ideas about modernity. But even then his book doesn't do what he wants it to do, it doesn't criticize the modernism he loves, but instead it defends the post-modern condition, which is not a good thing. The only idea that is worth defending is the idea about what modernity
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book as much as others. The author, James Patterson, made the best of a bad situation. It's a book about a guy who's looking for a way to have a normal relationship with his girlfriend. After finding a guy, his family and friends try to help him find a real one. Patterson tries to make it as relatable as possible but I wasn't too impressed. There were times when I felt the character was a little bit over exaggerated and that the situation in the book was not realistic. I do understand that Patterson had a hard time writing this book but I found it boring and I think it needs to be read more often.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really love this book, but as you can tell, there were some very minor things that made me feel slightly disappointed. The main problem was that I was really looking forward to having a female character with some agency of her own (especially since I've never seen a character in any other book that did such a thing) but that didn't happen. I'm looking forward for a sequel (which I plan to read before the first one is finished) so that I can give this a try again. In the meantime, this book has me hooked for sure.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were some things in this book that really ticked me off about religion that I didn't really like at all.   I know a lot of people say they're trying to be less religious, but I was just completely turned off by some of the things they were saying and did not feel like they were being true to themselves.  I'll give them this, though:  One of the points in the book that is the most compelling is the idea that one of the worst things you can do is to believe in a god who's just going to torture and kill you over and over. That's really harsh, but the idea of believing in a God that's going to let you die over and again and give you nothing in return is actually worse.  As I said, my biggest problem is with how people talk about faith in the modern age, but that's just me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    (Read the whole review)  I found this book to be very confusing and contradictory.  I can't say for certain why a book written in the seventeenth century called "The Art of Cooking" was written in eighteenth century English.   The best I can tell is that the author had a pretty good imagination and that he used a few techniques he thought were pretty new, however he didn't seem to know or follow his own instructions in many cases.  My own opinion is that he failed to understand the modern methods for making sauces.  However, his approach to cooking is quite simple - to "use the best ingredients available at the time."  There's no mention of the importance of "cooking for health."   He uses the word "seasoning" on every page.  It seems like a good idea, but that word seems to mean something different in modern times.  If this book had been written in 1815, it would have read "season with a pinch of salt, a couple of bay leaves, pepper, cayenne, and a little sage, and add to it a good quantity of vinegar or other flavoring."  The book is quite good for a beginner.  (Read the entire review)

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I felt like I was reading a horror novel by a man who wasn't afraid to say things like, "you just need to work out more."     He doesn't give any hints as to what kind of monster you should be afraid of.   He doesn´t explain why the monsters are killing us, how they can do this, what kind the blood they drink, or if they are able to survive if killed by our weapons.  I was expecting something like "it is a dark world with terrible monsters"   "but why can´t we fight back against it?"   The only thing I learned from this is that there is a lot of "it´s not our fault" stuff in the book.  My rating:  5/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to read this book because, although I'm not a fan of children's books, this sounded interesting.   The book's premise sounds very appealing to a 10 year old: "A boy and a girl meet on a train and fall in love."  The problem is, this girl is not the girl I imagined when I read this story.  In fact, I'm almost certain that the person writing the book is writing it for a much older male audience.  The main character has no personality beyond the fact that he wants to get married to a girl he is really in love with and has a "silly plan" for making her do it.  And the boy?  He is "a very nice young man."  Unfortunately, the romance is only partially resolved by the end of the book.  Instead, the main plot of the story is centered on two children who are trying to make a difference in the world.  Unfortunately for both children, their "plans" only make things worse.  This book is just a little over two years old so I have little faith that it will retain the good feelings for this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "If it were up to me, this is the title of the book. As a kid, I read all the Mephisto novels by Richard Matheson. I think they're all pretty good. This one is not. If it were me, I would have changed the ending to the Mule's death. And he was pretty pathetic at it! The writing style is weird and the characters are... well, I don't know how to say it. It's really, really not very interesting." -Liz from Texas " I wanted to like this book, but I don 't really see any connection between this guy and the Mules. Maybe this is some sort of alternate history? Maybe there really was an original Mule, but when he was sent off to be killed he was forced to become the new Mule? Not sure, but it is still kind of silly. " -Amber from Illinois
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed by this book. The story was enjoyable but I found myself bored. The characters were bland. The plot did not interest me and I feel like I was reading a rehash of something from the last 200 years or so.   Overall:  I'm going to say the story is interesting enough for me to keep reading but the characters and plot make the book just forgettable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was too boring. The world-building is not well-written, the characters were boring, and the story is nothing more than a bunch of battles. The best characters are boring.  Readers who liked: I know, it's a little hard to believe. It has a bit of good ideas, but it's just a buncha battles. And why did it take so long for the empire to come in? I had a hard time getting my head around the "giant" concept, and at the very least it might have made the battles more interesting. But this book is just a lot of battles (well, some battles are a lot more interesting than others.)  Innovation:  I know what you're thinking... "Oh, so this book takes place in an Empire with a Giant Army and the whole thing is set on a planet called a Giant Planet," huh? Well, yeah. Yes. Yes, that is the exact thing it does. The problem is that I find myself waiting for some real action in the story. I expect a book to focus on a protagonist, but that just wasn't the case here. Instead the characters just do this, that and the other, and nothing ever happens. The writing was also pretty...boring. Not a problem when I am reading a good book, but I did want to read something that took a slightly different angle on the story genre, or at least the "World-building" aspect of it. I would definitely read more of these kinds of books, but this one did not make me want to get more excited about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as I'm trying to pick up a non-fiction book for my classes, but ended up going back and reading it for the story. The story isn't the strongest part of this book, but the writing is quite good.   This book had me a little lost for a while; I've heard so many good stories about "The Great Depression", and I knew what to expect from a book by historian John Perkins.  It's good to see a good book by someone other than Richard White and Howard Zinn, but it does feel like a bit of a cop out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. I liked it a lot but the way it was told to me in a boring fashion just made it uninteresting to me. I would have had a lot more fun reading a different book but this one was way over my head.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The badness of this book is well-established: there's a poor translation, the plot is a mess, and the plot itself is a lot like the first three books of the series.  The good:  In fact, it's a lot better than the first book.  As mentioned above, this series is very well-written, and much better than most fantasy books.  One of the novel's highlights is that it isn't a generic "evil wizard/evil wizard with magic" novel.  And unlike in the previous book, this book doesn't have a bad ending.  I also enjoyed the way the plot progresses.   This book was very good, but the second book was just as good and more interesting. I can't wait to see what happens next.  (Read full review)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *This book is very bad, *I have just read a few of the books   The story is about a person who wants to be famous and is told about his life with a lot of lies, but the best parts are the characters. I like the main characters, I wish they were more developed, but I will give them credit for trying.  * The characters and the stories they are told from are very interesting, and the plot is good.   I really don't understand how anyone could read this and not want to read it.  This book was bad; I don't know why I bother reading it. I got sick of the main character after about page four, I'm a pretty bad reader (don't care how well I do, it's a bad game, you can't win), but I got stuck in this book. I really liked the main bad guy. The first thing that happened to me was I was shocked when I started reading the novel. It took me almost two minutes to figure out who it was that I thought was so evil and bad. I then thought for a moment about what the evil person in this novel was like and I realized the character was a really good villain. I don"t know what kind of mental gymnastics the author used to make the characters in this story sound so evil, but it was working, it was really good. There were things that I liked, but other things that were hard to get through.  I would have read the whole novel if I could have.  It is really hard to figure how the person can be so evil that I didn't want to like him.  For those of you who want to be more famous than the person who is evil, this is a great novel, but you need to keep in mind that the main villain wants to take over the world, so there is that.  Overall, this book is really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucks.   I hated it.  You know what is wrong with this book? First of all, it's written by an English professor. In other words, he is so out of touch that he can't write a novel that is a masterpiece, like J.K. Rowling. Second, the story is boring. The setting is boring, the characters are boring, and the plot is boring (a retelling of a fairy tale). I found that all boring and uninteresting. I was sick of the characters, and I am not going to enjoy a retelling.  Another thing that I don't understand is that Rowling never got her book published in English. I'm not sure if this book was rejected because of its genre or not. If this book had been published in another language, I believe it would have been a great success.  If you are looking for a fun read, go to the library and read a good book. You will like it and it will keep you entertained for a long time. If you find this book enjoyable, then go read Rowling's books. If, however, this book doesn't interest you, then I can only recommend this book to adults only. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I came to this book, I was expecting something different. This wasn't the case. This is a book that reads as if the author sat down to write a classic novel. I mean, the first line reads: The year was 2007. It's a bleak time. I'm the only one in my family who doesn't know anything about guns. As a result, my gun collection consists of what I'm given. There is a shotgun I've had for over twenty years, a pistol I picked up at an antique shop in town (a great gift for my mom who can't afford a gun), and an antique revolver. I've also had three or four rifles in the last few years. But I have no plans to start the hunt for the long gun I always wanted. I have a little gun collection of my own. I keep a.45 in my bedroom and a.22 in my garage. I like the look and feel of the guns I own. It makes me feel like a man, even though I only own a couple. I carry a.357, a.380, a few 9mm's and a couple.38's. There's a little more I'd like to try with the.357. And I like to shoot a little at the range, but I think I've gotten good enough with the 9mm that I'm ready to put the.380 away.   I was really looking forward to this one. There were so many things that annoyed me about the previous books that I really, really wanted this one to be good. This book is just the opposite. The writing is not a lot better than what we've been treated to, but it's just as bad in what it isn't. There are no real characters, only a lot of things that make you believe you're in someone else's head. The narrator is a terrible character. She's just there to tell a story and that's it. In fact, you'll probably not know who the narrator is for a good while because she's such a bland character. I liked her for a few pages but that was all. The story itself isn't bad. It just has the wrong amount of plot. It really doesn't have any. I don't know why it had a title that wasn't even an abbreviation for something or something not bad. I got the impression the authors were thinking this was going to be a good book when they wanted it to be

Write a negative review about a bad book:    this book is a total failure.   I have been reading this book for years, and the reviews always say something positive.  Now, I don't mind a lot of the bad reviews.  But the bad review that says it's boring and lacks any action.  That's not true at all.  This book is full of action. The action is so bad I nearly stopped reading the book, but then I just went back and re-read the book over and over.  The book has some really good action. It's just all so dull and mundane.  My favorite action is when the boy and girl get kidnapped by the kidnappers.  It's so well done.   When the kidnapper has to go back and tell his son where his parents are, it makes me want to be a dad for one more second.  I love when I'm reading a book and I remember my childhood.  Now, I may never have those memories because this book doesn't have them.  In a way, it reminds me of a story from my old home:  The boy and I were walking home.  We were talking about my mom, and I asked him why his mom always said I was ugly.  And then he said something that made me cry.  "She doesn't think I'm pretty, but I'm still the prettiest of the lot of you."   I think that's a great line, especially the first time he says it.  Even though I've read this book several times, I still want to cry. The book is about the father's search for his missing son.  He is a good man.    But his son is gone.   He doesn't know what to do.  His only thought is to search for him.   This father has never had a problem finding his son. It is his wife who's problem is that she has lost his son, and she blames him for his disappearance.   The book starts out with the father searching for his son in a huge forest, where he finds the boy, and he gives him a necklace that reminds him of his son's love for him, but he cannot find his son and he has to leave. The father doesn't get a chance to do anything with the boy because he is attacked and killed by the local bandits.  Then the father takes the boy back home.    The father searches for his lost son,
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The cover:   The book is beautiful.  It says on the back "an epic love story between a boy and a girl."  The story:     The story is about a young boy named Harry Potter. His parents were not what most parents are. They were a bit odd. His father loved animals and lived a really nice life. His mother loved Harry but also was somewhat of a nut. She would come home and tell Harry how she was bored with her life and she was just going to go back to school. Her parents weren't really good with their money. They lived a very comfortable life but Harry just wanted something better for his parents. He decided to make his own way in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a huge fan of The Dark Thorn by L. E. Modesitt, but unfortunately this book didn't do it for me. I am very disappointed with this book. The Dark, Thorn and the Red was an entertaining fantasy story, but this book isn't. The plot is not very complex, as most of the characters are fairly similar. They don't have very much to do in the book. All the main characters are male, except for the female protagonist who has a small role in the story. The story was interesting, however, as it was about how a group of girls can overcome the disadvantages of being witches. The book was enjoyable, but I think it could have been better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm an atheist and the book made me think of the god of the bible. It makes you believe that he would like to take a good man and make him a bad one. This book is a fraud. There is no god in there and if god is out there, he's hiding in some dark closet. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've only read this book once, and I'm still in awe.   If you have the slightest interest in the genre or history of science fiction, or the history of magic, or even just fantasy, you owe it to yourself to read this.  It will change your life forever!  It's one of those "what was I thinking" moments, and it's very well written!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am sorry to say, that this book is a horrible piece of writing. I was looking forward to reading it because I was impressed with the cover, but this book did not live up to the hype.   In my opinion, the writing style is very dull and I'm not sure if I have seen such a bland, flat style used before. For example, the main character describes the city she is living in as an 'urban fantasy' (I'm pretty sure this is not the type of thing an urban fantasy is). As I've said, the cover was impressive. I'm pretty certain it's the author's first time trying to make a cover and this was definitely a flop.   It seems to be a typical author's style. I understand that she has no artistic talent whatsoever. I am glad that this author tried to do something different from the usual authors, but I would not recommend this book at all, because the writing quality was just too dull. I can imagine that this will make it into a B fantasy. I think it's definitely too bad that they didn't make a better attempt at writing a novel. It was like trying to draw pictures with an a crayon instead of a paint brush.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for the first time on a whim, and, for some reason, it got stuck on my shelf in the back of my Nook. The first ten pages were okay, but the rest was boring, and the narrator's voice got on my nerves.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not as bad as you think.    This is very much a 'book about war', but it is not a 'war book'.   The author is clearly a war writer, with a heavy focus on the history and nature of warfare and warfare on the high seas and elsewhere.  While not a book with any'moral' elements, he does make a fair point in the context of a very real world situation, and I found the book quite informative and entertaining (I am always a fan of history for the 'narrative' alone).   But, as a whole, a rather boring, at times overly self-contained and overly convoluted, and very little of the novel's impact was felt after reading.  The world building is also very poor; the story is largely told through the perspective of the British and their own perspective.  I had also expected more from the author than the story would give me, so I will leave this review a half star.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I've read some good books, but this one just doesn't work. I think I'm starting to have a bad case of writer's block... The bad part is, the bad part was written. The good part was the story (if that counts), and the characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was okay - I like the idea and the prose, but it's really hard to read when it doesn't make sense.     The protagonist was too weak.  He's trying to get through the world, but the way he goes about it is just completely unrealistic and unrealistic. He makes a promise to one of his friends that he's not going to try to find another guy at the university, and when he finds a guy he's too scared to tell, he's so taken with him.  It's okay to be with the guy, but I wish it wasn't just as an excuse to make the story better.  Rating: 3.0 Stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the price. I don't think the author is an "artist". He's an author who has no interest in the art at all and just likes to push the author's own agenda. And he gets a lot of support from other people.   The last 10-15 pages are just a series of pictures.  The characters are all caricatures and I never get a sense that anyone has any real emotional connection with them. I feel like the authors are just trying to push their own agenda and not pay attention to the actual story they are trying to tell. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I wish there was a way to put down a book without making me feel like a moron! The best book I have read in years - the most profound! What could have been an unbalanced book became an insightful work on what it means to be human - and a great read for everyone! - The author did an excellent job of making us feel the emotion and the love in each chapter - and for me the most important lesson was understanding our mortality. - This book was beautiful, moving and so beautifully written! - I would highly recommend this book!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book. However, it is flawed in many ways, including in the way it's written. I would rate it higher in my head, but the flaws made it hard to read.   I really enjoyed this book, and it's flaws are a few, but overall a good book for an enjoyable read. I am now going to go find a copy.  The story is great. A young girl goes on the run after a murder but ends up in a creepy cabin that seems to be haunted. The author uses flashbacks a lot and I feel like this is how the book was meant to be.  The book does have some issues. I feel the author didn't have enough experience with her characters and the way she writes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending was not interesting at all... but the last 5 hours or so of the book was great. I'm always a sucker for a mystery that I can't stop thinking about. The way I found out was that the killer was in my school last year...I was so impressed, I actually checked out his blog and read all the blog posts. The book was well written and interesting but it did not have a good ending. I really want to read more from this author but I will have to wait to see if she starts writing for a living.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "My main issue is with the premise. In this story we're introduced to the two main characters; Alex and her boyfriend, who has a history with the other one. Both characters have one thing in common: they're bad parents. I mean the father, at least. He's such a terrible parent. Not just for his children, but for his own life. When the children's lives become a nightmare of drugs and neglect, the father is an afterthought. "He never does anything for his kids and spends all his time on drugs. "I wish I'd been born in another decade, as it is all so painfully predictable. This book is so far ahead of its time."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read about the many problems with this book and I will make one thing clear: If you're looking for something like the "Tales of Beowulf" (a book whose very nature is to be read in part, as a series of chapters), you are going to be disappointed.   The "tales" are often boring, repetitive, and poorly constructed, not the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a fantasy.  The main characters are one-note, while the plot is a series, with a protagonist that is only a distraction from the story itself.  Even the book's introduction is pretty bad, especially if you're expecting a "happily ever after".  This is not a book that I would recommend to someone who is just trying to find a good adventure story.  Recommended for the fantasy fan who wants a fast-paced, well-told story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The worst book I have ever read. I had bought the book on impulse because I heard good things about it but the actual book was dreadful and very boring. I can't think of a single reason to read another book by Mr. Fenn.       He was extremely pretentious in the way he presented his opinions and opinions about the characters of the book and the stories. It was really just a rehash of the author's previous books with only the changes being to his opinions of the characters and the plots." I just felt like I read a book that was completely written by a writer who didn't understand what he was doing, had a lot of time on his hands, and was in a constant state of writing about other peoples' work. It wasn't written in an interesting way or in a logical way. I felt like he had never read the books he was talking about in the past. This isn't to say that I have never been a fan of Mr.Fenn's books. They are actually some of my favorites. However, there are some books that are just awful, and this book is certainly one of them. This book was an absolute disappointment. There are no good or bad things about this book. I would recommend this book to people who want a quick read, but don't want to read a bad one.

If you have seen any reality tv shows, you would know that no one cares about anything they do. They talk about it and make up for it with some good acting and drama. This book was just a list of talking heads, and I didn't even care for some of the characters.   There are a lot of boring facts in this book that are not explained until the last page.  The only reason I was able to finish it was because I felt like the book was giving a bad review about myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a really hard time getting into the novel. The first third is wonderful, with great characters and a good plot. But then things get complicated...   It feels like the characters are at least partially a creation of the author (not necessarily in a good way) and the world is just a "set up" for something to come later in the book.   While there are some fantastic elements in the beginning, it is all put on hold for the next chapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason to read this book is to enjoy that horrible ending.   I hate reading bad stories.  The characters were annoying and the plot was weak.  When did they decide to make a character have an affair with a child?    The whole ending made me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book and I really liked it. It was very short. I would suggest giving it a shot, but make sure you don't overdo it. (This book was my first ever). However, there are some mistakes, especially in the character development, that keep the story from being very good.   Pros:  • The writing is very strong. I like the story very much.    The author is a good writer, I like his style.  I liked the story and it was good. I think there are too many flaws, but overall, I really like it.     I really wanted to like the character. He was interesting.      It was interesting to read a horror/steampunk story, but I didn't like all the things that were wrong with it, especially the character's weaknesses.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was fun for about ten minutes. Then it became a chore to read, and I found myself falling asleep about halfway through because my mind became overloaded with the plot.   It was supposed to be a psychological horror story about a woman who is possessed by demons, but the demon-possessed characters were boring.  The author said that she'd add more suspense and mystery, but so far, I'm not seeing that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad.   It's a bunch of little stories, the last few chapters are poorly written and the author gets into some weird philosophical things, that it doesn't seem like she has a clue how to write well.  For example, the first paragraph: The whole world was in danger. The entire world. All life, not just humans but all species and everything. Life on earth was in peril. It was all on the brink of extinction. A massive solar storm was coming. Not just the Earth, but all the suns in the Milky Way were threatened. The universe was coming apart, the stars were melting. It wasn't just a "threat" to the Earth. The whole universe was on the edge of a "catastrophic cosmic collapse".   This is what I mean by a "stupid plot". It's like a bunch stupid stories were put together to make a point. Then the author tried to make up for it by writing two extra scenes. The second one was a bunch more "bad guys" are coming to kill the humans, the second one also had a weird philosophical question: What is life?   There's a bit more about what this whole galaxy is like, it looks pretty bad, but that's to be expected.  This was an attempt to make the whole universe interesting to read about, but instead it got boring and stupid.  It would be fun to read a book like this in a couple of weeks, but it has already been read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a very well-written book. It's about the two years I lived in a house with the kids, when the kids were very young. My children have no memory of the house. It was a nice place. And there were great memories for the kids. But my husband had no memory. It just goes to show how the brain works. For many years I thought my husband did not remember either. But when I showed him the photographs, he said he could easily recognize his old bedroom. He also was able to see the photos of his kids who were young when he was in the hospital.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is very slow-paced and dull. The characters aren't very developed, which is to be expected with a short story. I can't see this book being popular among young girls.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really hoping this book would give me a little insight as to how she did her first book.   This is a book about a family who lived in a house that was haunted. I've read many books by people who have done the whole "Ghosts" thing and this is the least interesting.  The family has all the makings of a classic American family.  They have their own home they're pretty well off and are in a good place with no problems.  It's like any other story you've read and it's done well.  Unfortunately the book is a lot more like other books about ghosts and supernatural things than anything else.  I wasn't really digging the story at all.  She does have a lot of fun with the characters and I liked that.  However the book wasn't good, and I hope she tries to do something different in her next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was terrible. I was completely disapointed in the execution of the story. The author's goal was to make the reader feel that he has been there and done that - when in fact, he has not. I mean, the book is about a man's journey to become a better person by writing a book about himself. And yet, somehow it feels like he didn't even try. How in the world did he end up with such an unbelievable plot? It makes no sense. The only person in this book I don't understand is the character, and that's because he's just a character with the words of a writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The novel is a classic, but a typical good novel is more than this one. It's more like a classic horror novel in which something terrifying happens and the hero is trapped and has to get out. In this book the hero has the hero's dilemma in the form of a man in the town of Alton, Illinois. He is the only adult left in his village. He owns the local tavern and is a well respected member of his community. He just doesn't know how to deal with a young woman named Sara who has a dark secret she must keep hidden. He has to convince her that she is not a good person to be alone with and to tell her everything about herself. The narrator describes her from a child's perspective and is more descriptive than descriptive about the story itself.   One other point is that the narrator is the stereotypical stereotypical male, but the author portrays her as the stereotypical female. The main problem I have with the narrator's portrayal is that her writing style is very monotone and lifeless. This is particularly noticeable because her first name is always in the same sentence and she doesn't use the "l" sound in many of her sentences and it sounds awkward. This monotony is more noticeable because of the fact that the protagonist, Sara, is the first adult woman the man has ever met. The first adult male he's ever met is his son. I believe that it's the reason that the writer has the main character be female because it would be a lot easier to sell the book with a male protagonist. The way the author writes it the male protagonist is the good guy who has to come to the girl's aid and she is the bad guy who is a bad person to live alone with. I have trouble believing that the man was in a position to help her and that she just came to him to find a husband. I also find it hard to believe that she's the only woman in the whole town he knows. It makes the story seem a little too forced and unrealistic. Also, I found it very hard to read her descriptions and I didn't get a feel for who the girl was.   (hide spoiler)   [I was annoyed that the male characters in this book were always very immature. I liked that the author made sure the boy was older and that the boy's relationship with the girl wasn't just the son or the daughter's relationship. The daughter was the only real girl in the book and the son is
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed by this book. The book itself was ok. I liked the book overall though. The characters were enjoyable. However the story itself was not.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was boring, boring, and then it got even worse.   I bought the book to get information on what the 'experts' are saying and to get my opinion of it so I can write about it.  It didn't give me that at all.  I felt that it was trying to make some sort of point which I was not interested in hearing.  Instead I got some "gut feeling" so what the hell.    So what the heck is going on here?  It seems to me that this is about what you are thinking instead of being told what to think.  If I were a book reviewer, it would be a 4 out of 5 star book.   This is not.  It is a bad review.  1 out of 4 stars:  I gave this book a 2.5 star rating and it was a total let down.  This is a good, if not great, book but it really is not very interesting.  The author is very smart and it comes through in this book.  However the author seems to be making a point with little explanation and the author's conclusions are not explained very well.  Overall, I gave it a 2 star rating as I did not think the book was worth my time and money, but if you are looking for a good book I think this is a very good book and worth a look.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I read this book, I thought it was just a very well-written memoir of growing up in a Christian household, but the more I re-read it, the more it seemed to have more to do with a series of religious beliefs, or a Christian interpretation of the Bible.   I'm not sure how much this is intentional or not, but it kind of felt that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's a lot of talk about "women's studies" in the college environment in my community. I don't think any of that is good, and it's not really about women either.   The idea of the "woman's consciousness" that the text talks about (it's really just about a female student) is a little misleading.  I would have expected it to be about an older student who felt ignored, alienated, or misunderstood. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is about a young girl who is on a cruise ship with her parents. She's having an awful time with her father and they are both having sex with each other. She runs away on the ship and finds herself in the middle of a battle between two men for control of her body.   She was kind of bored with the book, I didn't think she got her needs met in the first part of the book so I gave the second half a fair chance.  I would have liked to have seen more of her character development, but that was more due to me being an older teenager than the author's writing.  The last two times I read this book it's been years since I have read any, so I have a lot of time on my hands and it has been nice to be reminded of what really happened back in the late 90's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has lots of errors, it is hard to understand and the author's prose is too bad to read.   My only complaint is the lack of an ending. This book was really long and so there was only a small amount of information which was very confusing to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is great, but it was written for someone who is not an expert. My main criticism is that in many of the examples it's clear that someone else worked on the math or the explanation.   Also, it's possible that some people just need a little more "help" on things like how to go from a point to another.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband read this book and then said, "I know you got it wrong" and started to point out every minor mistake. It just wasn't a good read, and his point wasn't completely fair (he did say it didn't feel very realistic).   Also, the main character's name is "Evelyn" not "Evelina" like in the book (which would make more sense). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book. I was expecting more from the author. I have read lots of works of science fiction and fantasy and was looking forward to seeing what she could do with this one. Her books tend to be very descriptive. I expected the author to write about a ship going from A to B and then back from B to A but instead I got an account of the crew getting drunk and acting like total assholes. She also goes on a rant about how much she loves this ship and how much they are going to miss it once it goes away. I guess there is a reason this book was not published more widely and so far I haven't seen it. My only criticism is that the ending was a little lame but then again I'm so used to crappy sci-fi ending stories that I don't really give a flying fuck.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just about getting the truth from the people. It is very important that one is well read and well prepared so one can make up his/her own mind on a matter and not be manipulated by biased sources. I was not in the least impressed with this book, and I doubt that I will ever purchase another book from an author who thinks like this. I found the book to be poorly written, and the author has lost his marbles. A well-written book should be clear, concise, accurate, and well-researched. Not so here. This book was nothing but a series of unsupported allegations of people who do not have credibility to begin with. I am a professional researcher and my understanding of DNA is well known. Not only did the author have the facts wrong, he also had the facts completely wrong, or so it seemed. It was as though he did not want to take the time to research the subject and the details, and he just did not care enough to bother. Not a good first effort on the author's part.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A pretty good book about the Vietnam War, but I felt the author (who was on a mission to document the war) fell into a lot of self indulgent, romanticized thinking about the war (it's a pretty good read, but not a good war story) and about the Viet Cong (it was a pretty bad book about those people, but it's a good book that has been written). I found it to be more interested in the politics of the war than in the actual action of the conflict.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a student, I find this book hard to use and to understand. One problem is that it is written in a style that I find hard to follow. It's a long book, and if I want to get an overview of it, I have to do the book from the beginning. So that I can start to use this new technique of thinking about things in ways that I haven't done before I have lost some of my previous insight and some of the concepts I learned from the old technique. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very skeptical about this book, especially after I read the blurb and reviews.   It has been a while since I read a book from my college days.  I am always a sucker for anything about the US Civil War period and particularly a book about the women in the war, especially the black women.  The history books that I have read about the Civil War and World War II that I read, I found them to be somewhat weak and one dimensional, I thought this one would be different.  But it wasn't.  As for the writing, I didn't really like it at all, I don't care for a lot of contemporary writing, not really, and I thought that was what I expected out of a book that is set in the Civil war, period.  If you are looking for a historical account of this period, then I guess this book is for you, but if you want a good book about a period of American history, the war will be better.  Overall:  I didn�t read much of the reviews, but the one that got to me was the one from the librarian at my local library that had this to say about the book, she said:  "The history of women in wartime is often described as �bad� and �bland�--too many �bad,� too few �blands�. But, if I�m going to be honest, it�s really hard for me to find a better book on women in this period than�I, Virginia.�   So it is good that the author has decided to give us a good overview of the women of the war era. I recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a bit of a slog. The characters are not particularly interesting. I can see why they are heroes. However, if you are trying to come to terms with their problems and you can't bring yourself to care about their problems, that is a major problem. If you're a superhero fan, it's like you read a story and your characters just don't care.  I really hate that I will read more heroes and villains in the near future but I won't be reading a book with much fun.  One problem with a book is that it's just too complicated for it's own good.   So, what about it?   I can appreciate the sentiment behind this book. As a person who is on the fence about the superhero genre, this is a great way to convince me that the genre isn't completely overrated. I'm a huge fan of the comics as well so I can empathize with those who are afraid to dive into the genre. I don't disagree with them, but this is not a book that will make me want to go back to comics (for good).  The only issue I have with the book is the end.  It's confusing. There is a lot of stuff to keep up with at the end and some questions left hanging. Maybe the series will continue after it's complete but I would be interested to see how the plot will play out after that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be boring and a little boring.   The author takes a very simple premise and attempts to cram a lot of information into it.  The book was full of unnecessary details that didn't add anything to the story.  It's as if the author just thought about the idea for a long time and couldn't come up with anything else.  Unfortunately the characters were also terrible.  There was one character that I didn't like or believe in, and another that I couldn't connect with.  I will probably just ignore this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book at all, and my brother and I didn't want to read it, but then we had to because our kids are going to a sleep over at grandma's and we couldn't take the time to read a book that was about the end of the world and all the different groups coming together to fight the end.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most boring book I've read in a long time!   If I didn't know that the author is an A&R for a popular music label, I would have never guessed it was written by a kid from Texas.   It would have been so much better if they just re-recorded it with all of the songs changed to something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a classic SF/F story that will have you wondering where all the time went, this is the book for you.   I was disappointed by this, mainly because it wasn't a great story, but more of a good story with a lot of holes in the story.  The plot is very interesting, with interesting characters and a lot going on.  I really liked how it turned out, and I liked a lot about it.  You could easily do with some more background information about the story and characters to keep the book going, and there was some of that too.  Overall, not a bad novel, and not a very good novel either.  This book was recommended by my editor at the time, and it has since appeared in the collection of stories "Shoot the Moon" (also published by Tor Books).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   So a new book I am going to give a very poor rating. It is hard to say the good about it. It feels like a poor effort of an author to write about this subject, but I suppose it is only a book so what do you expect? I would not recommend this book unless you are looking for a good horror story about a woman with a strange curse who moves in with a creepy old couple, as that is the main theme. A girl that was adopted by a mother that was very abusive is thrown into a house and must take the role of the "monster" or else. The book is so confusing and so boring and the characters are so one note it is very hard to really get invested in anything going on. I don't even care who the main female character is, the book just never goes anywhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "What a load of crap!" -   "I was a bit skeptical when I first heard about this but decided to give it a try. If you are interested in a fun read I can see why you would be a fan of the series." -
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was very poorly written and it took me a long time to finish it. If you liked the book, you will like the sequel. The main character is not very likable. He is a bit of a scoundrel and I did not find his actions justified at all. I don't think he is evil. He does do evil things but they are not as bad as the characters in the book think they are.   The writing is very bad and I think it was the author's fault that the story was so bad. He uses all kinds of tricks to make the reader feel more enticed to read more and the plot turns out to be a little boring. There is nothing new about the story and the author tried to reinvent the wheel. You are supposed to be bored by the book to a certain degree but you should not be bored to a painful degree. A good novel has something to do with the protagonist and how he deals with the situations he faces. If you dislike the character, don't read it.   A good book is not one that gives you everything you want to read. The author tries to give the reader something new but he overuses the same tricks and the story starts to become boring. He has also to use many tricks to convince the reader that it's the protagonist's fault. The author's attempts to make you feel better after reading the book were not very convincing.     "The book itself is quite interesting and I found it entertaining but I'm not entirely impressed, and I can't give it a rating higher than two stars, I will admit that."   -- A friend of mine
Write a negative review about a bad book:      1. The plot is really hard to follow. The story is full of random events and it is hard to really know who is who. This book is too long and a bad plot makes it hard to read. I would have liked to get more of the story if the plot was better.   2. I really hate all the stupid dialogues. They were hard to understand. Most of them were the same line over and over. The dialogues made my eyes water.     3. The main character is so annoying. I could barely stand the main character. It just made me want to run.   is a book. The bad points are that it is too much to understand at the start and it doesn't build up. This is one of those books that i want to finish but then never will because of the many problems.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem with this book is not just that it is over 300 pages long but that it never actually reads. The prose reads like it was ripped off from a novel, but the plot seems to be a direct rip-off from the Star Trek movie'First Contact ', the story is boring to the point of being uninteresting. In'First Flight'there are a total of nine ships that make up the Federation Fleet, so the plot takes the form of the Enterprise in space searching for these nine ships, each of whom seems to have a story to tell and at least three of whom have very real chances to save the day. In the end the Enterprise is stranded in an uncharted region of the galaxy and it's up to each of the ships to fight for survival and to discover why they are where they are. Well, except for the third ship. As soon as she appeared the plot devolved into a generic space opera with no sense of character. The other ship, the Reliant, seems to exist only to be mentioned twice. The final confrontation between Picard and his old friend from the Ktarian military academy, Tuvok, has absolutely nothing to do with what actually happened. The ending of the book leaves the reader feeling like Picard is going to end up as a vegetable.   I am still hoping this book gets another chance to go out into the market. There is so much potential in this story and it could be amazing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As others have said, the writing style is atrocious. I hate to say this, because it is a great novel, but the writing is so bad, I would find it easier to be impressed with the book's characters if I didn't have to spend so much time trying to describe how awful the writing was. I'm afraid I'll need to start reading other works in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about two teenagers, Emily and Daniel, who discover their mother's mysterious disappearance. Both of the characters are smart and well developed. The plot was a little hard to follow at times, but it was still readable.   I found the writing style quite enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't care for this book. The characters were all unlikable and uninspired, the plot felt too contrived, the pacing was choppy, the writing itself was atrocious. If you read it for the plot and world building and you find it lacking that's because you can't be bothered to read anything else. If, however, you enjoy a good, funny, fast paced book with a strong premise this one's probably for you. If I had to guess I would say it will be worth the read, but that's the only positive I can put on it. The bad, and I mean awful, parts of the book were just so bad I can't recommend it at all. I'll be sure to read the sequel. I would recommend the plot to anyone who enjoys a good book and wants a plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am one of the few people that like the books from the new series by Mark Lawrence (The Dagger and the Coin). I have not read the older books by Mark and the others but this one seems ok to me, if I read it like an average book (which it is not). However I cannot stand the author, who has a nasty, self absorbed, selfish personality. I have read a number of other reviews by other people about Mark and his book I did not understand them at all. They were not that bad. I mean they are well written, well researched and well thought out. But the author had a nasty personality that seemed to have been built on a foundation of lies and deceptions. I can understand if a book was written for children and was meant to entertain children. However in this case it seems to be written as a revenge fantasy book where the author was being punished and wanted to punish the author in return and wanted it to seem that the author got the worst of it. I cannot believe this guy is still in publishing. I don't see why people will continue to buy his books that have these characters and are not that great, he is a horrible writer and the way he wrote this book was disgusting. I guess the readers of this book would not be bothered to read a bad review.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book a bore. This is a collection of poetry, and I was surprised how few poems there are in the book. The poems are all about a single topic, which is the weather, and they each do a good job at summarizing how the weather is and is not. The poet makes you sit there with a smile and think, but it's a boring way to spend your time. The poetry is also not the best, and there are a number of lines that have an awkward feeling about them that didn't impress me. There were a few sentences that seemed out of place in the context of the book, as well, but they're not worth skipping, and when you get through them, you'll come back to them. It's also a good way to learn about how many different kinds of poems exist, and the variety of poems within a single category is really interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very bad book. I was expecting something very good, but it turned out to be a lot of filler. The whole point of the book was to have a series of "filler stories" about the people who are still alive in the world of the story. But all of the stories about the living were so cliched, I was left wondering why I needed to read about them. They were too stupid. The writing was also very sloppy and I had to go back and re-read the same scene twice. There were many instances where I could tell the author was just taking out whatever little he could find to make the book more entertaining. One example, I think, was the whole plot about a little girl getting lost in a giant field with a giant giant boy. They are on a quest together and in the end, she turns out to have some giant monster friends. But the little boy is the only one able to rescue them. What a waste of space. (hide spoiler)

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a great fan of the Harry Potter books. But this one's not much fun. First, there's a serious lack of plot. The main characters (a young boy and his dog) have all the important, action-adventure stuff. The "hero" is in love, but is too embarrassed to tell anyone, not even the parents, that he's in love. His "heroic" journey has been made up entirely of small-town trips, his parents never come by to see him off, and there's always something odd going on with his dog. There are, of course, some fun scenes and a lot of great writing, but overall this book lacks the adventure, romance, and action of the books. Second, the writing is painfully unfunny. The humor is there, it's just the writing that's lacking. Third, the main characters are very unlikable. My favorite characters are Sirius and James, but they're both despicable. Sirius's relationship with the "evil" Petunia is just stupid. Harry is a pathetic loser who tries to become a Quidditch star. This book is like a bad romantic comedy about three middle-aged people with very limited horizons who go on trips together to see relatives, but the writers couldn't find a way to make Harry funny. I couldn't take it and gave up after the third book. Fourth, the story isn't very coherent. I'm still wondering why the boy, with all his "magical" gifts, can't do better than just walking away from his parents. Maybe it's because it takes place during the Quiddich season, so everyone is wearing pink. Fifth, if you're looking for a laugh, try "A Dog's Life." 6 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to get a new book from Harper's last year. It was awful.   The authors are just trying to get back at the publishers and publishers are taking advantage.  And yet... it is a little hard to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book a while ago, and it was pretty enjoyable. I really liked the setting and how it would be played out (I'm playing with a group of characters who don't seem to have a clue why the world is the way it is). It's pretty light and silly, so it isn't like heavy stuff, but it still seems very fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me until I got this book to realise that I am not really a fan of the series, but I still felt this book was a bit of a disappointment to me.   I have a difficult time believing in good 'evil' and I can easily see why this book is considered by many as being the worst of the seven novels.  I really should have read the sequel (in a series which I would probably have liked better than this) but this one was just not for me, maybe I just don't like it as much as the other novels and the characterisation was a little off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In a way it is all I have to say about this book. I found the main character to be a little dull. The author is no better than other writers who give the "evil" character some depth. The bad guy was kind of likable. The plot line is somewhat complicated. I have a feeling the author was not a fan of this book. "When it came time to put out the trash the owner of the shop asked me to look for a book about a monster that lives in a book.   "The Monster in the Hat" I said.  "If you ever find a book that is about a Monster you will be able to tell me what kind of monster it is."   The owner looked at me in disgust.  I couldn't get a name out of him. "How did you know the Monster's name?" he asked. "It was in my book, you know that."        "I won't buy the book again."  I said as I left. "I want you to read this book." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was too slow. You could have gotten something more out of it if you spent more time on it. The beginning is so slow that you forget what the rest is about, and then when it finally does pick up a bit, the story is way to dense to take you there.   My rating: 5 stars  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a huge disappointment for me, and it came from my husband's collection. He loved the book and I loved the cover art, but as soon as I started reading I had to stop. My husband is a huge fan of Tolkien, but I'm not a big fan of fantasy, so I didn't enjoy this book that much. As it is, I think I will pass this book on to my children and I don't really want to read anything else by Tolkien (but I'm waiting for the video game!).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself has lots of good information. Some of the info was good for the purposes of this book, but others are vague or hard to interpret. For instance, what "the world is ruled by a shadow government" meant is unclear to me. I mean, you mention the shadow government, but not that they run everything. Or, what are you suggesting that the Shadow government would do in the face of a crisis? (And is it really a crisis, or just a war with an other-worldly enemy? I'm not even sure what a crisis is in this book.) I mean...it's a good book, just not great.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are two kinds of people in this world; those who like it, and those who can't stand it. This book is one of those, which is why I've rated it a 4. In my opinion, "The Road Not Taken" is one the worst books I've ever read, ever. In fact, I've read more than a few books of this type, and I've never once felt that I wanted to throw this book out in disgust. Why? Because I can still appreciate a good book... I think a lot of authors, including Cormac McCarthy, have fallen into the trap that Cormac has, and it's a shame, because Cormac's prose is so well crafted that the worst parts of his writing are well done and engaging. Unfortunately, this is just another example of that. I just can't get on board with the book as it stands, and in the end, I just find myself more frustrated and angry that the author doesn't seem to care that people may be annoyed by the book, which makes the reader think, "well, this isn't a good read, but I've still got to keep reading it, because I have to try to understand what this guy is trying to do." I could understand why he had to write this book, because he has been on the run for a very long time and wants to write a book about what he's done with himself, but if he really wanted to do a book of this nature, he could have put in more effort into it. If it wasn't this bad, I could see a lot more people enjoying it... I just really feel like I'm giving Cormac a bum's rush, but he seems to have gone over a cliff, and there's not really anything to come down from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a reader who has had issues with the Harry Potter series. The main problem is that they seem to change from book to book. There are so many plots which all seem to be set up for a few books and then they all get dropped into each others' laps. There is so much to say about it, but I will refrain from saying it. Instead, I will talk about what happened to Harry at the end of this book.  This is how Harry dies:  This is how the book ends:    Harry dies.    There is nothing much to be said about this, except that it is the end.  The author uses this death to tell the story of Harry's love life and the death of Voldemort.  I liked this so much because it makes me think, "Oh, what could have been?"  But the story is not about Harry.  This ends up being an unnecessary twist to the plot.  When Harry dies, he takes the place of Draco, not Dumbledore, and is left to rot in Malfoy Manor.  It is a waste of a perfectly good character.  How does the author think Draco could have had any real fun with Hermione when Draco's dead, especially since there are only three characters left?   The story takes a detour with some of Draco's relationships, but then the plot is back to the main focus, Draco and Harry.   And Draco's "fun" with Hermione is very much focused on the two of them in the Forbidden Forest.    I was disappointed that Hermione is not even mentioned in the book.     So what do I think about the Harry series?  I have no idea.  What I have read I have liked and what I haven't read I don't like.  All I can say is that it may be good if you have kids. I have never written about this so I'm not sure if it would help any parents.  A big complaint I hear is that Harry should be the main character in the books.  But I think it is wrong to say that.  In order for a character to be the center of the story, they have to have a lot of depth.  For example, Dumbledore in the series has more depth than Snape.  Snape's motivation in the novels is so weak that it takes up an entire book, while Dumbledore's motivations are much better.  Harry's motivation was good, but it was
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just read this book and I felt   that the characters and writing are a bit like an old man in a wheelchair walking through the city streets. I think that is exactly what he needs   so that he can enjoy his life   in the way that he wants to   without having to walk in a wheel chair all the time   for a change   as everyone else   must   be like him   - I will be reading the sequel and will see how much of an improvement   this time around. I thought that the plot was a little slow but maybe the next book will be different - it was a fun read though, no spoilers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a man's journey through a world of women and is not very compelling, except maybe for a little bit of insight into the world of dating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this a 5 star review because it's just a very good story with a lot of depth. However the ending leaves a lot to be desired. Not only is it rushed, but the ending is also not what I was expecting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would've done better with another book I read. The plot is interesting but the characters are bland and the setting is really only a backdrop to the action and plot. It's a shame as I enjoyed the book, but this isn't a good read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking for a short book about the Holocaust, but wasn't really prepared for the length of the book. Not only does it cover everything (all the camps, all the ghettos, all that stuff), it covers it all so well that it is almost unbelievable. The prose is so smooth, the plot is so well conceived and the characters so well developed, that it really made the most of the Holocaust for me, and made me really want to get a copy for my collection.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm an English major at an American college, and I'm still not sure what the hell happened. It was the least original work I've ever read. The book is an exploration of an Indian philosophy, but it doesn't make much sense and the author doesn't really care. Also, the book is written in the vernacular, which means that you have to take the author's words about what the philosophy means as gospel. Also it was a bit of a hassle to read, but that's to be expected with a book from a self-published author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was like reading a book from the 60's. The main character, Maitland, is a wacky old guy who tries to teach the reader some basic math. This leads to a lot of the book being a lot more funny than it otherwise would have been. Maitfion doesn't really care about anything, he has a huge ego and likes to put other people down, but he's funny at least! There's lots of great writing and I learned something about something new at least.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this in October 2011 and it wasn't until I had read the other two books in the series (The Shadow of the Wind and The Shadow of a Knife) that I realized I had made the wrong decision! This is a fairly boring book with a story that's hard to connect with and a plot that's so rushed it doesn't have a sense of momentum. While there are good parts in this book, a lot of the "twist" (whatever that means) of the story seems forced to me. For example, after the second book I couldn't fathom the whole murder thing, so in The Shadow Trilogy, I'd really prefer to see the plot unfold through the eyes of a character I could relate to more than through a character in this books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot of fiction and nonfiction and this was the most horrible book I have ever read in my life. I tried to give it 3 stars because this book wasn't bad but it really did not belong in a book club or an audiobook library. There was very little character development and I am not sure if she is a victim or a hero. I hope she does something with her life but I think I may need a psychologist or psychiatrist before I listen to her story one more time. The plot is really lame and I did not care much about the main character because there were so many characters, who I could not keep track of. Also, if you have a problem with the story I highly recommend that you listen to another book, there are better books out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As mentioned, this book is full of cliches and it's just not worth my time. I'm not even a big fantasy fan. A few of the characters are flat. Some of the magic was way over the top and the setting is boring and uninteresting. The story is slow going with little resolution and I found myself tired of reading it, even though the author is trying to stay funny and the plot is intriguing enough to keep me turning the page.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, R.A. Salvatore, has a unique voice that is very entertaining, but he tends to write about the same issues with an almost identical format for every book. The first book is a good introduction to Salvatores work, but the second is just not as good. It starts off with a nice setup of how Salvatorn became a comic book artist, how he got into crime, and then ends with him in a hospital. The third book gets a little better, but it still lacks the quality of the previous two. The fourth and final book, however, is just great and is one of the most fun comic book stories ever written. I highly recommend this book to any fan of crime comics.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a train wreck. It does not give you the whole story. I just went through the whole thing. I liked the characters.   The problem is that there is no story, nothing else that really connects with the book. The characters are so bland and the book is so dull that you want to throw it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about the book is the first person, it is a bit like a journal/memoir.   You don't get the best of both worlds here. I would recommend it to someone who enjoys historical fiction and the style. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried this book because my husband was a big fan of the movie. But I think the book should have been called " The Return of the Master " and was better and different. I don't think it was a good movie in my opinion. I think it is just a movie to make money for its producers and to create a sequel to the original movie. The movie has the same story and the same characters. This book doesn't have the same quality as the movie and the story is very different and very good. The characters are so cool and the writing is so good. It is fun reading about a group of kids that are trying to find the lost book that the other characters are looking for. One thing that bothered me with the movie is that in the movie the books were so far out of reach. I never found the book on my own so I thought it was too difficult to find. But this book is so much more than that. It teaches the main character that he is a better person because he is on a quest to find his book and he does not know what it is. He doesn't know what the rules are that make him good and how he can make people do his will. He never knows that all he needs to do is be honest and open and that he has to be a good listener. He gets to meet his friends and learn from them about being a good person. I just hope that the movie doesn't change his character because I think he needs more growth. I give this book 5 stars because of how much it teaches about being the best and being nice to others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on a whim after reading a book by an author I loved that turned out to be a disappointment, and I decided to give it a try. I found this book to be very frustrating and depressing, especially the last third of the book. I hated the end of the story. It was the last part where the main character had a chance to do something to make things right, and she decided to just say 'goodbye' to the family. She really shouldn't have done that, as it was the biggest opportunity of her life and it could have been the start of something great for her.   The reason she left was because her dad had just died, which is extremely sad to hear about, but then the story does take place at a time when it seemed like the world was falling apart.  The author did this to make her main character seem more relatable and the story more reliving. The last third is just sad as well.  Overall I'd give this book two thumbs down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would give this book a 5 star review if I had read it before I finished the first volume. But then, I didn't. As I went along with the story, it became increasingly unclear as to what happened and why. I can't tell if it was intentional or if I just got lazy about reading, but the end was a little anticlimactic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What's here is a good story about a family man who is forced to have a son he doesn't want. This is one of those books that will keep your interest for pages and pages without getting to a satisfying ending. This book is about a man in love with his wife. He is constantly in danger of being rejected by her and being blamed for her behavior. It is a very painful book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had read "All the Birds in the Sky" as a Christmas gift for my wife. The cover is a nice way of saying the book is "bird-y". And the author really tries to make the whole thing feel like a good adventure. But, when the book actually starts, it feels like a bad Christmas movie. The story is based on "A Wrinkle in Time" by Madeleine L'Engle. The book starts when a boy named Willy finds a copy of "A Lesson in Time". Willy uses it to learn all about the different things he has ever seen, such as "Daffy Duck". He also gets a book about Santa Claus (not a bad one, but the one with the reindeer) and a list of things people have seen, including his mother. And Willy decides he has to go back in time to save Christmas. But is he going to get away with it? And what happens to his friend, his "Little Brother". After all, a child has to be in good care (by a loving father). The story gets off to a great start with the boy Willy, who seems to have a very cool head, and makes friends very quickly. Unfortunately for him, he learns just as much about the past as he does the present. The books is filled with good references and descriptions of what will become the future. And there are other interesting children's books in the world (such as "Mr. Tumnus", which has an alligator), but none are as good as "A History of Time". The characters are pretty bland, though. The main character is, for the most part, good for little boy. He is very brave (though he doesn't always know how to handle it), and kind, and has an interest in history. However, he is also very smart, and can make things quite complicated. When he doesn´t have a good understanding of a subject, he´s sometimes very frustrated. It feels like he is in the dark. He gets in lots of trouble for things that he just hasn´t realized. But he also seems to be pretty strong willed (despite the fact that he is a child). One thing that I did like about the story was that he always seemed to be able to figure things out without much help. He seems to just know a lot of things about the future, but has no experience in making things happen.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as an introduction to Buddhism and to Buddhism in America, but my expectations were not met. There were no points for insight, no examples of how to practice meditation and mindfulness, no advice about how to get into a meditation group.  I'm sure these are important things to do to improve my meditation, but I couldn't see how they were the main focus of this book. I suppose they were meant to introduce the ideas, but without any actual practice to back them up, it just didn't click with me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is great.   The story is interesting.  I was very excited to read this book. I hope I am not too late to the party to start my story on the next book in the series.  I really enjoyed the book and am very interested in seeing where the series goes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's kind of a big deal to me that a good author goes and kills a good story with a giant, stupid, out-of-character cliffhanger.   This doesn't mean it's bad.  I can't believe how much I've enjoyed this book - it's actually one of my favorites of the entire year!   But the book is too big and not in the way a good ending should be.  So it gets a 4/10: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got a chance to read this recently and I'm really glad I did. The book had a lot of potential but unfortunately, the author went and blew it, especially in the first chapter. While the author is trying to describe the power of love, this book was about the destruction of love. When I got to the first paragraph of the story, it made me think, "I'll never get over my ex-boyfriend!" It's like the author had a really bad ex-girlfriend and wanted to show the reader just how devastating it is to be left behind by a guy, so he ended up with the worst lover ever (in my opinion). I guess he was really looking forward to dating a new girl who wasn't the ex-lover from hell.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was too long, there was a lot of unnecessary "woe is me" and "wonderful guy" bits, and the ending sucked.    My Rating:  We are not at war. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about as good as it gets: the protagonist spends most of the book in the dungeon, but it's not a dungeon, or a castle, or even a dungeon with magic, so it isn't hard to tell when something's bad for the author, just not good for the story, and the protagonist's characterization is pretty bad. The plot is just okay, but even when I was expecting the novel to end with a cliffhanger I was disappointed because nothing happens.   I would read this again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book, and I am glad I did, although the author is a bit too busy to write a good book. If I was an aspiring writer, this book would have saved me a lot of time.   The author has good intentions and I do appreciate his effort.  I did not love the book, but it was good enough for me to buy it and read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have read this year. This book has no redeeming qualities other than being an attempt to cash in on the '90s nostalgia, which I hate. The only saving grace of this book was the narration and the acting. However, it's all just recycled dialogue from The Terminator or even the old sci-fi shows. I was hoping that the author would give some thought to a future that's in some ways worse than the present in this book (i.e. a world that has developed nanotechnology and is populated by mutants and/or humans with genetic disorders). The book is just an insult to anyone who has actually enjoyed a good science fiction book in the past few decades, such as the Star Trek, Harry Potter, or the Battlestar Galactica series. For those of you who don't remember it, the book is basically about a girl who dies and finds her consciousness inside of a robot that has been programmed to kill other people. This robot is actually a computer program created to help an AI that has just come to earth to study how it works in the first place. However as this world becomes more developed (i've been hearing rumors of nanotechnology being researched for a while now), the AI is found to be killing the people it programmed to help it and eventually it tries to kill this girl. The AI's creators, the supercomputer that created the program and the two people who were supposed to help make it into a program (who also happen to be supercomputer/AI hybrids), start bickering about the program's programming and what the best course of action might be, and then this robot decides it wants revenge on the people who programmed it. However when the girl who was killed by the AI shows up, the program decides that it should kill the girl so it can learn from her instead (I don't want to give away anything, but I believe the author is using nanotechnology to try and make his points) and the robot accidentally kills the girl. After this happens, the guy who built the program, the robot, and the supercomputere decide to join forces and take over the world, using the robot as a brain, computer, and translator. This is kind of a bad movie trope, but if you're familiar with Star Trek or the Matrix series, you might get some idea of how this is supposed to go down. Well, in this case, the only problem is the writer. The way the
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very good read, but I felt that the author's use of a simple, but effective technique in the beginning was a bit out of place.   I didn't mind the author using that technique too much, because it was good to learn something from him, but the use of it was too obvious, and didn't come out of the way that it needed to.  (review of free book) Review by: Andrew W. on Nov. 13, 2010 : I've been trying to get myself into writing for a long time now, and finally decided to give "The Storyteller" a try. I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I really enjoyed the way he presented the subject, it had some interesting aspects to it, and I enjoyed reading the whole thing. (review of paid book)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had this book for a little over a year before giving it back.   What a disappointment.  The pacing is horrible and the characters are shallow and uninteresting.  I was expecting more from a fantasy book but all I got was a "what-is-this" story about the main character who is a mage.  I didn't mind the main characters so much though, I felt like I was watching a really dumb kid play on a computer in front of me, but that didn't really bother me either.  It was the way the characters behaved and their relationship to one another. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was okay - nothing to write home about.   I have to say I never finished it.  The pacing was very sloppy - and the pacing of the story is the reason that I gave this 3 stars.  And the plot is so poor!  It was too obvious that this is a very early 19th century story (and yet we have the same characters!)  I was expecting some more mature twists and turns, but instead it is so predictable that I was unable to get interested.  I did not enjoy the end of the book.  Overall, I just couldn't help but feel disappointed by this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a young adult, in 2000.   This book was really bad, very hard to understand and the story wasn't interesting at all.  I'm sorry but it's not worth wasting your money on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -   I'm not sure if this is a new novel or the series of novels, and although I liked the first novel I can't say I enjoyed the next two. The first three books seemed to be trying to do the 'Tolkien meets Tolkien' thing, with little success. The third novel has Tolkien's 'Middle Earth' being depicted as a more gothic and medieval setting, which seemed a little off to me. The characters are all well done, and I like their personalities. They're more like what I thought of as the 'Nordic types', so the character of Thorin would be very appealing to me, as I like to read a good book that makes me want to buy more books from it's authors (not just the first) :)   The world building is very well done.   Unfortunately, I think the characters are a bit bland, as they're only really interesting if you have the knowledge of the history of the world (especially the 'Silmarillion' of Tolkien). I would have liked a little more back story from some of the characters, particularly the dwarves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story, though the narrator tried to create some sort of suspense, was a complete waste of time.    The only reason I enjoyed the book was because the characters were interesting.  This is just a sad story about two idiots who are never even asked a question.  If you read this, I hope you enjoy it just enough to read the next one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so poorly written and presented that it made it impossible to follow the plot. It was so difficult to understand how the characters would ever be able to make it out of the island alive. The plot twists were so random, random, that I did not know if there was a logical connection.   And most of all, it was an awful and cheap story that I can't believe even was published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "It is an exercise in intellectual laziness." - Mark Waid, Author of Iron Man 3 "It's about as exciting as reading the same chapter over and over" - David J. Peterson, Editor, New York Times Book Review "You might as well read a page-and-a-half of this book. It is uneventful and boring" - James S.A. Corey, Author, The Expanse "The more I read, the more I realize this book is just as boring as everything else I've read. This is the most boring, repetitive, unimaginative book I have ever read." - John Scalzi, Author Of Old Man's War "This is the worst book I've ever read... If this was a movie, I'd have quit watching by now." - Brandon Sanderson, Author Book #1 of The Stormlight Archive "It feels like I read the same book every day." - David Barr Kirtley, Author "The book is so repetitive it makes The Big Short seem like an entertaining biography." - Matthew Quick, Author The Book Smugglers "The books are like a long car ride in a snowstorm - it's not fun, it's just tedious" - L.E. Modesitt, Author This review is about what I thought was going to be a really good book, but I just realized after reading it that it is just boring. What's even worse is the fact that this is a book that was originally meant to be the next big thing... but it's really just a slog! There's almost nothing new in here. The authors claim to be trying to explain how humans interact with technology, but that's really not the case. They just repeat the same boring, recycled material in different contexts, as if they knew what was going on but just forgot to write about it. I can't believe I even bothered to get through this book... it's so dull I just want to give it up. I'm disappointed that the authors were forced to publish this to keep people buying their books. It just shows that there's a market for this kind of book - I guess you have to have a few good ones to make money. (But the fact is that I wouldn't have bought this book even if the book had been good.) That said, I wish the book hadn't bothered to make me read it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot of this book is about a very specific group of people who can't stand each other and have a terrible fight (with a huge misunderstanding of what is and is not okay to fight about) after one of the people in their group takes a shine to the other girl.   However this is a fantasy world and in this world fighting is okay, just as long as you get to know the characters and respect their beliefs.  The book takes place in a small town where one of a group of "warriors" who wear the armor of a dragon fight other people who wear it to fight the dragons that invade their home. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the book on a whim because I like to use the "read it and pass it on" attitude when reading books. I'm an American and I love the idea of reading books (and reading books at the same time!). I thought the book would give me a different way to look at some classic books, and it did, sort of.   My experience with this book was similar to my experiences with this author's previous works - I thought that the first half of the book was good, I enjoyed the "first" part more than the "second" part, but the rest was garbage.  So let's start with the good first. The writing is good - a lot of the time.  The story of a young boy discovering a treasure in a cave is very well done, and he's very interested in his treasure, even if it means breaking into the cave.  This book is about exploration, adventure, friendship, curiosity, and sometimes, it's a good mix of those things.  And then the second half came along - it was a disaster.  It was hard to put down, it had a lot going on, and the author wasn't even close to good at explaining it all.  I will try to describe as much of the "bad" parts as I can, but be warned - there are some parts that will make you wince a lot, but I still enjoyed them.  My "bad parts" are just that - my "bad".  So, in summary, if you are an explorer, you should read this, not because of the premise or the premise is good, but because of its writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is only so much you can say about a book before you have to go out and buy it.   I thought this book was good, but the story did not capture the character development I expected from the author.  I didn't feel that the story was very strong, and the author seemed to have forgotten how to write about a family in this book. I think it was one of the first books that had a very strong character in the lead.  It seemed that the author was trying to write more for a family of the 1950s than a modern day family.  If you like a good book and don't expect much from it, then this book may be right up your alley. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is about a girl and the boy she marries and is in love with. A man wants to be a father to her child but the girl does not want a father, it is all up to her to raise the child. At times I thought the author could have written a very well written book but at other times, I was annoyed that I had to wait for the story to get to the good parts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a collection of short stories, some of which are funny, some are tragic, some take place in a place or situation that is impossible to find in reality. I did enjoy the stories, but I thought the writing could have been done better. I would recommend this book to everyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   When the plot seems to go nowhere and the characters are a series of one-dimensional archetypes, I can't recommend this book much more than a one-star review. It's a pretty standard fantasy thriller: a woman is kidnapped by evil mages, and she gets rescued by a heroic fighter. The plot eventually goes nowhere, and the ending is predictable. The characters are like the characters in other fantasy novels: bland, shallow, one-note. And the prose is just awful. This is one of the worst fantasy novels I've read in years.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a bad novel, but a book that can be enjoyed as a short read, or for quick entertainment. The book has a lot of flaws that do affect the book for the reader, and there are some good parts to this story. There is some good character development in this book. There were some flaws in the story, however, that could be addressed with some more character development, and this story could have had better ending. It's a fun short read and if you are looking for a quick read with a bit of character development and adventure.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So the book is very short (5 pages), but it contains some good ideas. The book mentions some ideas like the mind is a closed system, and that is true. The mind is like an aquarium, and when an idea enters it will be either accepted or rejected by the mind. But when that idea comes from an outside source (e.g. the media), it will likely be rejected. However, the ideas from outside are also being absorbed by the brain. So the ideas may be accepted but when they are from outside sources, they are not very good. One of the ideas that was mentioned is that we are not conscious about the actions that are happening in our brain, but this is actually an idea that is in the scientific literature and it has a number of scientific support. However the book does not give enough of a description of how the ideas work or how the scientific data is used in support. Overall a good book that is worth a read, just keep in mind that if the idea comes via the media or from a book, it is a good idea, but it might be a poor idea for someone who needs a real change in their thinking.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      " This book is terrible... It was the first time I had tried to read a book on my own in some years. I had read many of the previous authors on this website, I did not know what to expect or what I should read.   "   I was really looking forward to this book as I've read many other authors on my forum. I was a little disappointed in this one and I would only recommend this to a friend. I did find the characters of the other authors to be much more interesting than the author of this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first couple of times I read this book I was in a bit of a dilemma. I really liked this book. I think that the protagonist is really the one to blame for her actions. She's so nice and is the person who takes the brunt of it. Her parents had an affair and she was manipulated into it by her father. Then she meets a man that she thinks will help her with the money but the relationship between them doesn't go far beyond that. Then the book ends, and the character who we thought was the bad guy gets a new love interest. I felt like it was a bit pointless to bring the character back. In a way I think the author went too far. It seemed a bit like a love triangle, but really there is no way that the two will end up together.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter series, and this is not only the most recent but the best book in the series. The characters are great, the plot is great, and the world building is magnificent. I would have loved a bit more of a 'final battle' in the book. But overall a good book.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book by a different author. I read it the first time last year in college, I loved it but after a couple of years of being a bit bored I stopped it and then had this book recommended to me again. I still loved it (and read it again), I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. The ending was so confusing. The narrator, Laura's mother, says she knows the ending because she wrote it herself. The thing is, this is a completely different book. I can't say anything negative about this book because it's a pretty good read, but it has some weird endings that have me worried that it was written by a woman with a bad hand.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The cover looks really good, but there is a lot of spelling errors, so this might be a little hard to find a copy of.   If I were the kind of person who goes through the whole list of book covers on Amazon, I might be less than happy.  The cover of the book doesn't look as good as the cover of most other books I have (it's hard to be excited about this book when the cover looks like the cover to a generic mystery novel) but this book is so close to perfect that I'm willing to forgive the book's shortcomings. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't really know what to say about this book. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend because I didn't like much of the previous books that I've read, and wanted to try this one. My first reaction to this book was that it was hard to get into; the narrator and the dialogue and the characters were very hard to listen to for me. My second thought was that this is a difficult book, it's not like the kind of book where you can read it in one sitting and forget what's going on. This is a book that you read in chunks, and it has its merits. But I'm not sure if I would recommend this one to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     If this book has any redeeming value at all it's in the character development. The two main characters are introduced well. The first is a lonely man who is always in search of a companion. The other is a young boy who becomes the father of the lonely man. Both are portrayed with a good deal of sympathy.   The author really does a good job of making the characters believable and human.  :o:  If this book is on a shelf with a lot of other books, I'd go grab it... But if you can find it, don't waste your money!The author spends too much time explaining things about the characters and the world that you already know. There's a bit of an obvious world building theme going on in this book but the book's not very good about making you care about what's happening. You'll see what I mean when you finish the book, but not until a few hundred pages in.The one redeeming quality about this book though is the character of the mother who is a wonderful human being. I'd say she had a lot more development than the other main characters. She's a good mother and a very good friend.The other main character was a bit lacking in personality. His father is a very different person in the book than in real life. The way he acts in real-life is so different than how he acted in this story. And I think that's the main problem of this book: The author's world building is a bit off. I've read a lot about the world but the world building in this novel is a little off. It's just not quite right.It's a book you have to read for yourself to understand why I was so unimpressed with it. It isn't a book that I will read again. It does have some good moments and some moments of enjoyment, but it's not one that I would re-read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a joke, the author claims that his book is an expose about the corrupt system of medicine. The only problem with his claims is that the book is about his personal experience as a doctor in a hospital which has been forced to close down due to lack of funding.   The main flaw of his book that I have to say is that his explanations of medical concepts such as: "Sickle cells are the culprit" and "Pleurisy is caused by infection" are very bad. He should have made it clear to the reader that there is no evidence to support the claims that such theories are correct, and that the medical community actually know that they are wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story itself was okay; not my favorite story, but not the worst. It was a nice change of pace from the more serious and gritty stories I've read. The plot had a good amount of mystery, but it never made it to a climax or felt real. I had some fun with the characters, although it was all in the past tense. The ending was a bit confusing, and there were just some things that just didn't add up to me. Overall though, it wasn't a bad story, and if you've never read it, I'd recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a collection of short stories that are really really bad. It started out as a really interesting collection of stories, but they got so bad at the end that I started reading some of the reviews for a few chapters and realized they were all basically the same story. So I decided to stop reading because I was tired of reading so many stories about stupid people who got hurt, or stupid characters who got killed, or people who just didn't have enough money or were too lazy to save a pet. Overall, this book had some interesting ideas in it, but the author failed to realize how poorly they all turned out and it's a complete waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I have tried a couple of times to write a review about this book, because I know that most of the people reading this are already fans of the series.   As a matter of fact, this book is a great example of why I am a big fan of the books.  The worldbuilding is awesome (more on that later) and the characters are very well done.  As for the story, I really enjoyed it.  It starts off really slow and then, over the course of several books, builds towards a climactic battle which the characters win.  I also liked the fact that the author tries to make the setting seem a little bit more real, especially with the use of the sea.  After a while, however, I became impatient with the pacing and, in the end, didn't really care about any of the characters.  This was more of a problem with the characters of "The Bone Clocks" than anything else.  If I was to rate this book on the basis of its setting and worldbuilding alone, I would rate it a solid 3 stars.  For those who are into historical fiction, I'd give it a 1/2 star.  However, in a genre like historical fiction it is a bit more important than I expected.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really did not expect to get this book.   There are plenty of books I think I would enjoy, but would not consider buying.  The books I enjoy are often very complex and well written.  A bit more lighthearted than my preferred type of SF, but still worth the price.  This one is not so much fun, it's just fun to read about space ships, people who live on different worlds, and alien races.  My favorite of the three books I've bought from her, it was definitely a very good read, but not as fun to listen to as the other two books I purchased.  I hope to be back next year!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does nothing but waste your time.  It is not interesting at all.  I'm sorry, but I do not want to know who the woman was and what her motivation was.  Also, what the heck was the title of this book about?  I don't even like the author's names at all... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very good for what it is. It is written in an entertaining style and contains a lot of information. I really enjoyed it because it really made me appreciate some things I would normally dismiss as useless, such as "The Unbearable Silence" and "The Last Dancer" by the authors of "The Magician's Land." My only negative point was that there were some errors that were very hard to notice in a book about magic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very enjoyable read but for the wrong reasons. My friends and I spent an awful lot of time debating about the book's themes. I think the book is a really good exploration of the relationship between sex and identity and how sex can be used to create or destroy a person's identity. It's certainly not an ideal read for the whole family. But if you want to get a kick out of a good book about gender and sexuality (and you've never read one about either of those), this is one I'd recommend.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to receive the ARC of this book. I really loved the previous book by this author. The worldbuilding, the dialogue, and the story were so good that I was almost hoping to reread that book. And I am so happy that I reread this book because this book is not quite as good.   There are some things about this book that were very intriguing. I do enjoy the story. I think it has the potential to be very interesting, though I am not sure I like all the characters (I am not a fan of people who don't have a plan of action). The world building is great, but it is all done very organically. I feel that if you want a good world building book, you should read up on the previous two books, because it really is amazing what these authors have done. I just wish it had a little more going on in this book (like there is a story here, and some things aren't right).   In general I was surprised how quickly I found that I had read this book in the first place. It is a short book, and it was great for a short novel. The narrative is very fast paced. It was nice that I could skip ahead and read more if I wanted. The characters are really well developed, and I like the way that they relate to each other. They are all very interesting. I am glad that the book was short, so that I can get a good read out of it. It will probably be a while until I am rereading this book, but I would recommend this for anyone that likes short fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a bit of a slog to read and is filled with a lot of information that you don't need to know. Not a lot you could use it for in a real life situation.   If you're looking for a good book on how to deal with a bad boss, this is a good one.  11. The Way of the Superior Man : by Robert Greene (2014) The Way of The Superior Man is an interesting book, with a fascinating story. In a book that's only been around since 2013, a lot is still the same in this one, though a lot has changed over the last five years:    "There is a great opportunity for you to gain power, control, and authority that you have never had before."   The title of this book, though it seems rather self-serving, does seem to imply that the author thinks he can learn something about life from a book called The Way Of The Superior Male.  In a sense, that's true.  There are some things that you can gain from this book in life.  For example, some people (who are not me, but that's another topic entirely) may learn how to treat women better.  But I think that in most cases I can't learn from this one. The first thing you'll notice is that the title is a bit misleading. The book is not about being a better man, or even being a "better" person.  In the second chapter, Greene makes a brief and inaccurate description of being a woman: "Being a woman is a kind of power you can hold over people."    The second half of the book is about how men can become more powerful in relationships.  It is very much about "winning", "being a man", and being more dominant.  The story is not that the men need to be better than women, it is that they need to have more power in a relationship.  You may gain some insight into becoming better at your job, but if you really want to become better at being a man in a long term, you will need to learn how "to be a man."  12. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck : by Steven Pressfield (2012) For the most part, I dislike Steven Pressman's work.  He is often the most condescending person that I've ever heard and the whole book just seems really
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a bad one. The writing is very good and you'll enjoy it. The main character in the book is interesting and it was easy to root for him. However, I did find the story to be quite disjointed, and the writing was inconsistent and sometimes not as good as the writing in the novel. The story seemed to come together more in the last third of the book. But for the main character, it was a great story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't enjoy this book at all.   The story was boring, the characters weren't developed very much and the plot didn't feel very creative or exciting.  The writing is bad, it's really hard to tell if the author was trying to write a story or not, and it was really hard for me to keep reading.  At some points the story started to just be about setting up the conflict and not anything else.  It was really unfortunate that this was my first book of this series so I don't know if it will be a good or bad read for me, but if it turns out to be a very boring book, I will not be looking back.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the early years of my reading life, a book was not a book unless its author could make it look interesting. When I began my writing career in 1974, the novel was king and the book that came after that was just a slightly better version.   When I started in the seventies I read a lot of books (about 10 or 12 a year) about people that had gone to jail.  There was some good stuff, but I also came to realize that those authors had taken an important step backward and that what I wanted to write about had nothing to do with prison or the prisoners themselves.  By the time I was in college the literary culture had changed dramatically.  It had changed because the books about prisoners were less and less interesting. I'd read about prisoners in the paper and thought they were fascinating and that the prison was a fascinating place to write a novel about.  I got a degree in psychology and thought prison was the worst place in the world and that prison stories were about sad people trapped in a horrible situation.  (Maybe it was the fact that the majority of the writers were male, white and middle-class that led me to the wrong conclusion, but that was my mindset, and I could have changed it.)  (So did the guys I read about in prison, which is another reason why I thought the books were interesting.  What I wanted, I thought, was to write stories about people who'd gone to prison, but at the time when I was writing about them in prison it seemed that the only people who really went to prison were the white men who did.  Why? Because I didn't believe they ever went to jail; I believed that the vast majority of people who went to the prison were people like my characters.) I tried to write as many novels as I could about prisoners (and I mean really written about them, with a lot happening to them), but I couldn't find the time to do it, so I gave up.   The first novel I wrote in prison was not about prisoners, although I did write a whole novel about a prison, about a character who spent a lot in a prison.  Now I write novels about people in prison.   When I first got out, I didn not expect to write prison novels.  When we're talking about novels that have been written about people, it is true that I wrote a book about a white guy in prison who had been arrested, convicted and
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book about a year ago and I just finished it today (in the midst of some major procrastination).   This book focuses a great deal on the difference between the spiritual and the physical. And while I appreciate this focus, I am left wanting.   In many ways, the spiritual is easier than the physical (even though it's still hard to get a hang of it), but not completely easy. The spiritual is easy to "get" because it's simple and doesn't require a large amount of learning (like the physical), but the physical still requires a bit more effort (like it does in many "practical" spiritual books).   the spiritual also requires more practice, like a lot more, and often is not at all as enjoyable as it seems (at least not in my experience). The spiritual requires that the mind be at peace and calm and that all that really matters in life is the purpose of life and how you are doing as a human being. There are other things I found in this book that are more interesting than this, such as how one must deal with people and how they think.   This book can be a good source of inspiration for the self-disciplined or the those who are very disciplined, but I just can't help but wonder why someone would devote so much time and energy to these practices.   and of course it's very much a "self-help" book. There is a lot of advice and tips and tricks, and the author doesn't stop to explain any of it. And as a spiritual person, I'm sure this book will make me think more.   And while it's great to get more knowledge out of your own experiences, I do wonder why a spiritual book is a priority to the author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It took me a long time to finish this book. This book is full of holes and is badly written. I was very disappointed by this book, and I thought it would be good at the time I read it.   I'm glad I read the other reviews so I can say that this book is just a collection of stories. This one is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author spends about 70% of the book describing her own personal issues, while the remainder is a "how-to" on the use of steroids.   In my experience, most "how to" books are useless and a waste of money and time.  You do not need to spend over 500 dollars to buy this book.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about their sport. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You have to take away from this story that the only real goal the characters have in mind is to help others.  It's a "Good" story, but it was just too depressing and pointless for me to care about the characters.  The author should have given them a better goal, because their actions don't make sense to me.   The whole story is like this, with the characters just trying to survive because that is the only thing they have to eat.  I really liked the "bad" people, but I would have preferred them to have a goal other than "survive" and to do their jobs in a different way than just killing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping I was reading about a good experience. But this book is just a huge waste of your time. It's boring and uninteresting. There are no surprises, no good ideas, no characters with any depth or life beyond the fact that they were a couple for most of the book. This is a book that I will never read again, not with any degree of enjoyment, and I will be glad if this is the last I ever read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really have high expectations for this book. I don't like the first two novels of this series (especially "Flesh and Stone" ) and I can't imagine a good way to tie things together. The "Breath of Earth" is a collection of the two novels (as they should be) which are well written and good to read. However, the final three books are quite disappointing. This book is very disappointing. The story is not as good as the first three books, the pacing is a bit slow, and the plot is very confusing, confusing at times. The book does have the ending that I want (which I feel was the book's true purpose, to get me to read "Stones"). However, that ending is quite pointless, as it's very hard to follow what was going on in "Breathe of Earth," especially when there were very different story-lines going on with each of the characters. The whole "Hag's book" thing is pointless. It's a "secret" book that Hag can use to find a magic book. It might have worked if the book had ended after "Bath of Earth", which I guess could explain the book ending. But it's such a waste of time, as the book never explains where exactly Hag is going in the book. This has ruined the entire book for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book is really bad and I was pretty disappointed when I opened it and read about the protagonist's girlfriend, a 'chick with an attitude' type with her own problems... I really expected more from her. The book is about a girl (mystique) who is in a relationship with a guy named Michael who she likes a lot, but not everyone agrees with her decision to date him, and that's just the beginning of the story. You have to read a bit of the rest of the book to realize how the plot twists and turns and how much the writer has in store for the reader in terms of twists and surprises, and it just gets worse from there." (From Amazon Review of "Mister Miracle")   It would be nice to meet a guy like that someday.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I never read anything by the author of "The War of Art". I did like his other books (his previous one) so I bought this one thinking it would be a bit lighter than his other stuff (which is true). However, his latest book (which has nothing to do with art) seems like a really poor and insulting take on the book "The Artist as Craftsman" by the great George Lois. The main thing I find the most insulting in this book is that the author pretends to be a "real artist" (a good artist, but still not an artist). He makes it sound like he really is an artist, when in reality, he's a very mediocre painter who did a bad job. One thing I do like about his previous works is that he writes about painting and he tells it as if he was a good painter. In this book he pretends that he's an artist. I don't get the big deal about the book being about a book of short stories. It seems like he made up all these stories to make his book. One of the short stories in his book is about a real-life painter named Rembrandt. Rembrandte is supposedly a great artist. He's supposedly "one of the greats". So he's basically saying that he didn't think much about this painting, but it still shows his skills and talent. Of course, a real artist who doesn't know much about art would realize that the painting isn't good. Ofcourse Rembrand was not a great painter. So it seems that Mr. Zaz has really made up the stories to put a bad (but pretentious) spin on Rembrandtis' work. He also has some other bad reviews about his book which I'm not going to talk about since they are just as bad as the first two reviews. This book is just bad. I'm sorry that Mr Zaz tried his hand at writing a book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they have read his other work and they like pretentious writing. You can get the book from the Amazon link on my page.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very surprised that this book had no positive reviews on Amazon at all. The only negative reviews I could find were written by people who had already read the book, and had very negative views. I've never heard of such a thing. So, I guess the author thinks that if they keep on writing bad books that nobody will get upset and leave them. The writing is extremely sloppy and it's not a very good book for anyone who wants to read about a religion that is full of contradictions. The authors claim that the "religion" is only an aspect of a bigger story of the rise of man and the fall of the gods, which, the author says, is just a cover. And they try to make the religion into a religion for humans only. I don't see how people can be sure that there is such a big story behind the creation of the earth and that it is the only part. I just don't find this religion interesting at all, since the story is so weak. My friend gave me this book because it is one of those books that's really hard to get rid of once you start reading it. But you know that by the end of it, you won't have any interest left.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried reading this book about a year ago. I'm not a fan of fantasy, but the premise was intriguing. I love fantasy, so I bought the book with a high degree of expectations. I was not disappointed. The plot is cliche, but I'm sure it'll catch on with a few readers.   The plot was extremely predictable, and the characters were stereotypical.  I found it quite frustrating that the book is about a woman who becomes a demi-god when she can turn into a cat. The author is trying to create a story in which a woman becomes a cat god, but she fails in her task. The main character is too passive, and there is a constant hint to the readers that the main character won't accomplish her goal.  This book is also about a princess who can turn any object into another object. It was very interesting to me, because in reality, this princess does not transform anything into something else. She only changes the shape.  Another very disappointing part of the book. The hero spends most of the time in the palace, but spends most time playing with other girls. She never speaks, but just sits in the background.  What bothers me is that this book is full of things that are cliché, but still the reader is entertained. I would have loved to read a more realistic fantasy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just started reading this one, and while I think it will probably be good, it's the worst thing I've ever read. I just got done reading the first 3, and I thought I was going to be into it until the last 1. The whole book was just so preachy about how much a woman should sacrifice for her family, it was really hard to get into. The woman in the story was a terrible person and I felt sorry for her throughout the book because she was such a horrible person. I found her to be very unlikable and annoying and not very believable at all. The husband also was very unlikeable and I found myself wishing he would just end things with her so he could get on with his life. I don't know what the author is trying to do with this one. It's very preachy, and it was very boring reading it, because it made me angry every time she said something like "you just can't be a good mother if you don't do this or do that" because it just made my blood boil and I just didn't feel the need to get off of the couch to go and do whatever it is she was talking about. I am sure that if I was her husband I would have been very offended by her talk about the fact that I would be able to make more money as a housewife if I took some time off of work to make sure my wife was looked after and didn't make so many mistakes when it came to raising her kids. That's not a good reason to have a baby, I would think. And that was when I wasn't offended because the book was talking more about the man, and less about the woman and her own life choices. I hated this book and I will never, ever read it again. The story was great and interesting, I just couldn't get into it. It was all so preachish and it just didn''t make me feel anything. I hate that kind of stuff. Oh and I also have a problem with the fact the book made me hate my husband more than I hate the mother in the book. I guess because I felt so much for the mother that I wasn''t able to like her husband at all as much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very weak book that has no plot, characters, or direction. It's about a group of kids in the early 1980s who use their knowledge of the occult to find out what the Devil is up to. If you were thinking about reading this, don't.  This review would have been much longer if I didn't have to break it up by two words.   It was really hard to review a book that had no plot and had one of the most annoying characters that I've ever read.  The main character's mom and dad both die in the first half of the book (which is actually the first part of the plot). In the second half of book she's trying to save her friend from her ex (which doesn't make any sense) and she's got a boyfriend who's just an ex-boyfriend and she has a boyfriend in the future that she's going to lose.  What she's really trying to do is become a member of the Black Lodge. What a bummer that's the only thing she's ever really accomplished. I can't even imagine the book being as good if the author didn't tell us that she was one of those children who can tell how the Devil was working when she touched a picture of a dog.  It also has one of my all-time favourite chapters in the series.  But it was all over the place, so not sure if I can really compare this book to the other one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book for those who love dragons. What a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of horror.   But, even though this is not the greatest horror book by any means,   it is still very good.  The main villain is very interesting and very creepy.  I'd like to read the sequel, but I think I've seen enough of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was an interesting read about a group of soldiers who were sent to North Korea and the effects of their new found freedom on each other and life as a whole. The book itself was pretty good with a good balance of character development and action. However, the execution of the book is horrible. There are just so many bad, clichéd and one-dimensional characters that I just wish they would have killed each and every one of them. The story itself is pretty interesting and gives you a good feel for what life in the North is like.  There are a lot of terrible characters in this book, the worst is the leader, a leader who is so self-obsessed that he has a secret wife who is in a coma, the leader is also a sadistic sociopath who can't think beyond the immediate needs of the moment. The other main characters are also very dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I read this book and I'm so sad that I haven't finished it already.   The story's told in the first person and is told from the POV of a boy who goes through a whole hellish life with his father. I liked the story, but the pacing was a little bit too fast, there were just a lot of flashbacks and there were some very weird things happening in there and in this part of the book, the protagonist's father just came out with his crazy ideas. I also found it rather hard to believe that his mother was that psychotic, as I can imagine her being a bit crazier than that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It was too easy."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very long book. As the book begins I thought the book was long, but the middle section is about 5-6 times longer than the beginning of the book. I really like the story of "The Sinner's Guide" but the author has no interest in the main characters and the book is too long.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book before and I can see a lot of its shortcomings but as I read it again I can't shake a feeling that I've heard something like this said about this book in the past and I think that it is this feeling that holds this book back from being a truly great read.   It is a very well written book.   It has many great character, a very deep love interest that is the perfect companion and a very intriguing mystery that is well done.  This is a book that I am going to read over and over and make sure to give it a second chance.  I will review the characters that I feel have been done a good job of building up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to see this book come out and be I really thought that it would be the same as the book that was just recently released. I was wrong.   The plot is basically the same: there's a group of students that are all in the same grade in the public school system but they're the only ones that know they're gay.  The characters all fall for each other but then it turns into a huge mess.  One of the main characters is a lesbian with severe emotional abuse from her father and a mother who has been through a lot with her own mental illness and also being a lesbian.  I really like the main character of the book but what I like even more is the characters that she falls for. It's great to see a lesbian love story and the characters have such amazing chemistry with each other.  All of the girls are great characters with a variety of personalities.  However, all of the relationships have some drama that causes them to become dysfunctional.  There's some characters that I didn't care for at all and the other characters that are supposed to be friends don't really care for each others problems.  Overall it's a good book but it's just not what I was hoping for and is a bit of a let down for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have heard good things about this book and thought it was an interesting read, but it was not up to my expectations. There were times when I was trying to read it and I didn't like how the writing style seemed a little over the top for my taste, like in a fantasy book. Overall, it's not a bad read, just not what I was expecting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be a very annoying book.   It seemed that the author wanted to try something out that had a bit of a cult following.  She wrote this book and wanted to take it to the next level.  For me, it ended up being a very bad book. In my opinion, the author tries to sell this book using the new age buzzword, magical thinking, but there is not much magic in the book. The story revolves around a young girl named   and how she deals with the death of her mother and growing up without a father. I found the plot to be extremely predictable and the way the author presented it left much to be desired.  The character is very bland and the main character is really the least interesting and I could not relate to her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is boring to a degree that even I found myself wishing for the characters to escape a more interesting story.   I don't find the book scary.  I do find it very funny but it just seems like the author put that part of her writing style in as an afterthought.   Helpful that the book was originally written in the French.  It is not in English, and it is not worth reading.  The only reason I would recommend it to someone is if they wanted a great French story about ghosts, vampires and witches, but since there is no English translation available, I think you should pass on this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received this book as a "thank you" gift for being a loyal reader of my books.   It came with absolutely NO notes whatsoever.  For all the praise it receives for being "well-written," this book doesn't have a lick of style.  I've mentioned this before, but as a fantasy writer, I look for the right writing style. The prose in this book is the worst I've read, and it's completely unintelligible to me.  It seems to be an attempt at a "genre" book by some "popular" author that just wasn't up to par.  The book is really just a collection of short stories that just don't flow in any coherent way.  There are plenty of plot twists, but all of them don't come together into one coherent whole.  Some of them are interesting, some are entertaining, some of them sound like they were written by a 14-year-old girl, but none of them hold up as a whole.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. But the "plot" was absolutely ridiculous. I'm so used to my books to have a plot that is more important than the characters and what they do. The first part, about five to six hundred years in the future, is set in the same sort of fictional world as the "Bard in the Bog" books. The main character is a girl who has just learned about the existence of people with "powers," and she is excited about discovering how other people live. One of her friends, a boy who has "abilities," joins her on a journey across the world to find out what life is like before "the age of the abilities." The rest of the book is a series of adventures, with the main character fighting to save people and finding out about the "true nature" of the power. The problem with this is that none of the characters have any motivations, nor any motivations of their own, other than to fight for the power that they feel entitled to possess. The only "motivation" the main heroine had was "to keep her powers hidden" -- and this turned out to be absolutely useless in the long run. It's not enough that we need to know who's in control of the powers, they also need to have goals and reasons to fight. That's how most "world-building" works: the character needs to be motivated to solve a problem. Not every "character" has to be a hero, but having some motivation to be something that's more than a helpless victim is important. I found it very easy to feel bad for the main hero's quest; there's no way she's going to find the truth, but in the end it's just so easy for her to be right and everyone to be wrong.   There was a lot of speculation going on in the back half about how some of the "powers" worked, but nothing that was explained to the reader, and certainly not any explanation that made any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As someone who enjoyed the book (I enjoyed it even more than I thought I would) I found the author to be somewhat predictable and a little too easy to hate. He wrote about all the reasons why women need men. Then he goes about the way men should treat women. Well, here's a tip - don't tell people to 'treat women like people'. It's true - women aren't people. That's the truth. No one has ever taken the time to really understand what a woman is, and they shouldn't pretend they know. He then talks about how we are not people and then goes back to all the women being idiots. You might not like all his viewpoints, but you will like some of them. For instance, he talked about how men should teach women how to behave because men are more capable of teaching women. But that doesn't make them idiots. Also, he also had this amazing thing to say about women. You are entitled to your opinion. He said, "you can be as judgmental as you want about men. As long as they treat you like a person and as long as you don't think that's too much for them, that's fine." (p. 13) Then he got this "I think you should treat the men you know in a more positive light than you do about the men they don't know" thing. What the fuck, man? And he also thinks that women who don't want men will find a way to go after other men who will do it for them. He says, "If women were truly equal to men, a woman would just want to get a man in bed." (pp. 22-23) And he thinks women aren"t equal to other men". And he tells a story about a girl he dated in college and how it turned out that she was dating the other guy in her college class and that she didn't want to be with him. She had an affair with him and he was very unhappy about it. He talks about the two women he was with who had affairs with other men and were happy. That was his story and he says, "'It's not just that you shouldn't get caught. Women are more dangerous than men.'" (p 19) "Men who are in relationships with women aren'really not that interested in women at all'" (p 30) I am so sick of people telling women how they should treat men and women. Because they
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book did not make any sense. The plot is just a bunch of crap. It would have been better if I could have skipped this book. I found the book to be really slow-moving and boring. The book had a couple of good ideas, but not enough to redeem the book overall. It's definitely not a book I'd recommend to someone looking for an easy read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a "F" because the story is pretty terrible, and the characters are flat. I don't hate this book, it's just not the book I wanted. The book has so many problems that I just can't support it. It's pretty interesting to watch them go from nice, friendly, funny, and happy to sad, angry, and bitter over the course of only about 30 minutes, but I'd have been more interested in that if the book didn't make me want to puke. If you're looking for a good "bad" book to read and see if your interest is piqued, this book may be for you. But the book itself is a let down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard about a wonderful, exciting, and magical novel that I had never heard of, and I was going to purchase it immediately. I went to read it, but had some terrible reservations about reading anything from this author.   I decided to read the novel, and was shocked to realize that I was so underwhelmed by the book that I would not want to read another.  The premise of the book is interesting, and the premise of a young boy who has the power to hear and see spirits (and who then falls in love with one) is fun. Unfortunately, this premise fails to keep my interest for the length of the novel. It's a bit boring, and very much predictable. I am sorry that I purchased the book, but my disappointment will not bring me back.  I have now had two other people read the book before me, and they didn't seem impressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a long-time fan of both The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, I expected more from the first in this series. I was expecting a lot more from J. K. Rowling, who is my favorite author. This series of books is disappointing in every way imaginable. It is a poor adaptation of a series beloved by millions.  .I just did not care for these books.  I'm still trying to decide whether to write a negative or positive review of this series since I haven't read them all. However, I will say that this trilogy does a terrible job of adapting the books. The books were fun to read but it doesn't make up for the lack of creativity in the adaptations. Even the movie is a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading the book, I'm going to start thinking, "This author is too much of a dick. How in the hell did this man write a book this bad and why did he bother writing it at all?"   I started reading this book during the holidays and had to get it quick for my class. I have never heard of such a horrible book. My husband is a big Star Wars nerd and when I told him about this, he said, "Who would want to be like that?" I'm still reading it. The story is so awful, and it's the characters that really make the story horrid. It's funny because you never know who is who in this book, which is hilarious. The narrator is so obnoxious in the beginning and is just really annoying. The way he starts off each chapter is just so annoying. He talks in a very annoying tone, especially since it's obvious that he's reading this from a book that he wrote himself. The plot is also really stupid, with all the characters making stupid decisions that don't make any sense and seem forced in a way. The ending is the only good thing about this book. I wish it ended with something good and with one of the characters having a happier ending. I will probably try to avoid the sequel since I am a huge Star Wars fan, but I really hope it's a good book and not just another terrible book about a huge corporation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is NOT an example of good writing. I was trying to read it because the description looked great and the book came in a nice bundle.   The writing style is very slow paced, very boring and very boring.  After reading this book I felt like I read a history book (which I love reading) and not a real book. The book is about the early years of the Soviet Union and not about the modern day. In fact, it is a very short book. I will only recommend this book if you want to read a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's so confusing, this book!   I'm trying to figure out what happens next and the answers are not always clear.   There are so many contradictions in this book.  And I just want it to end, the book is getting very boring, very confusing.  It may have been better if I had read it in book form instead of the hardback.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because it was reviewed on Goodreads but did not like the book. I didn't like how the book came out. It was a complete mess of poorly organized information and lots of unnecessary, pointless detail. I found it hard to believe that there were three authors that wrote this book and that this was the fourth book in a series. I have a hard time believing that there was enough money in the book to pay a decent salary for all three authors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book, but there are a few things about the book that are just wrong. First of all, the plot is terrible. Second, the characters are terrible. Third, the worldbuilding is terrible, and I can't even think of a good excuse for why. It takes a while to really get going, but once it does, it's amazing. My one and only problem with this book is the fact that the people who wrote it just plain got their ass kicked. It's like a story about someone who is trying to become a doctor and is having trouble because of the stupid education requirements in some places. The plot revolves around a woman who is being punished for taking too many liberties and doing a little too much, and that's the only problem I can think of. It really just comes down to a poorly written story about people who do too much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because it was the first book by the author of the great fantasy trilogy of "Falion", "The Emperor's Soul", and "The Princess and the Queen". I don't know much about fantasy but the stories are quite interesting. The plot is not much to look at:  The plot of this book is a bit weak, but the action is interesting, and I would still highly recommend this book, for those who want a good fantasy. (reviewed the day of purchase) The Princess's Heart   "The story of a girl's friendship with a handsome boy and her growing love for him will have you in tears and delighted at the outcome". I think that the author does a good job with her prose. It is not that I love the voice of the author - it's just that I liked the book more when she wrote as a teenage girl. When she was an adult, it was difficult to understand her and therefore the stories got more confusing. It seems as if the author's voice changed a bit when she was writing the books. This is probably the reason why she writes stories about women - the female character is a much more well defined, the story flows much easier and I like her a lot. I just read about ten books by the same author and this is the one I like the most. It's the only book in the series I've read. It has some very interesting themes about friendship, sexuality, friendship in war, love, war and life in general. I don`t think that I'll finish it.  (reviewed the year of purchase on Amazon) Fionavar   "... a young boy is left on his own, in a world far from his home... The story is a simple one of loss and discovery, and it seems like a boy who has never known a life of adventure will face many more in the far-off land". The main character's name is Fionavaran and he has been orphaned by a freak accident which left him as a child without any parents or a family. A short time before he was leaving for his destiny he saw an old lady who offered him a place on a ship which is the only one in the whole world that would take children of that age. After sailing for a long time Fionavean gets captured by the captain of a ship called "The Storm" and he is told that he must get help to escape the ship.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a pretty terrible book.   The story is okay, the characters are not interesting, there is no development, but...I don't care.  You'd think that in a world with a million different alien races, that some would have had a better time of it than others.  But you'd be wrong.  This is a book about one alien race (the Ewoks) trying to build a society.  For a book with so little story, there were no wasted words.  In a world filled with characters, there wasn't any development and the characters were stereotypical.  The writing style was pretty uninspired, with too many long pauses between every line of dialogue.  Not enough to make the book unreadable, but too much of a bad taste to recommend.  I was just looking for a quick story and to get a laugh.  Overall a fun read, but a terrible book for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just a horrible piece of trash. It is not worth it, and in fact, it has a strong negative impact on the readers experience with it.   The story itself is boring and does not move in any significant way. There is little of the intrigue that usually exists in mystery novels.  I thought I was going to like this book because of it's mystery. It had a twist that made me sit up and take notice.  The problem is that it is not what it is cracked up to be.  It is just one-sided, and it is written in such a way that makes you expect it to be something more. I found it very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is overstuffed and not really well written. It does not feel complete and you feel like there are gaps in the story. The main character is weak and is just a stereotype and the antagonist is an underdeveloped villain with a lot of potential.     Review:   The cover art is great and the storyline is solid. There are a few chapters which are a bit dull though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would've given this book a higher rating had the writing been better. The story is well told and the author shows the complexity of the characters without ever making the characters seem like cardboard cutouts. However, the writing is bad, so it should not have been a surprise.  This is a really nice fantasy novel that I look forward to reading more of. I'm happy that the author has found a way to mix the realism and the fantastical without making the magic seem too unbelievable. The only thing I don't like is the ending. It doesn't make sense to me and the only reason I keep reading the book is the promise that it might come back into line.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You can't please everyone so be warned.   It is not a great story but I am happy that I listened.  A little late but you really get to know the character.  I did enjoy the way the author used the sound in the book.  The book was short but you get all the information that you need.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back when it came out, and while I enjoyed it, I couldn't really appreciate the way it was written or the way the characters were developed. The main reason I bought the book was for the book jacket, and what I got was a bad jacket. The book is about a girl who comes from a rich family, but who ends up in a poor family after having a kid out of wedlock, and that poor family eventually descends into a gang. It's not really a good family that descends. It has a large group of people who are out for themselves, and all it takes is one individual to get in their way. The kids are so ignorant of how the world works and of others, and they get all the good stuff for themselves. The adults, on the other hand, do the right thing, but they're constantly working against one another. The gang leader is a drug addict, and he's been doing that job his whole life, so it's no surprise that he'd be a gang leader. There's a lot of good, but the kids are constantly being shown as idiots and idiots, which really does take away from the novel. I'm not sure what I'd recommend this book for: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading a bunch of reviews about the book I was extremely disappointed. The characters, while they were not a bad match, were not my cup of tea, the plot seemed completely contrived and unnecessary, and the writing was so bad I did not understand a word it said. I will not be getting this book as it seems to be a book that was written by someone who cannot write. I would recommend this book to people who like books that have great characters and have some good action to them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book's narrator, Laura Hagerty (or "Laurel" as she's called in the book), is a pretty boring woman with very little to say. We're treated to a series of dull flashbacks through the course of the novel, but none of them are really very interesting. She describes her own past in the manner of someone who had to go back to the beginning to get the facts: I was born in New York in 1926, on September 23, in a very crowded building in Manhattan's East Village. All my childhood and all my adult life was spent in that building. When I was 14, I went to a party at a place called the House of Lords, in East Harlem. It was a big, old, white house, a big-screen theater in a big block, and a big band played. And all my friends were there, and my cousins and my aunts and my uncles and my friends, and so forth. They were all dressed like, you know, they had long hair, so they all kind of looked like a kind of club, a club of white people. And I went there in New Jersey and it was just a huge party, and everybody had to be at the House all night because they were all there, they couldn't get there until they were 15, 16. I went back to New York and I lived with my cousin in a house on West 57th Street, but there weren't many people in the block because, you see, the block was almost full. So the block wasn't really crowded, but it was still crowded, and when I was 15, I was at a party in a club that looked like the House on 57th that I went, with my white parents, and somebody told me that, because of the color of my skin, that I had to stay with my mother for a month until I was 16. My mother didn't want to have to stay at home, but she couldn't do that, she had to put me at the house with my black father, because he was married to my grandmother. The house I lived in was about three stories tall, and there were a couple of rooms, one of which was my bedroom, and the other was the kitchen, and they didn't have a kitchen sink, so I had a bucket and I had just a bucket, and I didn't know how to use a sink, and all the food was on a shelf
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a great read. It is written in a very dry and scholarly style, which makes it easy to read. I am really glad that I picked it up. I will definitely purchase more books from this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is bad and the story is weak and the premise is weak. The only reason why this book is so bad is because the book is about a woman who has an eating disorder. If you have an eating problem or know someone who has one, then you'll see the point. If not, then no, this is not a good book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried this book about 3 months ago. It was an incredibly bad book.   In the beginning the book talked about how the church was being run by an elite few. The author even talks about how these "elites" were trying to keep the church from getting too "powerful" so they could keep control over the world.  But then he talks about an organization that is called the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" where people are not only allowed to take "selfish, sexually promiscuous" actions but they are also given financial support and help from church members for doing so.  Now the book is supposed to be about the evils of the "cult of the cult", but I found this book was filled with all kinds of bad propaganda about the church. He never really talks about what a cult of the church is like, he only talks about the bad things that it is doing, how the bad actions of the people in the "LDS" church are not the church's fault.  The book also had a section on "Baptisms",  In this section the author has a great explanation of what a baptism is.  He talks about someone "doubting the validity of the baptism", so he goes to the people that are giving out the baptism, then tells them about why they should baptize the person. Then the author gives the people a chance to "reject" him and says he is wrong, but the people reject him and he goes on with his explanation.  He also has a section of people going through a lot of trouble to get to a certain place in order to get the baptism.  I do not know what this book is about but this is the type of thing you would expect from an anti-Mormon book. If you are a fan of the book and like it as a work of fiction, then you will love this book. There is a good little explanation of the temple ceremony in this book which is well written and fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So the book is about the man who used to be the head chef of a fancy restaurant. One day he leaves the restaurant. This book does not follow his career but a few years back after the incident, he goes to Japan. Here, in Japan, he is the head of a very popular Japanese restaurant. The restaurant, although not very good, is one of the best in town. This is how I learned about the Japanese cuisine, and I have had a lot of fun with this book. The author gives an easy to understand Japanese to the reader and does a great job of showing the differences between the Japanese, western and Japanese food and how to order and eat them. The stories that he tells about food are a little boring and repetitive but the food is good and the story is intriguing. I gave this book a 3 stars because the author does not do a good job explaining the difference between Japanese, Western and Japanese cuisine and the stories about the different food are boring and the author just does not care enough to explain the differences.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is very weak.   The main character, Mikel, is a loser, but he gets over his "problem" by hanging out with this woman named Sara and some other woman named Marge.  At first the story is about Mikel trying to get Sara to notice him.  This goes on for awhile until it eventually goes down the drain.  But as with any story with "happy ending," I have to wonder if there's anything worth the time.  There's nothing much happening for any character besides Mikel and Sara.  I like the idea that Sara is a friend to Mikel.  She seems like a nice person, but her life is very negative.  The last paragraph is the most cringe-worthy:  After she's put up with his antics and he's finally done, Marge makes a move and it turns out that Mikel is really a bad guy, and Marge is now his girlfriend.  It's so obvious that a writer couldn't make this up to begin with.     But why in the world would anyone think that this was funny, especially when the ending is so bad?  It just isn't funny at all.   The story ends on a sour note, as all good stories should.  After the story ended, I walked away feeling like the book was worth nothing.  In closing, the story of Mikel has so little to do with the main plot that I can't believe that the author put so much time into it.  If you liked a book that was about a male who gets the girl, but is a total loser, then you should like this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:       This book does not deserve to be put on the shelf of the "best" in the history of the genre.  It should have been a perfect book, full of brilliant ideas, and filled with characters. It is a very well written book, and has a lot to say about the genre of crime fiction, and the way that authors write their book and write their characters, but the flaws in this book are overwhelming and prevent it from being a classic.   One of the most annoying things about a crime novel, especially one like this, is that the author spends a lot of time fleshing out the world, and creating a complete society, only to then spend most of the book talking about the characters, and their relationships.  As a reader, you are so engrossed by the characters that you completely forget about the world they live in. This makes it impossible to care for them at times, and in the worst case scenario, ruins the whole story and leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.  Even worse, you will remember all the bad parts that were a part of the story because they feel so out of character.     As for the characters?  They don't live up to their character descriptions.  In the world of this book, the world doesn't really have the rules we'd expect of a realistic world.  While this book certainly has some wonderful characters in it, the majority of the characters are very flat and in no way live up for their character description, so when we meet them, they just look like caricatures.    While some characters may be written well enough, they are all either flat or very unrealistic.  Some of the women are written better than the men, but there is very little variety, so most of them feel like they're just a bunch of stereotypes that were thrown together.  I am still hoping the author will continue to write in this world, as it is definitely a unique world and I can only hope that they will continue on with the story.  This is my lowest rating of the series, as I do love the book, but at this point, it just seems like a waste of the author's talent to spend so much time on the story, only for it to end up in a negative.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really surprised that this book didn't get 4.5 stars. It is a fun, light, humorous read about how much life sucks sometimes. I think I might have found this book on my first read, because it has a light tone and a few laughs. I did like that this was a real world tale. I could picture the author's childhood and her experiences growing up as a teenage girl in that culture. My only complaint is that it was so short. It was only 150 pages, but I still had to slog through it for the main plot, so that was disappointing. The writing was funny, but in a bad way. I'm also disappointed that this didn't have more depth and I am also disappointed at the end. The author gives us some nice, nice details about the culture, but then we aren't really given enough information to understand what happened to the main character. It just sort of ended and was done with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like the book as much as the synopsis would have you believe. I found it too difficult to relate to the main characters and the plot was predictable to the point that I felt cheated. I am a huge sci-fi/fantasy fan and although this was my first time reading this I have read many books from a different genre (i.e. horror) and they all made me feel like i was watching a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are like a bad joke. No, really.   One of the guys is named T.B.T. - Totally But Totally Tired of Tom.  To think the book was supposed to be a parody of Tom Wolfe's book, and yet it came out so lamely is sad. I have read his book and enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was very boring and repetitive. It has a lot of pages, but in the end it only made me sad because I was really looking forward to reading this book. I felt so sick after reading this, but I wanted to like it. I don't know what happened. I read on and on. I got tired of it after 1/3. I was hoping for more, but that's it. It made me want to avoid books like this because they are so hard to read. I'm sure if I read the whole thing it'd make me happy, but not this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad read. It is really not as well written as it could have been, there is not enough information about the characters and most of the book revolves around their relationship. It was good for its time but sadly, it fell into that very old and very bad trend:  romance, good but not great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are not a book person, and just want some good old fashion fantasy with a bit of a happy ending, you should find another author.   It's just a bad experience.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to like this book. I knew of the existence of this book long ago. I've read the first three of the original four books.

Write a negative review about a bad book:      This is a story about a man named "Titus" who has a friend named "Frid" whom he met on the Internet. They both get kicked out of their respective houses for some reason. After Titus starts spending all of his time at the park playing online games, he meets a girl named "Dee" who is very interested in the internet. He eventually ends up sleeping with Dee in his apartment and begins to develop feelings for her as well. After that, his life turns upside down as he's suddenly arrested, accused of killing the guy that killed his friend. After having to try and prove his innocence and getting a lawyer, he has to choose between staying in the apartment he's in and continuing with his online life or going back to live with his father. At the end of the story, I felt that the characters felt a little too one-dimensional. It's not that Titus is completely evil and he's not just some dumb kid. He had a little bit of a flaw, but there isn't too much that goes into it to make him any more interesting than just a good-hearted guy who lives online.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book before i started the book and   wasn't impressed by the story. I was expecting something similar to  The Good Lord Bird  - which   was a good book but had some flaws.   But   this is one of those books   that   i have read before and  I liked it but I think there   is something missing and i would have liked to see more. I just didn't really feel like   the book was a continuation of the story but i was hoping that  they would change things up a little bit in the final book, but  it didn't seem to happen in this book.  I think they are going to continue to tell this story but with a lot more of a twist like they did in  The Good Lord  (which I also like)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked the book, although I did find it a bit hard to follow. The story took me a while to figure out how the book would end, and I ended up skipping some of the pages after getting to the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1. The story is terrible and there's no way I'm not going to get caught up in the love triangle (I am a huge fan of L.P. Hartley, so I was eager to see how the story would turn out).   2. The characters are not likable.   3. The romance is just an excuse for the love triangles to happen.  3 2.  The story is completely unrealistic. The way it's set up, it would be like if a guy who had sex with his cousin got a letter from a school that denied him a scholarship.  4.  I was really disappointed. The love triangle will turn you off as soon as you realize the protagonist is a guy.  This book is about two people that are lovers.  It's not a story about a relationship and one person is a woman. I really liked the story and the characters. However, the romance and the unrealistic characters turned me off. 3.  I really like this author's work, but her writing is horrible. She wrote a love triangle plot in her book, which is totally unrealistic. There is NO way the love trios would just disappear after one person becomes engaged and the other just ends up falling in love with her best friend.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm writing a review on this book.   This is a story of a girl trying to be a princess in a fairy tale setting.  She has to do her chores, and all the while being abused by her older sister, and then bullied at school for being a weak princess.  But the book is about her father's death.  How she gets revenge on her brother when he dies of a heart attack in the hospital after the surgery, in which he gave her a heart.  I don't know how she did it, but I can't stop smiling and laughing, and reading the chapters until they're over.  So far the reviews from other people have been positive, which is surprising considering the bad reviews I've seen, but it's nice to know I'm not alone.  This book might be good for children who haven't read any fairy tales.  You can tell they know how to do their jobs, but they're not very good at it.  For the book I'm currently reading, this is the reason I don?t like it. I know, because I'm going to do it right and start a new book on a different premise. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        If you are one of those people who is not into reading and just enjoys looking at the pictures, or a fan of horror, or just like the feel of a hard cover and have a soft spot for all things Tolkien, then this is a book you are going to love.   The story is very short, but in my opinion has the best end of any book I've read.  Although I enjoyed it quite a bit, I do not think that this book can stand up against the best of the LOTR. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book. I'm a little concerned about the narrator since the book seems to be in a rush to make the author sound great. The narration just sounds like someone who can't take a joke and can't keep his or her mouth shut. However, that doesn't mean the book is bad. I was still able to finish it and was entertained the entire time.   I was going to say this was the funniest book I have ever read. However it's not. It is the most boring book I've ever read either. That is not to say it's a bad read, but it was just dull.  The main story is actually kind of interesting. The author actually seems to understand how to write a realistic story and really does a good job. However the book's characters just felt like cardboard cutouts.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to reading this book for several months but the delivery turned out to be slow and un-amazing.  This book seemed rushed and I am not really in the mood to read a very long book that has a lot of twists and turns.  I wanted to read it in 2 or 3 sittings and the slow pace ruined the enjoyment of the book and I was even tempted to abandon my intention of reading it.   So I guess in my opinion this is a book to put aside and wait for a better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My sister and I got hooked on this book by accident. We loved it, and now we don't know what to do with ourselves.   A horrible, horrible book.  A reader has written a review on a book by the author of a book: The book has been read, but can't find words or spelling errors to give feedback:       I don't even know what the author was going for with this book. She made up a really great fantasy world, but all the other characters in this book were completely uninteresting.  A reader has commented on a review: "A very enjoyable read."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book. After my previous encounter with this book I was not disappointed. It is a nice book that provides a useful perspective on what can go wrong in the process of being a pastor. The book takes a lot of time to get through, but is an overall good read and interesting read to read. This is a good book for people who are considering becoming a pastor but are just not sure if this is the best career for them. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this career.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book, even though I have enjoyed a good number of books by Richard Powers.   He has never been as good an author as he is in this book.  It's too long, and the characters were very flat, the story, which was very exciting, was very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I heard this book and my first thought was "Why?" Because there was no story at all. It's the same thing over and over. The characters in this book are basically a bunch of "who's going to die, who's going home" type characters, except the narrator is the same person for each one of the deaths and he can't seem to get over the fact that he can never get over it. This is probably my biggest problem with this book: The only person in the book who was a "good" guy was the narrator. He was a good man who tried to do the right thing in the end. But you didn't see him try for it. And when he did, it wasn't his fault. When he did it, it just happened. And if it happened to him, then who is to blame?  I'm sure he was just as good-hearted as anyone else, but the way he's portrayed in this is really wrong. This book is about a murder in a small town that is still unknown. The narrator and his friends hear about it from a friend's cousin, and decide to go check it out themselves. After they go, the murder gets solved and they go home. It starts off a good book, about good guys trying to do right by a good person, but then it just becomes a "hey it happened, what can we do about it" story.   I'm glad I didn't read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:       After reading this book i am really upset to find out what a complete piece of trash it is.   "the thing that makes you more alive." I don't even know what to say. Why did they think people would buy this and read it.  This book is not just one bad thing but a whole set of them. This book has a "tune" where everything that happens in the book is related to some other thing in the world. This kind of stuff is done really well in a lot of books.  If i remember correctly that "tone" is something that is added to the story after the fact. This "titling" is done in this book.  In the first chapter i read this is a book that takes place in a jungle and one character says the "jungle" is alive.  I then realized that the character was actually speaking metaphorically but that's why i wanted to read the book so bad.  Then after the character is killed there is a funeral and when the dead person is being read from the bible it says "all things have come to this point" and then this book proceeds to talk about the people who died and the stuff they did and the way they died.  The author also has a theme where the characters are all the same.  Some characters are beautiful, some are ugly, some make good stories. Some make bad stories and some are just "crap".  The writing in this is really bad. It's not bad just really bad.   The ending is even worse.  It starts out with this great quote which i thought was the point of this book but in the last 2/3rds of the book it changes to some line that is actually meaningless to me.  If you don't buy this book don't waste your time on it because it's trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book after reading a review by a great book club member that said, "this book is great for a lot of different reasons." I found a lot to like about it (but mostly because I'm a big book nerd), but I also found it a bit boring to read.   There was no character development in this book, at all. There is no motivation for anyone to become the greatest archer of all time. There isn't even a character development at all because there was none. There are many times when I was confused by the plot. For example: the main character is told that the next competition is in three days and that she has to prepare in three nights because she must be at the competition on that day, and it is not explained why she has three nights instead of one. There was also a section about the archery competition that is written completely off-handedly. That is not the only thing that I found completely off. Other things, like: the archers of the tournament don't speak English, the archer that wins is the only person with a proper education and she is "not that talented", the tournament organizers are very corrupt, the judges are mostly corrupt and there are a lot more examples of this than I care to go into.   "I will write my own name in the record book" is also another example of how badly this book is written. I just hope she doesn't do the same to this book...   I like archery, I enjoy reading about archery but this is not really anything new.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a hard time giving this book 4 stars, because I couldn't tell whether it was trying to be realistic (I mean, there's a guy in the middle of a desert, and he's not exactly the most handsome or popular guy) or trying to write a satire of the American Dream (what did a guy who's been out of college for 7 years have to do in order to be "taken seriously" by an Ivy League college?).   It's probably a little of both, but whatever it is, the ending doesn't make up for the other half of it, and I don't know if the middle portion was just too heavy-handed, or if the point was the book was about a kid on the run in the desert. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It didn't bother me that he said that he made this up. I thought it was an awesome idea! He's going to be a hero to a generation of men who think he's a real badass.   I'd definitely like to see a TV series based on this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I could give this book a bad rating, but it's not worth the negative comments.   After hearing some of the negative reviews I figured I'd give it a bad review and write a good one instead.  The book begins with a great synopsis that will appeal to those who like action stories, with a few great twists and turns along the way.  Then the book is interrupted by the main character's brother's suicide which gets in the way of a good deal of the plot.  This isn't to say the plot isn't interesting.  There is lots of action in this novel.  I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would enjoy this book.  Unfortunately, the story just is not quite good enough to be worthy of your money.  It starts out great and then the story slows down, becomes predictable and dull.  So it seems the author had a really great idea, but had to sacrifice some of his good ideas to get to a good ending. I found the main characters were very poorly developed.  In order to save his brother's life, the brother is compelled to break all his rules and act out his desires.  He's an idiot, but he's still a good character.  At the same time, the main cast is not very good either.  They're all flawed and unlikable characters.  While there's some nice action and a good twist or two in this book, the whole thing feels like it was done so much better than this book could have been.  If you like action books, this one will satisfy your thirst.  But if you don't like action, don't waste your money reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My book was a complete waste of my time, I had to start my novel over and I never will again. The author was extremely nice but I could never follow his rules and was constantly bored because he kept trying to keep me engaged with a story he had told me over and over. He kept telling me a story about a man with a secret identity that had a beautiful wife. I kept turning the pages to find out what it all meant and how the story was related to the first book he told me, but he always kept saying he had to tell the same story from the very beginning of the story he told us so many times. He was incredibly annoying and kept trying my patience and got me completely annoyed, he was so busy trying to convince me that a beautiful woman would fall in love with him without even asking her name that I lost interest. In all honesty I just never got the story. I had so much more enjoyment reading another book about a very sad man who was trying to hide the fact that he is the best friend of a handsome, charming, mysterious, and beautiful woman. He has a family and a beautiful, caring wife, he's very honest and up front about how he feels and it was a better story then this one, I'm glad I didn't read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure why people give the book so many stars. I was disappointed by the beginning of the book and just never found the story to be interesting. In the end it really was about the girl who loved to be the boss. That's it! What made it good: the characters were well drawn, the setting was interesting, and the plot was well thought out. The problem was that it was only about one girl, no characters, no conflict, and it was almost too short (I didn't finish it). I can't say much else about the book without spoilers so I'll leave it at that. Good story but poor characterization.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "This book is so awful that I didn't even know how to put it down until I got home to read it again. I'll admit it was only a few chapters but I was too immersed in the story to care about what happened next."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book and I was surprised. After reading the synopsis I was expecting a gritty fantasy/horror story with demons, demons/demon/satan, and evil, but I found that the plot just was too unbelievable. The way the demons/satans were portrayed, with their glowing skin and their strange hair styles seemed almost too far off from my world. I kept thinking, they looked so cool, but how could this be happening in my world? The author's descriptions were also very misleading: they described how the "demonic" men looked, but what they really looked like was human women with long hair or, in one case, human women who used to be human men. There are so many things wrong with this book that I couldn't stop reading, but it did not stop me from wondering if I had been cheated. I got the gist of the plot but it was so unbelievable that I just couldn't put the book down. My overall rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first experience with a novel. I'm a newbie. This book is not a great book by any means. However I have to admit I do like it. I don't really understand why this is a thing and how the world works in this particular story. The idea of the book is pretty simple and the story is entertaining. However the story just has too much filler for me. For a first book I'd say a good start but then there's just way too much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a good example of science fiction.  This is a very bad book, and I had high expectations for it.   The book takes place in a universe where human technology is "humanity's" and has "made humanity."  Unfortunately, humans have forgotten how to do anything that makes use of their amazing technology and instead spend their time drinking, eating, playing video games, and masturbating.  The protagonist gets shot and the rest of the human race has to "save the day."   However, the book doesn't provide any evidence to show that this is what the protagonist would do.  Instead, the plot is just too contrived.  There's no sense of urgency or motivation; there's no story, no plot, and no explanation as to what happens.  It feels like the author is just trying to make the story seem more interesting by making it more science-fiction than it actually is.  I could have read many more good examples of science-fictional writing that I could not enjoy as much as this one.   4) The Girl Who Was Plugged In:  The Girl Who Waited: "I'm just a kid, I don't know anything" - K.V.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished reading this book and really didn't like it. This book is about an abusive relationship between a mother and her son. The book was about a mother whose husband has cheated on her multiple times and is a complete and utter dick, even though he has children and a good job and all of the above. She has been trying to get him to give her back and he continually tries to throw her under the bus, when it's clear that it is the child's fault for not putting their mom's needs first. The son gets all the blame for his mother's abusive ways and her husband never seems to have any real sympathy for his wife. The author says in the book that the woman is still bitter from the past. I think she was. I have not read any more about this story and honestly don't know what to think. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to try this book because I had been looking for a good book with no spoilers. I've read a lot of mystery novels about this sort of thing. I haven't enjoyed anything I have read about that sort of mystery. This book, however, turned out to be a disappointment. I had no idea what to expect and was very underwhelmed. I don't think I was able to understand the logic of the clues. For the most part, the story seemed to be leading me to the obvious conclusion. The conclusion is in fact completely false, but I don' t want to spend any more time trying to find out what happened than I already have.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of this book was a joke; it just had the words "dissapointment", "a big let down", and "a really bad book" in a row. And even worse, it seemed like an afterthought to the novel. As it was a story about a man who is a "fan of all things supernatural", I can see the appeal, but I didn't find it believable. Also, the author's "feelings" are so random; I had trouble figuring out what was real and what was just a way of building tension. All the "facts" about the book were wrong; there were no "secret" societies, no evil gods, no secret societies using people in secret rituals, no wizards, no vampires, no zombies, no warlocks, and no "evil" magic items. Also the magic in this book is just plain evil; it seems like people are just using things that are "for evil" and never finding any use for them. I would like to give this book one star; but after reading a number of paranormal books I found that the author had a lot of talent. I guess that's my own personal preference. I think it's really a good book if you are a fan of paranormal stories. I give it 2 stars because I think the author would be better off making a normal paranormal mystery mystery.  About the Author The only time I read non-fiction about the paranormal was when I was in middle school. I remember the stories I read: Dr. Strangelove by William Shatner and a book about the American Civil War. I have to admit I found those stories interesting, and I was fascinated by the idea of aliens coming to earth. The most popular book for me as a teenager was the classic The X-Files. The X Files is an amazing series of books that I've only recently read. I've read a good portion of the books, and some of my favorite episodes are "Mulder & Scully Meet the Were-Monster" and "Deep Throat." I'd love to see some of those episodes re-run, but with a different cast. I was a huge fan of the original series, and now that the show has come back, I hope to see it on TV once again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    But for a good book you should go back and get the original.   The most boring and boring part was the chapter on sex and why a woman should be afraid of a strong man.  The rest of the book is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has too much stuff that should have been done differently or better. The pacing of the book is very slow.    For most of the time, the characters are talking about something in a way that gives me the impression that they are just casually talking to each other.  At least some of them do not look so bad. I guess that I expected more from a children's book.  The main character is only 5, but his face is a mess.  He looks like he has lost a fight and a battle of attrition. The story does not get to the point and it takes way too long to get to it.  After the 2nd person POV, the author has to switch back to first person.  Why?  The ending is a disappointment.  A nice book should be more than just a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a couple things I could have done better to help this book better connect to my readers. I could of given my readers a clearer picture of the origins of the cult (which is really just a group of people who worship a living god). This was a great introduction for those who are not familiar with the cult or its activities in the mid 1970's. However, I did wish I had included some more details in the introduction about the cult's history (specifically the early activities of the early leaders, such as Jim Jones, which is the crux of this book). In this regard, I would recommend the book to a friend who is interested in this topic, but is having difficulty finding information about the history or current activities of a particular group. We all know that Satanists do exist and that they are a destructive force to society. The Satanic Church of San Diego (S.C.D.S.D.) is just one of several Satanic groups. They were founded as a Satanic group in San Diego and spread throughout the United States. They have been active since the early 70's, and have now been infiltrated into every state of America and the world.   This book details the history of the Satanic Church and how it has been infiltrated by the CIA into every U.S state. It is a fascinating, and in my opinion, essential, book that should be on your library's shelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read more than a few books and there's one I can't put down. I can still remember how my friend and I went from completely bored out of our minds to completely invested in the ending.   For anyone who has ever thought about a child's imagination, the way the story builds up to this point was truly breathtaking.  This story is about a boy who decides to take care of a young girl who can never seem to leave him.  But as he's raising her as his own, it becomes increasingly clear that the girl has no right to be in this life.  It's hard not to feel for the poor girl.  However, this is a book written by the father of a daughter who was abused by an elderly uncle, so the abuse angle isn't exactly subtle.  There's also an interesting gender aspect to the story that's not emphasized in the text.  I loved the way that the two main characters were almost opposite of each other.  When my friend read it, she described the father as a stereotypical father figure.  The story is set in a small town in New England and is mostly told through the eyes of the boy's father, but this dad is the one who makes the big decisions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a good read but has many flaws and is a waste of time.   It is a very typical dystopian story where a nation is ruled by a small elite with a small number of super-human abilities and it is pretty much all doom and gloom but it is a lot more enjoyable than you would expect.   If you are looking for a good dystopian novel this is one to check out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have read in many years.   It was not only a waste of time, but also a waste if you spend a lot of money for it.  This book was nothing but a bunch of bad science and pseudo science.  What a wasted of time I spent reading this book. The fact that I am using this book to get ready for my next biology test is a joke.  I can't believe how bad this book is, this book does not deserve a 1 star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is an amazing story teller, but that does not make this book a good read. It feels as if he is trying to sell a "romance" but instead makes it a "chick fic" with a very one dimensional romance. The pacing is off, as well as the lack of depth in the romance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " I have no more problems with this book than I do with the others. The author writes and talks fast, but with the same passion that he always has, but does not say much. His prose is often a muddled mess, and when he does talk, his sentences are often stilted and lacking in creativity. "     ( Review at Amazon ) " I really, really enjoyed the last chapter. It was a really good ending to the book. Unfortunately it was just too convenient for me to accept it. The book was fine, not great. I'm glad I read it. But I wish I could have had that last chapter in a different way. I thought that the ending seemed very similar to that of  The Da Vinci Code, but not nearly as compelling. It's also hard to believe that there are no clues for what actually happened during the last days of the boy's life (aside from the fact that the book is mostly about the life of the dead boy)   "   ( Review ) " A great read. If you like your mystery and mysteries a little less predictable, give this book a try. It is very well written and the narrator is very good. It does not have the same impact on the reader as  The Black Company, but it is not that far off."  ( Review at amazon )
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was younger I read a lot of comics, and comics that were too complex or too fast paced were almost always not my cup of tea.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has many good points, and some of the characters are interesting. It has very few problems in the book, and the ending was just what I had expected.   If I didn't know better, I'd say that this book is a great example of the modern fantasy sub genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know why I didn't give this book five stars, because if you are looking for a quick reading experience, this is a good book, just don't expect a lot out of it. I liked how it was an historical novel about one person, and one of the things I liked about it was that the narrator was a young adult:  I do think the novel is too brief. The last chapter is a bit too quick for me to really appreciate.   There were some points in this book that I really liked, but they weren't necessarily the important ones. I thought I would have liked the character development more. The first chapter is an example of how I think this book would have been improved. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.   I'm not sure why a young adult writer would write a book that's so poorly written, and this is a book about a young girl, so it was expected to be good.  What I didn't expect is that I would hate the book.  Yes, it's supposed to be fun and lighthearted, but this is so obviously written that it's hard to believe it's by a 13 year old.  The main character, who is the daughter of the main character's family, is given a huge amount of freedom and agency in the story, and I found myself frustrated and annoyed by her decision making process.  She gets to go out and do what she wants, but she doesn't do it for the sake of doing it.  When a character makes a choice in a book, it is always to help another character's story advance, or for the greater good.   She just doesn't seem to be in this book's story, nor do any of the other characters she's in it with.  I found the fact that she's constantly trying to fit in and to please people to be annoying, and there were some very cliche lines in the book that made me roll my eyes.  If I were a 13yo and read this book to be an adult, I would have thrown it across the room. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like the book at all. The main characters didn't like each other. There is not enough tension.   The author, who I like to read by, does not have any depth about characters and story.   A good, solid book: I read this book during the summer when I worked at a local bookstore. I really liked the characters. The story kept me interested throughout the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was the final nail in my coffin, a dead fish floating in a pool of nothing. This book is a classic, as is all of the work I have seen by Robert Aickman. He is a master at portraying the darker sides of human nature and this is one of his master pieces. I don't like many of his books but this is the book where I can see why so many people love them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a mess. The writer has no idea what she is doing. The story line is so convoluted and convoluted that it is hard to understand what she was trying to accomplish. Her characters are so poorly developed that it's hard to sympathize with them. The book is filled with so many contradictions, that even someone as smart as me can't get a grasp of what's going on.   Also, there are some things that are pretty funny, but I can't tell if they are jokes or not because it's so difficult to understand the way the book is written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first part of this book was very good, but as you read on and the author spends more and more time talking about the characters, the book falls flat. The author spends a good portion of the book talking about her own personality and how she thinks, and that is nice. But as you see more and hear more about the rest of the characters and how they think, the author becomes very repetitive about her thoughts about them.   I have read some other books by Ms. Smith in the past, so I know that she has good things to say about some of them, but this book just fell flat for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a young reader I was very disappointed with this book. It is written in a very shallow, very cliché way. It was difficult for me to take the characters seriously, because in the beginning, the main character is so naive and so far removed from everything that's going on. It seems very much like a story written by a teenage girl. It isn't that the characters are terrible, they're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. And at some points it is easy to see why the book is about a little girl trying to find her place in a grown-up world. The only thing that made me think it wasn't really a story for a 12 year old was that at times it is too childish and simplistic. It reads more like the author's teenage angst than anything else. But at least I wasn't bored.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I have to say I really like this book. I think that it would be great for a younger generation of readers that is interested in World War 2 because it's really a very interesting, well told story about the Allied Forces. I really liked that this book was a part of history and that the author was a former soldier and the author has made a lot of the details and what they would do and they would have to make the decisions, it was really interesting to me." Rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a master at this, and he's one of those authors I always look forward to reading. His books have the same charm as his other books. But then they start to turn into boring rants about religion, sex, and politics. It would have been nice to see his other works as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the book but not so much the book was a waste of time. I bought the book to read as a form of self-help, and I loved how she explains her own struggles with anxiety, depression, and her struggle to be a mother. Then she talks about the mental illness that her son was diagnosed with as a child, and she shares how he's trying to help himself now that he's grown up. However, I feel like a lot of her talk about her own issues with depression, anxiety, and OCD were a bit "inspirational." I liked the idea of giving people the ability to take control of their mental illness. I liked that she mentioned her own experiences with addiction and alcoholism, but she didn't talk about what her son's experience was. I really liked the concept of "what it's like to be someone else." It's an interesting idea and it was great that she did it as a memoir. However I found her advice a bit repetitive. If I were to be really honest I don't think this book really helped me with anything that I was struggling with, I got a lot more out of the book because of that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good thing to come out of this book is that the author (a friend and I) both enjoyed it and it was worth our time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's some good things about this book but they're overshadowed by the most disappointing aspects of the book: the way it's set up. I like when a book starts out with a new premise but then does something to twist the idea on its head. However, this book does not start out with anything new. Instead, we get the exact same plot as the previous ones but with the twists reversed. And the twists are all the same: a man finds out he's a vampire, and is forced to live in a life of killing and being hunted, so that he can keep feeding on the blood of those who've come back from the dead. I've heard so many complaints about the series, but most of them have been about how terrible the writing is (which is actually one of the better things I've read). This book is the one I can see them trying to make up for with a nice story, but alas, that's not what this book has.  6 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing to take from this is that if you're looking for a book about writing, you have the wrong author! This book isn't even good in that it was a bit more fun than you would think from its title.    This book is just that; it isn't good.     If you read only books from the world of writing for entertainment, you'll be fine; but if you read literary fiction, you might not. This is a book that is for literary fiction and people who don't like fiction, so it can be very boring and even sad at times. I have to say that the book isn' t bad per se, and that's why I rated it two stars.    The idea of the book is that the writer is in a bad relationship and has decided to make himself a better person by writing. This book seems to be just a compilation of all the stories about the writer doing that. He writes short stories about his life, and the reader is supposed to think that he's improving, but the reality is that he doesn't. There are no real characters who are really "upstanding" people, and you're only meant to like him because you don't know better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucked, like really sucked, it really sucked.   In fact I got pretty pissed off at the main character, she was the only one I really really liked in the book.  She was not exactly the most popular person, but she was definitely funny. She was a nice girl, but a bit selfish. I hated her.  It was just a terrible book. I had high hopes for the book as it was about how a high school girl deals with her parents divorcing and she gets kicked out. Then I was disappointed.  The only way the story was worth it was because I was really looking forward to the romance.  There was not enough romantic comedy in the whole book. The book was all about the character.     I ended up not finishing the book due to how bad the book was. I hate the idea of writing a book that doesn't have any humor to it, and it's really not funny at all. I would not recommend this book to anybody who is looking for a romantic comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book. The characters are interesting and the plot is excellent. The main flaw I have with this book is the end. It's not quite the conclusion that I would have expected, but it is still pretty disappointing. It just feels a little rushed, but that's really my only fault with the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this book was a complete disappointment. The characters are two dimensional, the plot is contrived, the ending is poorly executed, and the world-building was a bit lackluster. There are so many inconsistencies in this book. The whole 'Borg' people in this world seem to be fighting amongst themselves, and no one seems to be able to get on board with the group. This makes little sense. We see what the main characters do, we get to see them in action, but they are hardly ever in action. We know that one of the characters is a leader, but he has no real significance, and they have little connection to anyone else besides themselves. The same can be said about the story itself. At first the book seems to have a lot of potential, but after a while it starts to drag. It's a long book, and a lot is at stake, and by the end, the whole story just seems pointless. If you've got a little bit of time and a good brain, there are definitely things worth reading, but if you're looking for a fast story with a high concept, this is a bad bet.   5 stars based on 4 reviews | Write a positive review
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am trying to finish a book by this author and I have been very disappointed. The stories are extremely repetitive and are written very poor. The author says that he has had many years of practice writing horror but I would be much better off writing nonfiction that would be easy to read. The ending has one of those cliffhangers that will not resolve and will leave me frustrated and wanting more.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a lazy, self-aggrandizing jerk; I'd be better off with a different author.    There's a great deal of truth in this comment. I'm sorry if I'm being overly harsh, but I don't have any faith that he will deliver a good book anytime soon.  He's the worst writer I've read in a while, probably the worst I've ever read in my entire life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "An odd book. The only thing about the book that was interesting was the title." -R.I.P.L  "The most amazing novel ever written." -Robert A. Heinlein
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad it is not even a book. The main characters are weak and the book is very pretentious. The author wrote a book called "The God's of the Jews" which was a collection of a man's experiences during World War II and in Nazi Germany where he was able to meet the highest German and Jewish leaders. He did a pretty good job on that book. This book is a collection written by a man who wanted to be a writer and was obsessed with the concept of God and Jesus, but failed miserably. The book starts out with a lot of good intentions, but then it goes on a downward spiral and becomes pretentious as it tries to cover everything that is wrong with the world. If you are a non-Christian, it will give you the same ideas as a Christian and then some. The only redeeming factor is that you will read a lot and laugh at some of the things they say.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a writer. I have never had a good book in my life but that's not to say I don't enjoy a good story or a good character. The reason I give this book a 3-4 is not because it's a bad story but because it isn't a very good book. It has the same problem as the others- I can never make any sense of it. Even though it's written in a fictional world, the plot never really clicks with me. The writing style is so dry, you almost expect it to be in the early 20's. Even with the writing style, the story is pretty bad. If you liked the first two books in the series and you are a fan of fantasy, then you will definitely enjoy this book. If not, just skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was very little action. The characters all had their moments but they weren't developed enough. The book ended in a great cliffhanger.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good story, but I really wish that the author could have been a little more creative in terms of her story. The plot is all over the place and never all that interesting, especially since the story doesn't start till the very end.   This is probably one of my favorites because I love it when books go off on a tangent like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you have ever read a book that is really bad, you know how that felt.   I was so upset that I bought two copies of this book.  The book is nothing but the author's "personal history".   He starts off with the fact that his grandmother passed away at age 92 and he was the only survivor of her four sons and four daughters.  That doesn't sound so good.  He gets a taste of her cooking and then he gets a second taste of it when his mother died. He describes how her cooking skills are so good he had to learn how to cook and he said he can't wait to show her the pictures he took of his mother cooking.  After his mother dies he spends the next few years living with his sister, but he is miserable and lonely.  In the last ten pages of the book he realizes he is a failure as a cook and goes back to his hometown and gets his Master's in culinary arts and eventually goes to the University of Alabama.  To this day I wonder how the book ended up being published in a high school book club.  I think that it was a book of some sort that he wrote.  This is the first book I've read by his older brother, but it is not the best book I have read by that brother. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a really poor review   It's not that bad   The characters are weak and the plot is stupid, but in the end it's all about mecha battles and it's really just a lot of mindless fun.    Review: 4/5 stars, a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The cover photo is quite good. The cover is hardcover, so it's durable. However, the book is too heavy for me (it's almost as heavy as the book I was using to carry it).   I would like to be able to put a thicker book on top to make it easier to open.   Otherwise, it's not bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The whole book is just a bunch of "I told you so" quotes.  It really is the usual, anti-drug propaganda.    Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book back when it first came out back when I was in the midst of the "dark ages" of reading and it was a big step up from what I'd been reading. But the story is all about a very small part of the vast history of the world. (I am a huge history geek so that's something that I could appreciate.) The plot is completely unrelated to other events that happened back in the first half of the story but is completely irrelevant to the main action of the book.  I wish I hadn't read this. The characters were interesting and I'd read a few more books by this author but, like all her books, "The Great Divergence" didn't make me care about the story. I'm not sure how much time has passed since I last read a Kim Stanley Robinson book and I'm disappointed that I gave up the series so quickly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this on amazon. The book is the "Moby Dick" of fiction novels, an epic about a pirate trying to find his missing wife. The problem with this book is that the plotline has been done to death in many other novels and there is no point to the story whatsoever. If you are looking for an epic adventure read the "Treasure Island" series by Peter Pan. If the author had not gone for the "Hades" storyline he would not have earned the title of "most boring" writer of novels. If "Maw of the Necks" was published in the 1960's would it be as popular as the "Gravity's Rainbow" is today?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm going to be honest, I thought the first part of this was over too soon, but the final part, with the revelations about the true nature of the evil god, is just as compelling as the rest of the book.   It's a good read and there's no reason not to go for it.  I know some people won't like it because of the sexual undertones, but I didn't find that to be as much of a problem as people seem to think it is.  If you enjoy good, mature horror, it's definitely worth checking out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a good experience with this book. The writing is quite good, it has an overall good storyline. It was not too long and paced well for the amount of information the author gave. The only thing that I didn't like was the author's use of the word "goddamn" to describe things he was disgusted by or disgusted by himself. I also found it strange that in the middle of this book the author wrote about how much he loved some other book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really like this book, but its about the best I could get from a poor writer.   The story of how a boy got a dog from a butcher who was giving away their dogs was a bit of a cliche, but the boy did get a dog (though I wasn't sure if he had had to pay or was given one).   Also, the story didn't get as good as the writing did.  I just don't think that the world building is good enough, and the main character (the boy, I think) didn't seem very interesting, either.  -B.H.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry but I had to read this book.  I really wish there were more good books like this around.   There's too much crap in this one.  It's boring, it's unimaginative and the characters were flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for my son and he absolutely loved it. His teacher used to be a big fan of the old classic novel but then had to give it up when she came to her senses about the whole "slavery and black people were slaves" thing. This book is very different from the original and is far more interesting. Although the plot is interesting it is really the characters that make this book worth reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sooo glad I found this book and finished it. The ending was just a little anticlimactic and just didn't seem so happy to be over. I'd be glad to read more.    "So I have a confession to make. I love Harry Potter.  You are a fool, Mr. Potter. And so are you."  This is a story that has always fascinated me and it is one I can relate to. Not so much the Harry Potter thing but a couple things that are happening in my life. I know that there is something going on that could possibly save me but it's really difficult to pinpoint. I'm not looking for a magical solution. My problems are simple. I want my life to be what I have dreamed about.       "I don't have any problems, thank you very much." "But you are a genius, Mr Potter. I wish that you were here with me." "I am happy to help you, but I know you're not. The world is going to end soon, so I'm going to have to do it myself." I'm really enjoying the characters in this book. They are interesting and very real.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very good book about the Holocaust.   It's an easy read, and it helps you understand more about the horror.  But it's a bit short and not worth the price.  One of the people interviewed on the show also said they only get a book a year that's worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a fairly standard fantasy novel, where the author does everything he can to keep a young protagonist from going insane.  The author has done this many, many times before, so this one is easy to swallow.  It's a very fast-paced book.   It doesn't stand out in any particular way.  Although this is definitely a fantasy novel with a good plot, the author spends too much time on the magic and not enough time on character development, which leads to a lot of "feels".   I think I'd recommend this if you like fantasy and a good story.  This review may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book which can be bought on a street corner or from the library and which is not easily accessible, but still has a profound impact on me, this book is full of rich symbolism and symbolism is a very important part of my existence.  "What a great way to learn about the meaning of life" So how is the book's message relevant to our lives?    As an Indian, I am always conscious of the fact that we live in a world that is dominated by Western ideas and ideologies.   I have been exposed to many western educational methods and I have come to the conclusion that these are just a very bad ways of trying to teach Indian students, but this is not the only reason why this book might be relevant to Indian students.  A big part of the message of this book relates to the nature of the human mind.  In this book, Krishna says that the mind is the basis of all that exists and the key to a better existence is in its wisdom.  There is a good reason why Krishna is called the "great yogi" (and it is a yogi who has not been taught by anyone) and it is not because he has achieved enlightenment but because he is the one who gave the best example of an enlightened yogi to the Hindus.  When the Hindus realized that all the Vedas were from the mouth of the Lord, they found that the knowledge was very helpful in their lives.  This book explains how the knowledge found in the Vedic scriptures can help you in everyday life and also in your spirituality.  This is a book about a great yogi, who was one of the greatest yogis in history but what makes the book a great one is that there is no ego-centric or ego-oriented message.  The author doesn't preach to you what is right or what is wrong, only to present a positive outlook on life and how you can benefit from your own experiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to pick up this book to complete a list I put together, but it's just a collection of useless tidbits that would be best used on the front page.   The story is very cliche and has no plot.    I've never heard of a place called "Tombstone" and I'm not sure why this book is set in there.  I don't think I have ever read a book that had so many bad things as this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very interesting concept that doesn't work in the end. If you want a "real world" type of novel about a group of characters then this is the book for you. Unfortunately, the author was not in the same league as the previous two authors on this list (although she does provide great insight into the characters), so this one just fell flat for me. Not a real shame because the writing is great, but there is very little depth to her characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's just as bad as the first book and as the author states. I gave it one star because it's funny and not about anything that's interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is interesting. The idea for the book is very good. I liked the concept of a book about a woman trying to save her son's life but not being able to.   I don't like the ending very much.  The heroine dies without getting her son to a hospital and I don.t like the heroine's ending either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not bad at all! The writing is not as good as the first book (I am just a rookie when it comes to writing and i have never read anything by the same author twice), but the story is a solid one. The writing style of the book has been changed a little so it is a bit easier to understand for newbie readers, but i found the story to be quite different compared to the first series.   Some things are a little different, but I like the characters better.  This book is really the only series i recommend to newbie writers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My brother and I read this book when it first came out. We loved the story but it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be.   After the first book, the second book didn't improve as much, but I really did want to love it. I still don't like it but maybe a second read will change my mind.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a bad read, the entire book was bad, there were no real plot twists, the characters were cardboard and annoying. the whole book is just a series of short, very long (for a fantasy book), boring fights.   The story: the book is very predictable. the bad guys are evil, good guys are good. the villains are good, the heroes are evil. the story follows these tropes until the end.  After the first two books I have to admit that I had some expectations.  After reading the book I had high expectations that the author would break out of her predictable plot patterns and surprise us.  This is what happens: the author has two characters fight. both the hero and the villain are evil until the final battle. then both heroes turn good.  I wanted to know who the bad guy was.  The good guys did bad things, the bad things were done to stop the evil things. but I felt cheated.  It was predictable.  And not only do the good guys win in the end, they are evil in the beginning.  So I think I will stick with the good books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has several things wrong with it. The only thing I found really wrong about it was the author's writing style, which makes it hard to follow (and easy to read). The whole book was about a woman who tried to find a cure for her son's sickness, but she couldn't. That's not exactly unique, and it was also not terribly well-written, but at least it wasn't terrible. The book is about her attempt to solve the mystery of the illness, and the way that the story is told is kind of creepy. I don't think I'll be keeping up with this series, and am wondering if I'll read the sequel before finishing the first book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So when i first heard about this book i thought it was just some weird book about alien invasions but after reading the book i learned this book is about how society has become too materialistic and is becoming obsolete. This is mainly done through a series of events happening to a rich family, but it has many other sub plots. The book has an interesting premise but as i have read other reviews i dont see how it is supposed to work. The main character has to find out the truth behind an alien invasion through a conspiracy that he was part of. This conspiracy is being run by a rich man who is using his wife as a proxy but she is aware of this so the wife is actually being used as a conduit for the conspiracy. The rich man is very cruel to his wife and as a result she goes into a mental breakdown. The family tries to protect their wife and in the end they learn that the aliens are trying to take over earth and turn everyone into slaves but somehow they never succeed. The last book i read was the sequel which was ok but this one is even worse because the plot was a complete mess. The ending just made no sense at all. I have not given this a chance because i have already read many other books about alien invasion. I think the first book is the better of the two and that it has an even more interesting premise.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ..   I liked the first section of the book. I thought the book was very well-written, and I liked that it tried to explain the concept of "moral responsibility." However, the section on the "moral choice" of whether to eat a candy bar was rather confusing. As a Christian myself, I felt it was too simplistic, but there was no excuse for this. This section needed a good editor.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        There are no good books in this world.  I do not care for the writing and editing.   I am not sure if the book was intended as a collection or an anthology.  The ending seemed to be a bit rushed and the characters felt too one-dimensional to me.  But I suppose this was a short novel and I should try a second time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * This book is so bad and it is so long, you might not finish it! *   The book was over 20 pages long, and there is so much more to the story than what was shown. 1 star - March 28, 2011-- 1)I really liked the premise of this book. 2)The writing is good and the story was intriguing at first. 3)The character development is quite good. 4)The ending did not work. 4 stars - October 20, 2010--
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did NOT enjoy this book, but I did get over the fact that it is a non-fantasy book by taking a chance on it. Unfortunately, this book failed in every aspect for me. First off, the writing was horrendous, in my opinion, at times, it's horrible. The characters were either not good enough, or they had no depth. The plot was bland and the romance, well, there was just not enough love in the book for me to care about. The fact that I'm going to try to defend the book by saying that I didn't really dislike it. I didn�t understand the reasons why it made me feel the way I did, because the reasons were really vague. I felt like I was reading a poorly written romance and not a book that could have worked in a fantasy setting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried the book in a college course on religion.   As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the author, John Dehlin, had a real mission to explain his own beliefs. The book is excellent.  There are some weaknesses in the text. I've heard that some people find it difficult to read through the entire book in one sitting, and others do.  I'm glad they had time to address such a big topic in a thoughtful, well-written book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "As a man who is used to being praised and praised and then praised and so on, I felt very slighted by the amount of attention given to how much this book was "worth," in the form of a $16 cover price. I bought this book and am glad I did, because it was a decent read. As a reviewer of short stories, it is important to know that the quality of the work is not nearly as important as its form.   [ This review was originally published on the book's official website ]
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a lot of high hopes for this book. It started off as promising. The opening pages were a little disjointed but I figured I'd just get used to it. However, the more I read the more things bothered me. I don't particularly like horror, but this book had so much potential. I was expecting it to be a bit more dark and creepy. There are some good descriptions of what is happening, but at times it seems a little too "real." In the first part of the book I found myself having to stop the story because I couldn't stomach the ending. In the second part the characters were pretty much completely irrelevant and the story basically ended. It was a pretty poor start, and my rating is pretty much based on the ending (which is just as poor).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last few chapters are a bit tedious.   It's an interesting premise, though, so perhaps I'll have to revisit this one in a few years.  Dawn & I:  Dawn is not a very well-rounded protagonist.  She's a woman who's been in several dangerous situations and who's had some experience with people who are not exactly who they seem to be.  However, she has a few minor flaws: her constant whining, her unwillingness to admit mistakes, and her habit of overreacting to any threat.  All these flaws come from the fact that Dawn is a man, and as such is not immune to male-pattern insecurity.  In the second half of this book we get a bit more of a look at this: Dawn isn't so much an insecure guy as a man who's too insecure to recognize his own insecurity and his own potential.  Dawn is constantly fighting off a feeling of not being strong enough, and she thinks this is the only reason that she's not being able to achieve his goal of being the best fighter in the world.  She's also convinced that her best chance at becoming a better fighter is to stay in the cage as long as possible, and when she does finally do so she finds she can't move on, because she has no choice but to keep going in order to reach her goal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not worth the paper it was written on    It is the kind of book you read to relax or just get to know a good writer;   But it was NOT a good read.   If you are a fan of a specific author and/or genre, and you are looking for that one book that will get you excited about a new story,   I give this one a pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would not recommend this book to a newbie. It is a bit difficult to follow, and the narrative feels too slow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You should read more stories like this! I enjoyed it as a novel. It's so hard to write a good review of a bad story (it's a bad one), but I had to do it anyway, because that's the way the book was written, and that's not a very good review. I thought it was very much a "book" with a beginning, middle and end, but it really felt like a collection of short stories. I'm glad I read it, though, because the idea was really fascinating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be very dry and boring, and I really wanted to like it.   The main character, Paul, lives in a nice place but is always unhappy because he is lonely and unloved. When he is able to meet a beautiful girl he really wants to impress, the two have lots of fun, but his relationship with his new friend is complicated and they split up when his girlfriend leaves him.  The story seems to take place over the course of a year or so, but I don't know where the author gets all her information from.  At some point I got the sense that she is getting a lot of details from her friends that she then uses to make her story come alive.  I wasn't impressed with the book as a whole, but the story was pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. The story had some aspects of "The Great Gatsby", the world building was a bit slow but the characters were likable, the world felt like it was full of a sense of wonder, and it had a lot of mystery. However, all of these aspects come at a price and there were parts of the book that were very cliche (like the heroine's brother trying to kidnap her). The characters felt like a waste of time, as did the plot. A novel that has a nice twist at the end, but a plot that goes nowhere. That being said, the author has had quite a good record for the past decade or so (see: "The Queen of Swords" and "The Black Prism").  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "   ...the book has an interesting idea about a character who discovers how she has been living her entire life by pretending to be a monster and a beast but is actually a beautiful young woman. She doesn't seem to feel like the hero of this story as well and ends up being a disappointment."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book tells the reader how much he/she owes someone else and how much a debt they owe their victim. It would have been better if he/She had simply mentioned it."   "As a teacher I was horrified to see this book. There is absolutely nothing in there to help students who may be struggling with their own lives."  "I was pretty disgusted to find this in a public library. I found out that the title " The Black Book " came from a book by the same name by a very famous author. I believe this book is the real deal because its based on the real life events in the life of an actual black man who killed four people in a shooting. The book was written by a guy named Charles Bronson. And I have no doubt the events it tells are all true.  I have never been on a shooting or a shooting spree. But, I am pretty certain that the person responsible for the shootings that were mentioned in this book really did do it.  "The main reason I was appalled by this book was because it was not an autobiography of someone who was a true victim. He actually had a pretty solid family life and was a member of the NAACP before he became a real hitman."  "I'm not quite sure what the'real story' is of the man that bruno described. I don't really care for guns, though I was told that was his real passion. "  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the book and read it. I don't know about the author, he doesn't have much knowledge of ancient history and only knows a little bit of the story about Jesus but from what he wrote he has a lot to say about a few of the events he mentions. The author starts off with a pretty good story about the Jews trying to destroy the temple but as he goes on it starts getting more and more ridiculous. I thought about writing a review on the book but I don�t have much to say so I will let someone else write that review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to see if I would enjoy it, and I really did, but it was soooo boring it was a waste of money. The book has a lot of great material, but the author does not know what to do with it. I had to reread chapters a few times just because I didn't understand exactly what the book was about. As for the characters in the book, I think there was a couple of interesting ones (I don't think that's a bad thing), but the book is just so boring and predictable. I read the first book in the series so I'm expecting that this book will be the same.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . I didn't like the way they decided that the first woman has to have a boyfriend to stay at home and the second girl has to work because there's no other women around. I thought it would be a good idea to have the women get married and be living together. I was disappointed that it wasn't. Also, the author has a way of describing things in detail that are not necessary. I wish we got to see how the girls met or what the future looks like. I wanted to know more about them besides what the author told us.   * I don't understand why there's a guy who can't be faithful. Why do you get married in the first place? You have to be the best woman on the planet.  The book is so long that I only got to the part about sex. I really don't know why this book is popular. It's boring and not very interesting. I don' t like romance. The fact that the author put a lot of effort to make this book interesting doesn't mean I like the book.  * This is the first time I got a book that has an adult relationship, but the characters don't seem mature enough to handle it.  There's something wrong about how the author wrote their characters. There's a girl in the book who's not good enough to be married. There is no hint why her parents didn't want her to go through the trouble of getting married. I'm not sure what it was about the book that interested me, but there are a few things in this book that I like: 1) I liked how they said that they were going to stay together and had a lot to talk about. I think that they are supposed to stay faithful. However, it's not clear whether or not they have a future together or whether they're going to be together after the wedding. 2) I really liked the way the author described the different characters.  1) They are really good at describing the houses. It was like I was looking at a picture book of a village. 2. Their marriage was so different. They didn't have a lot in common. They never really talked about what they'd like to do. Their personalities are different. I liked that they couldn't be together because of their differences. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book after being recommended it by a professor. I wanted to like it, but I think I probably could have used a little more time. "I never wanted anything so much in my life so bad." "I never knew anything was wrong with me."   "My father used to tell me that I was ugly.   "He would hit me.  "I know it sounds like a bad thing, but it was my father that was mean to me. My mother had a good heart."  "She is the reason I'm going to go back home." The girl in the story is being sexually assaulted by her step father.  The father has the stepdaughter tied up in a basement.  He then takes a butcher knife and tells her, "The only reason you aren't dead is because you're very small."  At the end, the father has her tie the butcher knife to a table and stabs her in the heart. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a horrible book. If it weren't for my goodreads group it would be on the top 5 worst books of all time. It makes so much sense, but then again I can only write for myself. I have a bad habit of making a bad review, but in this case I couldn't write anything good. The characters are all idiots with the most awful attitudes. This was not a book I enjoyed and it took me a long time to read and read again because the first time I actually felt like I was taking part in the book and I was going to be the happy reader. I felt like a fool.   1.5 Stars I didn't want to like this book. At all. This is a bad novel. I'm going to go ahead and say that.  3 Stars   I think that this is an interesting character. I wish I had the book in front of me and would have read it. If I had it in front I would have had a better time of reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is very bad. It has a lot of good points and an interesting story, but it's completely cliche and has been done better before.    I'm glad I picked it up because it was fun and there was a great "hug".   I liked this book because it had a nice story and the characters were all a lot like me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible. My husband bought this book to read it to me for Christmas. I had to finish it within a week because of the bad writing. I'm a writer and I'm not used to writing long stories in which the characters seem to be doing nothing but talking about what the book is about. This book just doesn't come off as being that fun. The characters are flat, their voices are flat and they never seem to have any fun whatsoever. The plot doesn't go anywhere and in the end the book leaves you just as bored as when you started it. You have to try to finish the book if you want a good time with a great story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad it has made me re-read it from the beginning. If it had been good it would have been worth it. If you have never heard of this writer and are looking for an interesting book and good writing I would suggest you wait a little before buying this book. I would even say wait until your child has finished it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about what a normal day in the life of a female lead character would be like for her if she was a boy.   This book focuses on how she would handle being teased by boys and how her father, a male, would handle it.  She has to figure out the difference between boys and girls because boys are not boys   Her father was an alcoholic and never wanted kids and her mother is a stay at home mama.  In the book, we learn that her father abused his alcoholic daughter and in this book, she is given the same treatment   She is told by her father that her mother was a bad person who couldn't do anything right.  As a result of her mother's abuse, her father never wants her to get married and he never wants to be a father.  He also doesn't believe in his daughter's ability to make a good mother.  His views of fathers and daughters is skewed because, his father was also an alcoholic, but a good alcoholic.  He was so good that he didn't know it because he never drank alcohol.  This is why he never wanted children and he told his daughter to stay away from him because she would be an unmarriageable woman.  Now, I know that's a bad review.  But the book isn't bad and the main character isn't a bad character.  I do think that the author used a girl to make her point.  So I do agree with some of the reviewers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The thing that bothers me the most about this book is the fact that the author is a fan of "Hans Christian Anderson's Frankenstein". I mean, come on. This book is supposed to be a homage to the classic monster movie and the author has gone as far as to name his monster "The Bride". So if that means that this is a rip-off then I'm okay with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book should be given a low rating because there was only about two chapters I actually liked in this book. The second chapter where we are introduced to the villain who is the one responsible for the death of one of the characters made no sense to me as the villain seems to have some kind of vendetta towards the main character. The other chapters in this novel were either very boring or made no difference whatsoever. It's hard to judge this book as it's not very good at telling a story and it's a very easy read. The author should've at least tried to give us more than one side to this story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My parents and I listened to this book together because my mom loves to listen to the same story from the same author over and over. I have to admit that this story was very long, about 3 or 4 hours, so I would have preferred a shorter version of the story, but overall I think this is a good read. However, I wish that there was an ending at the very end of the book so that the reader would feel that they had been really connected with the author's story. It was really difficult for me to finish because I just wanted to know what would happen to the character that is going to make him/her be the next emperor. I'm going to try reading this story again from beginning to end so that I will be able to understand why the author did not go that extra mile in the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     A lot of what I've seen here isn't really true. That's not really a problem, as it makes the book less enjoyable, but it is a bit annoying. The book has a lot of good ideas, but the writing lacks polish and polish is the difference between a mediocre book and a great one. The writing doesn't quite flow well. And the ending is also...I don't even know what the word is, but is so unsatisfying. It's also quite predictable, and I can't even remember what happened at the end, since it was all a blur.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole experience of reading this book was a chore, not fun. The book starts with a nice little introduction on science and evolution. From there the author jumps right in to "the" "evidence" that is behind creationism. What he is really telling is that people in the past have believed in "a god," so there must be something there. I find this kind of a cop out to be so annoying, but at least this is an excuse to avoid thinking about what people have always believed or a reasonable explanation for why there has always been a god. The author starts off with the fact that people today are atheists because of secular education and the media, but as a biologist I am inclined to agree with him, as he makes the same point. I found that there were no arguments against the creation theory, no rebuttals to the creationist point of view. No one says, "no, you can't prove creation." The author seems to be in the same camp as creationists on this issue, in fact he seems to support them in every way possible, but it just doesn't add up in his opinion. I just found it extremely annoying and made me think that he had no reason to be writing this book, and just wanted attention. Also, the fact he says he "did not like the book" when I have never had a problem with his previous works. I have been reading some good books on evolution and he has never been anything but kind and helpful to me, as well as funny and entertaining. This book just makes me think he is one of those people who thinks the bible is not just fiction, but true! He also seems to believe in "intelligent design" (which I am not a fan of), and as I said earlier, in my opinion I think this makes him a bad person and a liar. Not a good book, not a bad read, just very frustrating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of books about the American Revolution and I was extremely excited to finally get my hands on this one because I'm an history geek.   Unfortunately, I couldn't be more disappointed. The author's theory of the Revolution is so vague that it's difficult to know what it even means to "abolish" a government.  The "fictional" background that he uses is extremely simplistic, and even his explanations for the many different groups in the Revolution doesn't add up to a coherent narrative.  He has the American colonists as some sort of cult of religion (with a religious bent) and then proceeds to explain how a religious cult became a political party.  I thought this book was going to be so good, but instead it's a collection of incoherent conspiracy theories, poorly researched history, and completely unbelievable historical facts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first chapter and I was expecting something interesting and deep. And I was right. I was in love with the characters, and loved the world, and thought the plot was interesting. I also thought that the author didn't really want the reader to be left hanging with this story. If anything, the reader was given some clues in the beginning that hinted at some interesting plot twists to come, and I enjoyed it all. I wasn't too sure, however, about the ending. The author said it was going to be like the classic mystery story, and it seemed to me that he was making up the plot points. I think, since this book is basically about romance, that it is an excellent choice of genre for a romantic suspense/thriller. It has the usual mystery tropes, and the plot twists are interesting (and I didn't mind those as much as I thought I might), but it isn't really a mystery in the traditional sense of the word.   Conclusion:  I liked the book. There are some things about it that I didn"t like, and they do happen from time to time. I guess I didn"(t care about those though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so ready to have my mind blown, but all it did was leave me feeling like a big sack of bricks.   The book begins with an introduction that is so full of pompous jargon, that it's difficult to tell whether this is a "prose book" (a genre that is too easy for authors to get away with writing) or a "poetic" book (a style that requires a lot of time and patience).   But once the prose starts, it's obvious that no one is kidding.  There's a lot to chew on, but the author is just so obviously obsessed with making her point.  I suppose it's understandable that she wrote her book in the hopes of being published in a genre that she hates (in her opinion, literary fiction doesn't have a bad case of being written by "realists" who think they are authors), and I guess I can understand why she wanted to create a book that people would get offended about.  But I just can't see any point to this.  It's not so much that the prose is bad.  The prose has been criticized to the extent that it has the potential to be really bad.    But the fact that she says that she's writing to "get out of bed every morning, go on a date, and have a good time," is a little too "I'm writing for you to hate me" for me.  As a story, it has no place in the modern age.  My only hope is that the editors who are going to read this and reject it are the ones that aren't really writing for me, or at least are writing in a way that's so obtuse that it makes me want to give up after a couple of pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first started reading the book, I was excited. I think I liked some of the ideas and the idea of "releasing your emotions" really appealed to me, although it didn't really turn out that way. I was interested in the theory of releasing emotions, and how it might work in some situations. But the problem is that the author goes off on a tangent about all the wrong things that are wrong with the current American political system. I understand that she has a point about how the system is broken and has to be fixed, but her "how-to" book is really just a collection of bad ideas. Some of her ideas are just plain crazy, and there is no good explanation for how they would actually work out. The main reason that I dropped this book at the last minute was because the book was really frustrating. I wanted to believe that it was an interesting take on the current political system, but the author just couldn't figure it out. Overall, it's really hard to give this a negative rating. It just didn't seem to be well-thought out.   Rating:  B-
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not a good book at all.   There is nothing about this book that I like.  I would not recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a train wreck!  The author has no clue how to write.  She has no idea how to develop characters.  The characters do NOT develop like real people.  These people are so weak.  There is no chemistry.  A little of this and a little of that, but none of it makes for a compelling book.  My favourite part of the book is the ending.  I'm surprised the book was so successful, but it had little to no suspense or suspenseful moments.   "The only way to save your life is to change it."   The main character was so annoying, and so far out of the story, I didn't know if it was supposed to be a real life situation or if it should have been a comedy.  It was all so fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am glad I did not pick this up before it became available. I found the story boring, but very well written. The pacing was very slow, but not for my taste. I think you would not want to read the whole book in one sitting, but at least I got to know more about the protagonist and her life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're like me, you read this book on a Kindle Fire and couldn't get enough.   I don't have the same Kindle as my friend who has the Kindle 2 but it's just as good.  This one I really enjoyed.  It has a very well written and realistic story and the characters were well drawn.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes realistic stories or fantasy.  My only complaint is that I didn't really care for the final book in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book, I realized that I will never purchase another YA book from this author. This is a very frustrating experience to say the least. The book starts off with a lot of hype and promises, the author then completely falls flat on his face as a storyteller. He seems to be so good with writing that he just doesn't know what to do with his characters. The characters have absolutely no depth to them as they do not get to really develop. The author does give the story a happy ending but it is far from it. I also felt as if I was watching a kid's show for the first half of the book when in fact the story is not about kids at all. The main character is supposed to be a little girl with a magical power but has no interest in magic at all until the ending when she suddenly decides to become a mage and does what most people would do when they are given magical powers. He also has two little sisters and a big brother who both have magic powers. At the beginning of the story, you are like oh this is a good book but then he ends up in an awkward situation and you are just like ok so there's that. I found it hard to connect with these characters as there were so many plot holes that made me roll my eyes at them. I felt as though the author was trying to do a cute/hilarious story but it just didn't work out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all. I was trying to find an adult book to read for my brother who loves the Disney movies. This book is a mix of the two and had my brother throwing up by the end of it.   - A great book, but really annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book is really well done, with a little humour mixed in. The book goes off in an unexpected direction, but for the most part the story is decent. The only complaint that I can make about the story was that the author, like most authors, has a habit of talking about how his world "looks" from the perspective of a particular race (the "noble savages"). And this is also the reason for the majority of the plot holes, such as the whole "the evil, cruel, and cunning man" thing, which is also one of the most annoying parts of the story.   The second half of this book starts out in a much better way, but then it turns into a confusing mess, which, unfortunately, is not uncommon for these kinds of books. The story begins with an action, which takes place outside of the "garden". This action is a battle between the noble savages and the evil, conniving, murderous "darkness". After the battle is over, the characters begin to discuss the events that happened, and as you would expect, the noble and evil savages are portrayed in a negative way. This is an example of the author trying to "prove" that the "nobles" are superior to the "darkies", which is a common trope in these kind of books, especially in fantasy. But in this case, the author makes his case completely lame and stupid. One of the characters even refers to the darkies as "cattle", despite the fact that the Dark-Man is a highly intelligent and powerful creature. The "evil" savages, on the other hand, are portrayed as barbaric, savage and mean. They are also completely without emotion and are depicted as a bad example of humanity. In short, the "evil savages" are a lot more like the "good savages", which the author also makes a habit out of, so the idea that they are inferior is really odd.   and the last bit... well, it's a spoiler, but it is so weird that I couldn't read this book anymore after the last sentence. I will skip over it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand the point of this book.   In every story, the main characters have a great problem that is solved through magic. In the book that I read, it's solved by a man using his magical sword to cut a man in half, only to have the sword break into pieces as he does so.  In the next story, it takes a magical sword.  The third story, a giant.  And so on.  It was so boring, I felt like I was being lectured about how magic solves problems by making everything better.  What would a good book be without a twist or a moral? I know that in books where magic is used to solve problems, the magic usually saves the day, but I guess that would be boring.  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel about this book because it's not what I would describe as a good fantasy book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a horrible read. I hated every second of it and almost had a heart attack when I finished it. I found the characters to be poorly written, annoying, and in no way likable. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are the most annoying, the whole thing was made to feel like a series of terrible jokes, and the ending leaves the reader with a very bitter feeling.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book for the first time in 2015, at age 22. I didn't like the book, but after reading the other reviews, I decided I'd give it a try. I read it in July 2015 and the following month I bought the book. I enjoyed the book but I was disappointed in the ending. I am not sure I want to read it again, but if I read a book again with good reviews from other readers, I might give it another shot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I finished reading this book, I said to myself "I don't think I'm getting through this." The writing is so stiff that when you're reading a story, you are really immersed in it, which makes it a bit frustrating. However, the characters all do have a spark of life and even the dullest character is interesting at times. When I started reading, I expected something that looked like a rehash of a book by another author. The book I was looking for didn't exist; the author got the basic structure of the first book right, but it just was so cliched and predictable that I just knew that I was going to hate it.   A negative review is not a good review.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was my first purchase of a book. This was a bad buy.   I don't know about the other people, but I have to say that the cover was pretty lame. It was not at all that attractive.  The inside of the book was full of boring stuff about a woman.  This is a book for ladies only.  At least the authors should have left out the "boredom" part and added something about how this is the beginning of a young woman's sexual awakening.  I really wanted to read about her making the best of a new found sexual awakening when she gets married, but that isn't the story.   She meets a guy and she takes the time to really know him, to talk about how she is going to be with him, etc. She then comes out and decides she is ready to make love to him. But instead of that, she is taken by the guy to his house. She has some good times in the house, but her feelings for him are still very much out of the picture.  The story seems to go from here to there. I did enjoy a couple of the more funny parts of the story, but the rest of the material is very boring.  She goes from being a married young woman to being a young, single woman who can have sexual adventures. It is so boring. I would be happy if I could be a single, young, sexual woman, but all I got in this book was the girl on the cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good story and I liked the end part with the ending. The end of book 5 is the first time that you realize the author is just not a very good writer. The story is all about the boy in the story and all the other characters aren't part of his story. It's an anti-climax. Not a bad ending, but I'd go elsewhere for a similar ending.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I read this book I thought the plot was a good idea. It has some great twists and the characters have all the traits that you would expect from a bad guy and a good guy. The problem is that it takes about 60 pages or so and it goes nowhere. The main character doesn't even really do anything until the end.   I mean he gets killed. That's about it. The villains are nothing more than the "villainous" equivalent of the "good guy" or the "evil villain." So basically they're just the same as the bad guy but with more of the same.  The plot is really weak.  The characters are really shallow.  I found the writing to be extremely poor. I mean it's not bad but it's really poor. There are some really good words but they're often used in a way that doesn't make much sense. And sometimes even if you get the point, the way it's phrased leaves you wondering what the characters were even thinking. I'm not sure if I'm going to pick this book up, and I would probably prefer something with better plot because the characters just didn't work for me at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really have much to say about this book. It's basically a list of "how to be a shitty writer" and the author does the very worst job of presenting any kind of argument for why this might happen. The whole thing is a waste of everyone's time, and in the end the point becomes moot as it just ends up saying "write better, be nicer, write better, write like a man, write so you can get laid, write with integrity, write in a way that reflects your personality, write to get published, write for a big company, write about what you know, and don't be this weird person that is only writing things that are so bad".    (Aka "What it is to be bad")    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had to force myself to finish this book, to give it any kind of chance at all.   There is absolutely no reason to read this book.  I'm sorry, but this was the biggest waste of a first book I have ever made.  It was poorly written, poorly edited, poorly organized, poorly structured, poorly paced.  None of these things were the fault of the author, all of these are the fault (or more accurately, responsibility) of the editor. The only reason this book is even in the same universe as the previous two is the similarity of the last two books' plot-lines.  The characters, plot-line, etc...all feel so uninspired and rushed and contrived that any sense of fun is completely destroyed.  This is a book about a young boy and his father.  They travel to New York (as they are named) and the father is a famous author (the only one) who has made a huge splash with his work.  All of his work is about a famous artist, and the only thing more famous than the artist is the artist's daughter.  When she turns 14 her father's publisher dies and the author leaves the world of his famous books to be with his daughter. But not before making her a living memorial for his art:  It seems the author is making a book with the same concept as the short story that was published before this book and I wonder if the editor had to change things around a bit in order for this book to work. The other thing is that they are going on a trip that has nothing to do with his father's books.  How many of us can remember the name of the first book we ever read?  There was something about that book that was special, that grabbed hold of us at a very young age and would stay with us long after we were old enough to read for ourselves.  But this is nothing like that book.   In fact the character's name is not even mentioned, he is only called 'Maggie' on a few occasions, and his only friends are the two who live at his old home: the boy and the girl with the red hair. The girl is just a bit too naive for his taste for some reason.  Why she lives with him at all I'll never know.  That said, he does have one major love interest: a girl named Mary and the boy has a girlfriend but she is so
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was a mess, but I had a lot of fun reading it. It took me a long time to understand what was happening in the plot. Some things were explained later, but they weren't explained in a way that made sense. Some elements were just completely not made clear for me. Also, the story had a very bad ending. The ending was not a good one. I don't know if I will continue reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the book The Way of the Gun it tells the story of a gun control activist. There is a part in the book where he says "the Second Amendment is not about hunting; it is about self-defense." I just had to comment on this comment because I was a Second Amendment advocate before I started with this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The book was fun, but in the end it was just a very bad book, which I can say after reading several more books.   A few characters were very well developed, but I was never fully sucked into their story.  The writing was sometimes awkward, but still fun to read.  In conclusion:  In conclusion, if you like a bit of adventure, action, and drama, this may be for you.  I give the book 4.5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     In retrospect I wish I hadn't been so hasty. I thought that as a long time fantasy fan, I was a good enough fantasy writer to handle this.      I have found this book to be a very dry read. It's not necessarily bad but there are moments where I want to rip my eyes out, because it's so dull and predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was okay, but I don't think the plot was very good.   I didn't really like the main character or the "other guy", so I was a bit disappointed with the book.  The narrator's voice was a little odd at times, but she was ok. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book, however I can't recommend this book to everyone. The book isn't very interesting, there are no characters I cared about or felt a connection with. The story had no direction and I wasn't interested in the characters or what was happening.   The book is a great introduction to a fantasy world and I would give it a four, if it was less boring and the main character wasn't so stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book. I bought it as a gift for a friend. I found it difficult to get past the first chapter. I loved the character of Mrs. Miller, she's a sweet old lady. I enjoyed her quirkiness and her adventures with her husband. However, the book felt rushed and it made me really angry at the end. I guess you need to read the entire book to understand all the twists and turns. If you don't care for the humor, try the book with a friend or a favorite book or something. I would suggest that you read it with someone you know who's more intelligent than you are. It's a good book that has a lot of fun for those of us who like that kind of book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book was good but I really don't like the main character much at all. I love the idea and I really liked the ending but this book is just so boring and pointless that I really think it should have been called "How to stop worrying and Love Your Job".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband gave this book 5 stars but he didn't like the ending. So the book ended on a confusing and weird note which wasn't as good as I had hoped. He is a fan of books about magic but has never heard of the author before. The only negative that I found about the book was it felt a little short.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A great idea for a great book but a terrible execution. It would be good if it was a single book but it is two and a half books in length, and then three in one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I never realized how difficult it is to actually get a book to read for more than five minutes. I didn't know it would be a challenge to keep reading through a book that has a lot going on. The first two-thirds of the book had a lot to be said about the value of the word "fuck". The book doesn't get a passing grade, but if I had to give the book a D+ I'd give it an A. The book is funny and I wish I could have been entertained more, but this book is about the importance of the internet in this day and age and not how to be able to use it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts by presenting some excellent information. It is based on my own research in the field, as well as on the observations of various researchers in the fields. But the book goes on to do a lot of the same thing that is done in an introductory psychology book. In fact, the book is a textbook of basic personality types. It tells you that introverts (of which I am a type) are more logical and practical than extroverts, but it tells you nothing about how the personality types work together to make the introvert work more effectively. This book does not tell you anything you really need to know about the personality type theory except what you can get out of it if you know the theory and how to use it. You have to be a very smart person to even get the main ideas. The book also gets into very arcane details about various personality tests. The author thinks he has a good handle on personality, but he is just wrong. If you are only interested in personality theory, this is not a bad read. If, on the other hand, you want to find out how to work with your personality to get the most out of your career, then you should probably skip this book. If your main interest is in personality, you can read the book yourself, but you will probably just be confused.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is no way that I can like this book. I will be buying the full book as soon as I can find it, but I can't say it is enjoyable at all.   I have a really bad feeling about this book, but for the sake of argument, let's assume it's just as bad as all the other books I've read by him.  The author clearly has never written a book before. This book is so bad that even though I know what's in it, I can still see the errors in the writing that are apparent every chapter, even though it's clearly written by a novice writer (at least it was when I was first reading it). I'm sorry, but this book is a complete waste of time.  No matter how bad he is, his stories are always entertaining:  This was the best book I read in 2016. It was funny, dramatic, and interesting. I've got all of his books that I liked, but he's definitely better than most, so this is definitely a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am so disappointed with this book.   1. The protagonist was described as the son of a scientist who works on a secret project for some unknown reason.  While the author stated that the protagonist had an interest in science, I think this was an excuse to put in an extra-terrestrials.  2. The main character didn't make sense.  3. The novel was about a family who moved to a farm in the country.  We were told the plot centered around the family who had to fight the mysterious and nasty creature.  4. The description of the farm was absolutely ridiculous.  For starters the book was set in a small town.  It was completely overrun with zombies who all ate people's brains.  So what happened next was that the family decided to kill off the zombie infestation.  5. The family did manage to put down the zombie menace but only after getting slaughtered on their own farm.  6. The only way the main characters were able to survive the apocalypse was by moving to a remote farmhouse to hide from the zombies.  7. The book ends on a very disturbing note.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a few reviews saying the book was great and then got bored by the last third and just quit reading. I've got to say, that's my biggest disappointment with this book. I have had a lot of luck when it comes to reading fantasy. I think my parents are huge fans of George R.R. Martin (so many books, they have a pile in their garage). So when I first read the Song of Ice and Fire series, I thought I was doing alright. I loved the first two books. I didn't like this third book. Not at all.   So I did what many do when they're having trouble with a book: I checked it out from my library. This is my second book in the series (the first is a Dune series). First, the author writes a "preview" of the third book (this is a novel, so it doesn't really have one. But, still...) The author starts the book by describing what is going to happen to Ned and Ned's mother during the winter. Then, Ned and his brother Robb, try to come up with a way to escape the warring Houses. Robb, of course, doesn't listen to Ned, but is intrigued by the idea. But when he comes across a young, handsome lord, and he thinks of marrying his daughter, Robb is tempted to follow this lord's advice. So he runs away from home with his young wife, Catelyn, but gets caught and thrown in a cell. Now, this is where the plot is supposed to come alive. You don't have to have read the book yet, but this was one of the better ideas in the book. If you want to get more of a idea of what is happening, read the preview, and then go read the first book in this series. But the book, I have to say... doesn't work for me. I like the story, I like how the author keeps things exciting, but the writing is too choppy. I'm not going to spoil anything but the way the author puts words in his stories makes the reader sit up and think. So, I'm left feeling confused and bored. The whole book, it just doesn't feel right. I'll tell you why, because this is not just about Ned's story, this isn't about the war, but more so about why the stories are told the way they are. This doesn't make a good story
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are parts I enjoyed. Part 1 was great. Part 2 and part 3 are interesting. I do wonder what the characters were thinking.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is really boring, and you have to slog through to the end. There are lots of twists and turns and character development, but most of the book is just "spamming the reader" with plot and characters (and sometimes you even learn something that makes you wonder why someone would choose to go that way).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is a really good book, but it does go off track pretty fast. It starts out with a cool story about a man trying to make it as a professional basketball player but is rejected by all the big name teams in the NBA. He works a little harder and makes some new friends, and a new chance comes along. But he realizes he's made too many bad decisions and has no real career in front of him. That's not what you want to hear at first, but the book has a lot of really interesting people talking about some pretty cool stories, and it keeps the interest up pretty much throughout. But by the end of the book, it's pretty predictable and you're pretty sure what's going to happen.   One of the big things that bothered me was that in the end he basically says "you can get to the NBA, and you can get better at basketball". He's still going to say that, and I don't really believe that.       On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this book: 7 or 8?   I actually think this book is a pretty good read. The characters are fun and well fleshed out. I liked the main character, and found myself wishing he'd have a better shot. The book really doesn't let him down and I have a hard time believing that would happen. I've read a lot about NBA basketball, and they rarely seem as crazy as they are here, which is a real plus. There's a few other characters that get a lot more attention than they should, but they were interesting enough and really were a part of the story as well. I don;t really think the author was going for a Michael Jordan-type hero, but he had some pretty interesting moments. If I had to give it a lower rating, I'd probably say the book could have been a little shorter and I'd have liked to see some of the more significant characters get a little more air time.  I would recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It was a little disappointing, as the author seems to have been more interested in the plot and the characters than in the world building, which seemed lacking a little bit"  Summary  This book is an update of the "Dangerous Women" series written by Lois McMaster Bujold and Peter Newman, which is generally considered a classic book.  The author makes a point of introducing all the main characters before they get married, making them less believable. A few of the other female characters appear later in the series. 's book is also a re-write of " The Mirror Empire " but in a different universe, with a different viewpoint. The main character's name is now Kaya, the heroine of the book. The female hero has a male love interest, and has a much more interesting back story. , but in which the main character is a member of an elite women's militia, has a female love interest. Kaya goes through a transformation from a hard-as-nails fighter to a weak-willed pacifist, and the book ends with a love-story. This makes the book much less of a love story and more a fantasy novel with action.  to be more of a fantasy rather than an action novel. As far as I know, there are no sequels. The author notes in the author's note that if you've read "The Mirror Empire" you should probably not read "Sleeping Fire" as a retelling. I think it's a little too heavy-handed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I got hooked on the first page. The descriptions were descriptive and interesting and the setting was awesome. It was fun. But it quickly fell apart, mostly because the story was too short and was repetitive.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have purchased a number of the "books of the month" but have been disappointed as I have not received them before, even though I have paid full price. As a self-help reader I have seen some things that I have deemed as not good enough for the Self-Help genre.   In the meantime I bought the book of the Month and was delighted to find that it was a good book about the self-esteem of women and some common-sense steps that a woman should take to enhance her self-confidence and self-worth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually read sci-fi but the author is so good   that I have to buy it. The bad things are in the first few chapters. The author should use the proper space to explain everything, as a newbie it makes the whole thing seem complicated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As with all good things in life, a book I would call a "B" book would have many positives. However, this book had too much bad. It was poorly written, the book was rushed and I found the book to be poorly paced. The ending of the book came at a point that I wasn't totally happy with.  When the author writes "My name is Ander, and I am a writer. I want to write, I want my stories to matter." the reader needs to understand that he or she will be spending a lot of time with the character who is writing, as this character may be completely insane and is writing this because of a "loathing for his mother" that is not a real loathing, but rather a delusion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "I've been reading this for a year and still no idea what's going on."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a really cool read. I've never read anything like it, or even anything by the same author, and I've read tons of science fiction, including some from the 80's. This one was a little dated, but it was good science fiction. The only thing is that the plot, as far as I can tell, is almost entirely focused on a single character, with the author seeming to avoid introducing other characters as the story goes on. This is my main objection to the book, in addition to some of the plot holes I noticed and the fact that it was a bit dry-sounding at points.   I wish there had been more background on the people the characters are from, I suppose. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say, I really liked this book. I mean, it's a bit more than just another YA book; it's an enjoyable, though perhaps slightly predictable story. And this book is a bit better than "I don't want to go to college" and it makes sense that the main character is going to try. The problem is that all of the other characters are not so happy about it, and all of them are a little over-protective of the younger girl, even when she's the one who did all the hard work to get to where she is. The ending was also a bit unsatisfying; although the author's first goal was to show the main characters as flawed, sometimes a little annoying, sometimes just downright annoying, the author does not reach her ultimate conclusion. As a result, I have decided to give the book another chance, not because I really enjoyed the story (I didn't) but because of the ending. I think it might be the first YA novel to show a little more depth to the characters than just the obvious good or bad. The only thing that I disliked about the book is the ending, which leaves us with a rather unsatisfying feel, and I'd like to see some more depth. I also have to mention that although it's not a YA, it has a great plot; so I'm sure many readers will enjoy it and maybe get a bit involved as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I heard about it from my friend, and was glad that I did. However, I don't believe that this book is all that great. It's good as a stand-alone, but the writing style, the story and the characters are so bad that it's just plain boring. A little bit of everything is good, but there are some too many ideas about what it's like to be the opposite sex that make you say "why did I read this again?" The main characters are just awful; they don't have that spark. There are some interesting characters, and I think it would've been more interesting if it focused more on some of the more interesting female characters, but I think this book will get you hooked on the idea of a very bad, very female "I" character, and you won't be able to shake that image even if you keep reading.  8 of 9 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have loved the books by David Baldacci and I hope the sequel can live up to the original.   The story picks up right where the first book left off and this book is a solid 4.5 stars.  It's not perfect, but I think the author's first book,  My Bloody Valentine: The Complete Stories,   can stand on its own as a great album.  However, I feel that Baldacci did a good job bringing a second generation of music to the spotlight and it was definitely worth reading the book that came before it.  I did have one major problem with the story:  The protagonist, the daughter of a woman who has worked at a music shop, is constantly complaining about her momma and her father. This has been done in some books before, but is done so poorly in this one that it makes the reader want to kick the girl's ass.  This also takes the book too seriously and I don't think it was well thought out or written.  Overall, it's a solid book that you might enjoy but not the best thing in the world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great story, well done. I liked the characters, although some of the characters seem to be the same as in other stories. I can see a lot of similarities in these characters, so I don't know if it was really intentional. The ending, which is an afterthought is not very exciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First I love the fact that this book is based on a comic book series.   It was funny but I would have liked to see more action and I think I would enjoy this book more as a graphic novel as well.  It's not that I don't like this book,   but for whatever reason I didn't find it as enjoyable as I expected. The plot is well presented but for some reason I never felt that this was all that bad and I thought there were some really good jokes in there, even with the jokes not working for me and the plot going nowhere. The story is not as funny as it should be either and there is some really gross stuff about to happen so you have that going for you but there is not enough going for it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm in the middle of reading this, and it was an excellent read until, in the very last chapter, the author goes to some real nastiness on the part of the "white male."   The author's main purpose is to tell a story.   If you want to see how this is done in the "good" books, you can read The Hunger Games and The Handmaid's Tale.  It's just that in this book he tries to get away from that (which is the whole point).   For me, I wanted to like this, I just didn't want to get the ending I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought a copy of this book for the kids in my class. I wanted it for myself. When it arrived, I was a little disappointed. The pictures were very cute, but I couldn't get a handle on what was going on. The story was a mess. The girl dies and the main character gets superpowers from a frog she killed that she can't stop playing with. It's supposed to be the end of the book, but instead we are thrown in another book to find out what happens to the main villain. I'm really hoping that this is just the start of another mess.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I felt like the book is missing something that makes it great...   I don't have a big interest in history.   I love the series and enjoyed the books in the series, so I was happy to see the sixth in the book line.  I wish I knew a little more about the history of America before I read it.  The book has a very well done map with the United States, a big chunk of the world, and a bunch of countries that weren't mentioned in the books but had something to do with America.  This makes it a little confusing when you have to choose where you are.  Maybe if I hadn't already read the series I would have gotten something more out of it... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I found this book to be just a disappointment after reading all the hype. The author has so far failed to provide a satisfactory explanation as to how the power that can be found in God and the Bible can be used to change the world for the better. This book is so short because it really could not have been that bad. The main purpose of this book is to point out that we need God's forgiveness in order to achieve a change in the world around us. I personally did not find this to be very helpful and even found that this was a book written by the same author as The Case for Christ. We need the Holy Spirit and not God's help to bring about change.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book doesn't make any sense, it's like some weird cross between a horror story and a science fiction novel.  I understand this is a sequel to the "Dawn of the Dead" books but this is just a complete and utter mess of a novel, the only saving grace is that it contains several horror elements which was something I really missed with the first book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a very poor book, that is, if you are a good reader. The writing is very good, however the editing is so poor that I cannot find the point that I could see in this book.   A very boring story about a person that is in love with a different man, and then he finds that man is also in love to him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have only read a few of the works written by William Faulkner and I have to say that I feel Faulkners works are a lot more enjoyable than the works by other great writers. The story in his masterpiece "Innocence" is very clever but also very silly and sometimes the story just makes no sense at all. It is a shame that Faulkeners works have been so neglected because there are definitely more enjoyable and better books by Faulkerson out there.   I'm not sure what is the issue here.  This is one of the only books that is in English? I thought I was just reading something from a German newspaper.  I don't know what a "Toledo" is? No, I thought the only issue was that the book is written in English and is hard to read because of the small type font on a very large page.  The only thing I find offensive about this book is that it's an example of a book that was written in the 20th century and it still makes me laugh every time I read it.  In fact, I don�t even think the fact that it was written so long ago makes it more difficult to read than a book written at the end of the 20 century would.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot, though entertaining, is terribly simplistic. I can see where it could be a useful device for a child's story, but it really isn't. The characters are cliche. The villains, like the evil witch and her minions, are cartoonishly evil. There are a couple of little bits, but they're quickly forgotten when we move to the next main plot point. I found it irritating that the book is presented as a picture book, and that one of the pictures is a picture of a giant frog.  The book, however, is not without entertainment.     The children are so energetic! The writing is cute and not too bad. And, perhaps even more than the children, I found myself looking forward to the book. It was fun to read, and it reminded me of a story about a little girl who can fly! I don't know that it is a good idea to read a story that involves a giant amphibious frog. But I'm glad I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first read the book I was excited by the premise of this story.  It's about a girl who becomes addicted to the drug heroin.   She lives in a small town, is a very smart girl but has no family in the community or anywhere else, and is in a terrible way.  She has never met her father, and doesn't know her mother either.  Then we meet her mother's boyfriend, and his drug problems are very interesting. He's in jail because of a drug case, and she thinks he's a bad person for doing heroin but the heroin itself is bad.  When the boyfriend starts dealing heroin she's angry.  After that we meet a friend of hers who lives with her and her mother, and the way she's treated by her mom.  I found it a very emotional story, and in the beginning I wondered why it was being told, but then I understood that the story was told so we could understand more about this girl's life. The plot is the same as a lot of stories about addicts, the bad choices, the lack of family support, and her own personal struggles.  What I liked about the plot is that it's not just a story about the addicts.  It has a lot to say about all addicts. It's not the perfect drug story but it's pretty good. The story is a bit too slow and I wanted more.  As far as the sex goes, it's good. I just didn't like the sex scenes at the beginning, they were a little cheesy. I have a lot more problems with the story than the sex, but I also felt like it would have been better to leave the sex out and just focus on the main character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am really, really disappointed. This book is poorly written. It's a very long book (over 400 pages), but it's pretty bad. I have to agree with the reviewers that the writing is a little cheesy. For example, there's a section about a guy who's "the king of sex" and his best friend's parents find out that he's a virgin and they come to their senses and make him do some weird things so that the boy won't have to live with the shame of a virgin (i.e. a virgin being sooo horny, or being so horny that he can't control himself). But the guy isn't actually a virgin, so they're still living with the bad sex part of it. And there's other parts about a young girl who has a crush on her boyfriend's sister, and a guy whose sister is dating a guy she's really into, and the dad's daughter. This girl is probably going to grow up and be a lesbian. And she's the only girl in the book who doesn't have a boyfriend. I'm sure it has to do with the father's influence, which is a weird thing to bring up. There are some other minor points too, like a guy telling a girl that "girls are sooo different from boys." But this guy isn the most annoying of all. And this book is about a boy who lives with his parents and has to deal with his virgin status. It feels very forced to me, and it just made the whole book feel like a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for my husband and he loved it and I would recommend it to others.   My one thing with this book is the description of what happens to the people who don't go to college.  I would say that this book wasn't very informative because the information was not in the beginning.  When I got to the end of the book, I realized how much information I had missed.  However, when I started with the book I was excited to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not a good book. I would have rather read a "better book". The book begins with a scene in which a woman takes out her anger with a "macho" friend by beating him, then getting him arrested, when she realizes the friend has done the same thing to her. The friend, a "loner," turns out to have been very well meaning in the beginning, but when the woman discovers the truth about him, he becomes quite the opposite. The author tries to make up for the lack of originality of his main character by using very "masculine" language. The main character is a "man's man" and a "biker" who gets the woman's affections when he's out on the motorcycle trail. The book does not take into consideration the fact that men have different feelings, not all men are macho, and that men and women are both physically attractive and are attracted to other people's bodies. When the woman finds out that the man had the same problem with her, she becomes furious because he seems to be getting away with it. When she discovers his past, she tries to break up with him because she doesn't want a man who has broken his promises to her and is now a jerk and a cheater. But the main character of this book is such a "douche" that she is unable to get over the fact she's been cheated on and wants to do the same to the man. She is only able to give up on the guy because the man has left town and her family is still living there. (Although the main characters are not very believable, the author writes some good dialog.) (hide spoiler)  [There is some good advice to women, but the advice is not specific enough to prevent problems. (hide spoilers) / I also like that this book took place in the south. It was the first time I had read a book that took place at all in the west, and I was glad that the author chose this time. It made me appreciate the South better. And the book does explain the differences between southern and northern Americans. Although there was a slight problem that I didn't expect.The main character, a retired man, becomes the caretaker for a house in a small town and has to deal with the town's "bitchy old ladies" who constantly harass the old man. They call him "Old Man Bull," and he seems like
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "soul-searching" thing is a big rip-off from the way you are looking at things in the real world, which is exactly what you are doing in the book! The "real" thing doesn't work either, since you can't get anywhere with a "real job." The only thing you ever find that is satisfying about "real life" is the end of a relationship, and even then, there's a lot of heartbreak and frustration to overcome.   I found the novel frustrating and boring at times. If I'd read the first three pages and then taken a break, I'd have loved the story.  But I read for the long haul, so I read the entire book in one sitting.  The ending was a let down. If a book is about trying to find true love, it should not be a cliffhanger ending.  I feel like the book is too easy for me to like, even though there are things that make me love the book.  This book was a fun read, but in reality, it would have been better to have a couple more chapters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this. I think I've tried a number of good fantasy books, and have given up, so this one looked interesting to me.   The story was interesting and I got the feeling that I was learning something, but the characters seemed to be trying to be too cool to take a hint.  I think it would have been much better if the book had a good ending.  The characters were fun to read about, and did seem to change a lot from chapter to chapter.  My problem is that the story ends abruptly after the third or fourth book.  This is a short book so you don't get to the ending that much.  It's not a bad story, just not great.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a terrible book. The plot is stupid and the characters are terrible. The characters are also stupid, they think they are saving the world from a zombie apocalypse. Then they have an outbreak and the zombies attack, so they decide to just shoot the whole lot. The author was going to write a different type of book with a much better ending but decided to publish this one instead. The ending was also really cheesy. The book ends at the most anticlimactic possible point and leaves no hope in the reader that this book will be any good. I would not recommend this to any reader. It is not a good book, and the author should go back to high school and take a good science class.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first got this book I was excited because I love the movie and this is the only book I've read so far that really captures the spirit of it!   The book follows Sam Malone, who is from a poor family and a criminal record. He is sent to prison for a robbery but escapes and manages to find a way to escape with help from a girl who is his friend. The only problem is that he has to run from a man with a gun in the desert.   And the book starts off great, with Sam figuring out that he can use his hands to hold on to the rocks on which he is hiding and then to swing them to throw rocks back at the man with the gun.  The problem is it just gets worse and worse.  First, you have Sam running away from the police with a girl he's got an affair with, and she seems to be doing more than just sitting around waiting to be rescued.   And then you have the whole "running away from an angry mob" thing.  And by "angry mob", I mean one of them is a drunk/bully who's looking for someone to beat up so he can "beat him down" with the police in tow.  But that's not enough.  After the "anger mob" scene, Sam has to save a group of people from a mob of wild boars, and then a wolf, then a man, then an eagle, then some animals.  He finally gets into a fight with a bear, but I won't spoil it.  Eventually Sam and the wild boar all make it back to the house where he's staying, but a bunch of animals are coming for them.  Sam's life doesn't get better, not by a long shot.  This book is one of those where you're just waiting for the next chapter, but you don't want to give up because you're already so tired of it. But the writing is so bad that I actually hated the ending.  I love movies, so I can imagine that the writing style of the movie was more fun to read, but in the book there's so much repetition that you're supposed to feel the tension build and then it just goes "ooh" and "aah" like a broken record.  Even the "oh" sound is the same.   I guess I'd call this book a train wreck, but even that might be too harsh
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book a lot, but unfortunately the ending really took me out. It was a nice start to a new series, though, and it's always good to get another set of stories from the main characters. I'll definitely be giving this one a good read.  43 of 45 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had this book for many years before giving it up.   For me, it's not so much a disappointment as a disappointment of a different kind. I don't know that I enjoyed it at all.  When I was young, I was fascinated by a book called the Old Man And The Sea.  It was about a man who was given a small boat by his father.  The father used it for fishing and it had a very poor engine.  He was supposed to sail back to the family, but he only went out a few times before deciding to return to the sea.  This book was basically about the father's failure to follow his father's footsteps and finally get back to what he grew up with.  I read this as a young boy but that was a decade or two before it came out.  Then one day a very dear friend of mine showed me a copy of it.  She told me it was her father's favorite book but when I asked her if I should get it, she said "no."  I couldn't put it down.  It seemed so much more real then.  And I read a lot of books as a kid.  So in a way, I still like the book a lot.  But it's a bit hard for me to put down. But what bothers me about it is that even though I wanted to read it as a child, I knew at the time that my family wasn't going to buy it. I'd heard of it from my friend but I didn't know what to expect from it. It seemed like a fun book but what I got was a book that was kind of a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a piece of shit.   It's an excuse for a person to tell you how to live your life, but you will be much better off following the example of the women in the story.  This book is awful! I hate this book.  I have so much more respect for those who have been successful in life than this pathetic little person!  I had to put it down and re-read it 2 times in a row in order to write this review.  Why? I have read far better books in the same genre and I could not put this down once I started reading. It's a complete and total failure!   You read what you want to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed.   This is one of those books which seems really great on the surface, but is really bad at its core, or rather one that is really, really good at its worst.  It's really interesting to me that when people get turned on by stories of rape they will generally find that the sexual parts are not as intense or interesting as they would hope.  I found this book to be just about as good as a rape story is supposed to be, but the rape stuff never came across as very interesting.  The "climax" of the story was interesting, but I couldn't help but feel that she was just using it as a means to make the sex scenes even more intense, so it wouldn't be as gratuitous as rape is.  Again, that's just a nitpick, but if I'm going to use rape to make rape even more interesting, I'd rather try to make it more interesting and interesting at the same time rather than just using rape to turn everything else into a rape scene.  But that being said, this book does have a lot of good ideas:    the story of how we form sexual fantasies is really interesting,   and the idea that people may just not be able to understand that sexual experiences are "different" (the main character has no problem with being with a person she finds attractive, but she finds the feeling that it's her fault if the other person doesn't find her attractive, even though she wasn't the one who chose the person to be with) is a great idea, especially since that's one that I know a lot more people can relate to.  A lot of the other ideas in this book, like people making sexual decisions in an "abnormal" way,  and people not being able to feel sexual attraction, or being able "forget" sexual attraction when it's gone,  aren't as far fetched as those.  But they are still ideas worth exploring.  Rating:  The Good:  (a solid 3/5) The Bad:  I'd recommend this book:     The worldbuilding is really good in this one,  This is one you should read if:  To get off the couch and do some reading.    To read about people who have never really dealt with a situation of their own making. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   " I think this book is terrible! It has been used as a teaching tool and is full of errors. The professor used some bad research to make his point but then he got sloppy. It was like trying to learn calculus without taking calculus, he forgot the definition of an inverse tangent which is also a definition in the book, he used a confusing definition of "equation" (the one that gives a right triangle as a right angle) and he used his own definitions of "identity" and "inverse" but I just can't buy it. The math is correct, but the professor is a slob. " --TJ, Amazon.com user, January 2006  " "I just had the chance to read this book, and the teacher made a total mistake in using these definitions: in this case, the inverse tangency does not equal the inverse of the square root of two. However, it is easy enough to use to solve a whole lot of problems if you're not a math geek. " —A.H., Amazon.de user, February 2006 ... " "As a math teacher, I have always felt that the best way to learn a subject is to have someone else teach you. Not everyone understands the concepts, but it is so much more interesting to learn the concepts by reading the book than by sitting at the board with the student." —G.W., Amazon user, March 2006
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My only complaint is that the first four hundred pages were tedious.   I found myself reading the same two character chapters over and over.  It was a big waste of time.  The story had a twist halfway through, but then it kind of just became another character's POV chapter.  I felt I was seeing the same scenes over and OVER again.  To be honest I really didn't care about the characters that much.  They were just so one-dimensional, so the whole book felt like a set-up for the next book.  Unfortunately, the twists were more interesting than the characters, and this book did not live up to the hype.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to believe that this is only my second attempt to read this book. I have read many of the previous entries in the series. The previous entries had much more emotional impact than this book does.   The characters are dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   " This is a book that is poorly written and badly paced.    The plot is poorly put together, the characters are poorly developed and fleshed out, the dialog is poorly done, and the narrative is very slow.  "   My rating:  6/10 The only real issue I have with this book is that it is so bogged down with a poorly done plot.  I find the first 40-50 pages really boring.  The story really gets going at chapter 40, but it doesn't pick up steam until chapter 47.  To be fair, the book has only 2/3 of its run time covered so there is no reason for the pacing to be that slow.   The book is also very slow-paced at times.  At least the plot isn't bad.   This book did not give me any enjoyment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a few bad reads in this book.   The premise is a good one, but the execution just wasn't there.  (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . There's a lot of stories that will just confuse and upset you, and that's just not a good way to learn. This book will only give you a very brief summary of an aspect of the story and let you know that the characters are a little bit off. I found it a little frustrating that so much of the book was in the first person (which I find very distracting). It doesn't help that the authors didn't really try to make the story seem interesting, and it felt a little boring, even though there was some good stuff going on. I was disappointed with the writing, which was pretty bad for the whole book, especially for a first novel.   I did not enjoy reading this book at all. It was confusing, boring, and just plain irritating. I am still trying to figure out the characters and story line, and I'm not sure why I did enjoy it, or if it was the writing. I don't think the author really tried. I hope you don't really like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first chapter is interesting, and a story that has been told. However, I cannot read on this book. I'm trying to finish it and, for the record, it's about how we use the brain to be right and wrong. Then it tells us that the brain can be changed. The author does not seem to have anything constructive to say. I am sorry, but there's just nothing to recommend this book to anyone. I wish that it was good. It doesn't seem to make much sense to me. It does have some very good quotes, but the book would have been better if the writer had not quoted himself at so many points. I got a good chuckle from reading this book because of the quote about the dog. This book isn't that bad and it's funny that it's so bad. I recommend this for the people that really like the brain. I also recommend it to those who need some entertainment. I found that I loved this book very much and I will continue to try to read books that have brain jokes. I will still be reading this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because my kids wanted a Christmas book. I am so glad I waited. I found it terribly boring and was disappointed in the writing. My youngest daughter had just finished reading the entire book when she said:  I found this book to be very boring and a disappointment. I liked reading this book for my kids but I would not recommend it for the youngest reader.  I am glad I purchased this book. It will be a great Christmas gift for them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really loved this book. It had the right feel to it and I'm so happy to be able to read this story. A great ending. One of the coolest ideas I've read in a while. The book is set in the same universe as Harry Potter which is always nice. But I can't say I love Harry Potter because of this book because this book really changed my perspective on everything, from the Harry Potter universe to what it was like to live in my early 20's, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to get a better understanding of the HarryPotter universe or people who want to know what life is really like.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I read this book I knew it would have a bad ending.   I felt like I was cheated out of being the only one who read it and I didn't know if I should even bother trying to find a copy.  I've seen people rave about this book and other fantasy works.  It's not my favorite book and if you don't like fantasy and have never read one, this isn't the book for you.  If you love fantasy and want a nice read for a decent price, I recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is well paced and a bit clever at times. The setting and setting of the world are the only things I have a problem with. The characters are well made and the ending is sweet, but not really. The prose is very easy going and can be read in a couple of hours.   Recommended for fans of fantasy (and fans of the Wheel of Time)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This is a book of the worst kind: a book with an interesting plot, a nice idea, but no plot at all. The author thinks the best way to tell a tale is by making the protagonist a 'villain' (a bad guy) and then watching as the reader is left with the sense that the writer is the only one in the story who was not actually on the side of the villain." I found the plot and characters weak; the author's idea about being "the one who knows nothing" is somewhat amusing. The book is "A dark satire, set in a world dominated by the 'Black Arts'. The book, and the character, are highly entertaining and it is fun to see what kind of people the main character is going to become. The writing is clean, sharp and entertaining and a well-written and interesting world."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A collection of a series of books that has absolutely no chance of ever being a great read. It would have been better to publish them as a complete novella instead of making this hard-cover collection. The book is not bad; the book is bad. The author is good at keeping the characters alive and alive and still interesting in the stories they're telling. The writing is pretty bad and you have to give him a lot of credit for that. The art is pretty good and the cover is fine. It has some good moments in it and some great moments in the bad moments. The overall story is pretty mediocre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in a couple days. At first, I felt disappointed and put off by the author's claims to know what he was talking about. But then, I got a little interested, which I guess is what one's looking for when one's reading a book like this. The author uses a wide variety of examples, but he seems to base his conclusions on one or two of them. There was the guy who's just started playing soccer who asked his parents for a new, less expensive soccer ball and his parents refused him, but they provided the ball for free to the poor, elderly man who wanted to play soccer for a while before his knee gives out.   And I had my own mom who, despite knowing how to play the piano, would rather play the violin rather than play soccer.  As far as the book's conclusion, I think it's good that it doesn't provide a perfect solution to all of life's problems.  But if you are interested in learning about a few interesting ways to improve your life, it is a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book as a "good" way to pass an afternoon or "goodbye" to the end of school. However, I don't recommend this book to children because the illustrations are so terrible and it is so hard to read. In fact, I had to force myself to finish the book because I had a hard time staying focused and I was embarrassed by it. I am sure it is meant for adults who do not want to "waste" time on a bad read but I personally find it really embarrassing. I would advise anyone who buys this book and is looking for something to "just read" to look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The reason I gave this book a 2 star rating is because of the cover. The artwork for this book is simply terrible. The characters and setting are all drawn in a style that is a bit old school, but they do have a decent amount of detail. The book, however, is a lot less attractive. The plot is somewhat interesting, but the book does not do much more than try to be like a Stephen King novel, but with less sex and more horror. I did like that some of the other books in this series were written by the same author as this one, but I would never read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a waste of time.   The story takes so much time to tell and all you have to do is wait for the conclusion.  This book should have been shorter so that it would have been easier to get through.  What I would do if I had to read this book again is put it down, take a shower and try to forget about it all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book I'm reviewing today is called "Love, Sex & Death". It was written by my friend Richard Price. If you read this review, then you already know how good this book is. If not, then it's about a couple who's marriage is on the rocks. After their marriage is strained, they decide to try a new idea, a "solo sex affair". What could go wrong? The result? They both die of a heart attack when she gets too excited and has sex with a stranger she's just met.   So it turns out that Richard Price is a man who has written some of the best books I've ever read. I can't put a rating for this book because the ending left me as baffled as Richard Price: "It turns out what we thought was a good idea when we planned it out was never the thing we meant to have happen. It's a little more complicated than a one-time-only "casual sex" affair that works for a few weeks or a week or a couple of months... and I suspect that we are not alone in our own feelings of confusion at not knowing what we meant when we wrote the book in the first place."   He's a great writer and I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in being in a committed relationship. Price's writing is clear, he does not make himself a hero nor does he portray himself as an oversexed man. He treats his characters with respect and even has one character in the book say the line "I'm just having sex."  If you want to learn more about relationships, then I recommend you read his books "My Wife is My Ex" and "Love is a Many Splintered Thing." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My expectations went up a notch, but not by enough to justify the book.   I didn't want to give up on a good book as soon as I finished it, so I stuck around and read to the end.  The first half was interesting, and the second half (a big chunk of the book) got tedious.  And, my expectations of the last part went to pot as well, so it took me a while to get to the bottom of what was going on.  "This is the story of a man who travels to the heart of the woods to see if his theory about a dangerous animal called a moose being out there is true."  This part was the one I was looking forward to most of all.  "He thought it was possible he had made a mistake, or maybe he just had an unusually high opinion of himself. He wanted to prove that the moose was real, or at least that he had spotted one in the wild and written about it."  The rest of the novel...   The writing style is a little bit stiff and stilted.    It is very clear that the author likes to tell a story and not let the facts get in the way.  To me, the "plot" didn't matter all that much, since the characters are more interesting and their motivations and decisions made the story.  I will say that, at times, the author seems to be putting a little too much emphasis on how cool the animals look.  It would have been nice to read a few pages more about how cool a moosen is, or how cool an elk is.  At least the "suspects" seemed to have a better chance at being right, compared to the characters.  Also, a few times, I had to take a look up at the characters to make sure they weren't really the suspects.  They were definitely more interesting than the moosen, but I would have preferred them to have more focus.  However, I'm glad that I read the book, because the author does have the ability to make a story out of pretty much anything.  Even a "stiff and stilt" writing style was able to make me care about a lot of the characters, and it's not like the moosens could even be killed off. Why it wasn't a five-star:   While the characters were more interesting, they were also less like
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to read this book. The synopsis really did it for me. It looked so great and the first 5 or so pages sounded interesting enough. The rest is like one of those "weird" stories you might read on a plane. A girl moves in next door to a guy named Joe who keeps having sex with her mother, she gets all worked up, they have a falling out, she makes a bunch of accusations and he defends himself by saying that her mother was a crack addict (which the author actually said). The book is about her having to go to the police and report him as a sex offender, which is where I gave up on it. I never really got a true sense of this story. The main character didn't seem all that interesting or relatable either. I think her story was just that one in a million. I did like the author's use of a "tongue twister" that I think is hilarious and would be a great addition to a movie. It's a shame that this is the first book I've read by this author that I'm actually disappointed in.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    As for the book itself I think I'm in the minority on this. I actually found this book a bit difficult to understand and quite often it felt like it didn't have any idea about what it was trying to say. I'm a long time fan of science fiction but I'm not sure that I would read this book again. It could have been improved by at least slightly including some basic science.  I got the audiobook of this book by Audible.com's free membership program. The download is about 7.7 GB. I got the free audiobook version and I had no problems with it at all. I would definitely recommend this book to any kind of science-fiction fan.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So, when I started this book, I was expecting a good read. The plot is a very good read, and the characters are well drawn. However, there is a problem with this book. The author, John B. McLemore, starts off his story with a very short paragraph about how he plans to write the story for his future work, only to jump right into it. I know this is the way many writers plan their stories, but this should have been a big warning. I've read other stories like this, where the author has a very small focus in the beginning of the story, but they are well written and interesting. I'd be really interested in reading more from McLemory, but unfortunately, he's already started another project, so I won't be buying this book anymore. I think this is a great short book. If you like science fiction or just good sci-fi, you should give this a read. It's just the right length for someone to get something out of, and get a kick out of.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to admit that I was hesitant to read this book, as I've read reviews about how poorly written the novel is.   However, I am glad I read this. I'm not sure if it's just me, or the way this book is written, but there's a clear sense of characters and plot from beginning to end.  I'm glad to have a good book out, although my first impressions of the novel may have been negative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, but I am sure I will not enjoy reading another book with so many errors and problems. I don't read many books, and this is one of the few I did not like.   The story is told from the point of view of a girl, in this case a girl's point of views. She is a young boy and she has been kidnapped by the King of the land and she is told that the reason she has come here is because he is taking her back to her country to be a wife to his son. She was kidnapped when she was eight and her mother has been taken to a different country. The King then takes his son away from her and he doesn't allow her to go back because she is a boy. This is what the King wants for her to be his wife because the boy is his son's father. After she is taken back home she learns that she will be his only bride, as she is of an age that her mother could not be his bride. After learning of this she wants to go with him and she tries to do this as a boy, but the King says that it will not be allowed. She doesn't understand why he says that. He also tells her to never tell anyone about his love for her. When they are both kidnapped again, the girl wants to try to fight her captor because she wants him to allow her brother to stay with them. He said that it is his fault that his brother is taken. Her brother is a princess and the King loves her and that's why he will let his brother stay. This was not the first time he has been captured so he knows what to do and he takes the princess to the castle. This girl does not have a brother so her father doesn't want to let him go back, but he also doesn't really want to take his brother because he doesn.  It was confusing to me to have this boy in this girl's body. I felt like he would just do whatever she said. He did not show any of his emotions or feelings when she told him to leave and he said he wanted to. He is the King's son and when the girl was kidnapped by him he wanted the girl to be the one to stay and marry his son, but she had never even been on a ship and he told her that she wasn't a boy and he wanted a princess.  This made it even more confusing that the girl could not go
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's an okay book that's very much worth reading, but I just don't have any interest in it.   The premise is a little lame, but the characters are fun and the narrative is interesting enough to keep me interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of fantasy, and in particular, the genre of the epic fantasy. However, the first book I read in this series was a very unmemorable piece of work. This was disappointing, because I really did expect a lot from this book. However this isn't the first time I have had problems with this series.  The first book in the series, the Lord of Chaos, had an epic battle that took me completely by surprise, and made me feel like I was watching a movie.   This battle felt more like a chess match or a battle on an arena than an epic fantasy battle, and the last chapter felt like a bad episode from a bad series (I couldn't quite put my finger on it but it seemed like a filler episode, or a throwaway episode to set up the next book).   My expectations for this book were low, but I wanted to be excited because I love the series and because I've been waiting for the next installment to come out.  However, this book did not live up to my high expectations.  I found it very lackluster, and was disappointed because there were great battles, and plot twists that I didn't see coming. There were a lot of issues with this book, so I have to say it's a complete failure.  It's unfortunate that there were so many problems in this book because the plot was great. I would have loved a new hero for this epic battle. It's a shame the book failed because of all the excitement it created. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book doesn't go anywhere (I never got to read a whole book). The story itself is not really that interesting, so the book just became an exercise in repeating the same "cliches" over and over (though I do think it's an interesting way to describe the experience of the mind and the mind's relationship to the body). I would definitely get this book in a different format, perhaps a journal-style book. I have been a long time fan of the author's work, but this book is really bad. I did enjoy the book, but not so much as the last book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I was hoping to find the next great James Patterson story, and it wasn't until I read it that I realized that was not the case. The story is told in three parts, and the first half does not make any sense at all. There is no character development at all, and there are too many confusing aspects to the plot that make it very difficult to keep track. The second part of the book is also confusing. The characters are extremely stereotypical and the plot is not what I expected from a James Patterson book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been a waste of my time and money. I bought a hardcover edition about 4 months ago. I liked the author, and he has a way of getting his point across. However, this book is filled with bad writing, poorly constructed stories, poorly done plots, and poorly thought out characters. The worst is the character of the man who runs the inn. The beginning is interesting, as the man has no real motive for keeping the inn open. However as the story proceeds, the main character is only there for the money. Then, after the events of the third book, it turns out he was just running the inn and not the man at all. And then there's the man's wife. The wife is interesting in that she tries to make sense of the strange circumstances around the inn, but she's not a very good writer and really does not have a good character at all for the most part. The plot really doesn't have a clear direction and a lot of characters do not make much sense. I think a lot more effort could have been put into developing the story rather than a plot that seemed to be written so long ago. Overall, I felt cheated, and the book is only 4/5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I am completely blown away by this book. This book is so unique it's kind of amazing. I've never heard of anything like it, but I can't wait to read it. This is a MUST read for fans of science fiction." –Michael J. P.  "This book has the most brilliant and original premise ever for a science fiction novel. It's a book you want to read at 3am on a cold winter night. And even though I like a lot of other people's books, I have to say that this book had to be one of the best, if not the best novel I've read so far in 2014." –James T. Kirk  "[I] found [this novel] to be a very well constructed tale that, by the end, left me with many questions. It also left me wanting more. The next time I sit down to read, I am going to be reading this book again." –Drew K. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a really long book and I would have been much better off with one of the shorter books of the series.   The characters are mostly forgettable and there is very little action.  The world building and history are also poorly described.  I had hoped that the series would have developed the characters and had them do more than just fight and kill.  My son (who is in Grade 2 and is already a huge Star Wars fan) really enjoyed the series and I have already begun reading the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a fantastic book and has a wonderful premise that is executed flawlessly. The characters are richly detailed and well drawn, and are a joy to read.   The writing is witty, witty, and often times snarky.  And the story is well paced and well-written.  The only negative I could find was the pacing. While the first half was really good (it builds up to a really great cliffhanger), it started to drag by the end of it.  This book is definitely one to keep an eye out for in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing style was awful.  I felt like the author wasn't very knowledgeable about the genre she was writing in or the genre in which she wanted to write, but was determined to be successful because that is how the world works.   One of the main characters, a character we've never heard of, is a bad person.  The ending left me a little disappointed that we didn't get a little bit more about her backstory, but then I thought that was a good thing because this is the kind of book I would love to read.  The final rating for this book is a 3 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible.   It's a pretty standard spy story that starts with the CIA tracking down a suspect's (or is it a spy's?) family, and then the CIA interrogates the family to find out whether the suspect is the spy, or a spy.   This book is a great example of why I hate spy novels.  The reason they are bad is because of the lack of any realistic espionage tactics, and the lack and lack of real tension.  As a matter of fact, the story does not even have any "action" until halfway through the book, which is ridiculous considering the main characters are working undercover. I'm not even kidding.  This plot line is pretty typical and boring.  In fact, it's so dull that I have to say that it is one of the worst spy novels I have ever read.  That's not to say there is anything wrong with this book--it is just not as good as the rest.  I also have no idea why this author keeps putting out books.  Why does she keep putting out a novel that is as boring as this one?  Why can't she just stop writing these awful novels?  Recommendation:  I would recommend this book to anyone who reads spy novels and loves the idea of working undercover, but doesn't like the writing or the plot.  You may want to skip this book if you hate spy plots and want to read something interesting.  4.4 out of 5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   " I'm reading my way through this to find out the story. This is an interesting read, but I feel a little bit underwhelmed. It's really easy to see why this author's work has gotten so much attention. It doesn't require a lot of brainpower to understand. In fact, I have a hard time even figuring out what the book's story is about. It seems very much like a story from a storybook. There are a lot more words in this book than a story requires and most of them are either irrelevant or not used in a way that makes any sense at all. I'm really confused and I can't figure out how this story is supposed to make sense if the author is using so few words and still writing a story. "  More than anything, I was disappointed in how much I could understand of this story (and I have heard that many people have been turned off by the book and even my own reviews).  And yes, I understand that many have had a positive experience reading it but it is not something I'm interested in reading again.  In short, the story is too easy to understand for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book, but then the bad parts came into play. I got a sense that if it were a series it would have been more interesting to follow the other books in the series, but since it's a standalone I would have liked to have had the option of reading this one later. There was a lot of detail about her father and how she felt she'd been abused as a child. The author's intent was good, but as an author she should have done better at getting me interested in the story instead of being so obsessed with this one character. The main issue is that the story didn't really make me think "Wow I wish I could have read more about this person." I had no interest in seeing her character grow or develop.   This is one of those books that is so good I want to keep reading it just to know the end, but I have a feeling I won't because the ending was so disappointing. The characters are interesting and interesting characters don't necessarily make a great story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book.   I was hoping that this one would be a good one. But it was so disappointing! I liked that the writing style was like a younger version of Tolkien, but the story just wasn't there. The world building was good, but nothing really came together to make a compelling story. I will never read this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is my least favorite novel of the series. When you start the series, you are in for a shock because we are told that Harry's best friend is a giant, he will die at the end of the book and we can go back and read the other four books before the final book and see how Harry's friends turn out. The writing is horrible and the plot is terrible. The only reason I finished the series is because I was so invested in Harry's friendship with Ron that I read the books out of order. I would never recommend this to any of my friends.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had to pick the worst book I've ever read, this would probably be it. It's a story about a girl that was abused by her parents and the two best friends that try to comfort her. The writing is nothing special, and the characters are shallow and unfunny. The worst part is the plot which is just a bunch of bad and unoriginal ideas.   "A few minutes after she'd walked in the door, it was like she had been there all her life, all by herself." That's how I heard it. The only thing good in this book is the ending where she finds her true love.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1) A poorly written book about an ancient religion which is now considered to be superstitious. 2) It makes the point that the world has changed in the last few centuries, and that people must understand that religion is no longer the answer to life's problems, and if you still need a religion to explain life's mysteries, then you are a fool. 3) It does not discuss why and how religion became associated with superstition (which is actually a separate issue). This is a real shame, because the author seems to know a lot about the subject. 4) It doesn't go into the history of Christianity. I guess that's not important, but the author does make the point on page 15 of the back cover that the word "Christian" was originally a derogatory term. I think that's a fair statement, but I will add my own observation that the title, "The Golden Bough," was used by Christians as a derogatory moniker for Christians because they felt they were being "scoffed" by the pagans about the supposed inspiration of the Bible. So, yes, this book contains a lot of truth and wisdom. However, it lacks in the area of how the world is now. If you want to learn how to live your life, then read a book like, say, "How to Live the Good Life." But, if you want a good book to "get" a bad idea about how religion is an answer to most life's ills, then "The Lost Religion of Ancient Egypt" may be the book for you. This book was purchased with my own money from a bookshop.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -The description on the dust jacket of this book does not convey the horror, terror, horror, horror of this novel, which is about the aftermath of a horrible accident. The book, despite being about a horrific accident, contains no realistic characters, no real gore, and no actual blood. I found the book to be somewhat disappointing, as I really hoped to read something different from the usual "blood, guts, sex, and violence" genre. If you don't like gore, or you have a hard time with a novel that contains no gore, this one may not be for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One thing I hated about this book is that it is a compilation of different books about people who have done things wrong in the past.   It makes it seem like there is this endless series of stories about people's bad choices.  This, however, was actually not the case at all.  I enjoyed the different stories of other people who made bad choices, but not the stories about the bad choices of this author.  Instead, the author focused on telling people that they are not bad, they are bad because of the choices they have made in the years leading up to this.  It made the book feel very preachy, very like the book of 1,000 rules, except that this author didn't say the 1,999 rules (they did).   I felt that this book could have used one or two chapters that were about how to be kind and gentle to others.  Other people's lives don't happen in the blink of an eye, so why do we spend our lives thinking that they can?   If people had different ways of making choices in different times in their lives, that would help us to better understand the different ways we make choices.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the end, I feel that it does a great disservice to the book by not giving a full and truthful review of the book's main ideas and concepts.   I love the book, but I do not love the concept of the entire book.  I will give it an 8 because it contains some great ideas about how society should be organized and it contains good writing. I also appreciate the honesty that the author brings to the subject of child abuse.  In an effort to educate and inform readers, he gives his opinion on the subject.  It's a great topic and a worthy subject for writing about, but in this case the writer went too far.  A few of the more difficult and complicated ideas have been dropped in favor of a more simplistic statement about the author's views on abuse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My book was very boring. I think that is because this is not a bad novel. It is just not very interesting. Not even a bad story. The plot was boring and uninteresting. It just wasn't that good. The characters were bland. The writing was lame. I am not even going to discuss the ending which was a bad idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this book but was disappointed in it. The premise of the book is that we're all being manipulated into a massive scam to be used as a "gift" to be "wounded" and used to create a "peace treaty" with the "dreadful" "evil" "demon" they all refer to as "the dragon". The "gifts" they are given are based on some of their best traits and are very "bronze spoon", like a nice little meal at the end of a long journey. We're told a lot of things that make it seem like these people have some great qualities but there's really no substance in the story to back it up. The story seems very rushed and just as a good fiction, there is a huge amount of false information thrown around, not to mention a few "out of this world" elements thrown in. The main character is a little odd and his dialogue doesn't really make sense. Also, the world building is pretty shallow and doesn't make any sense either.   My final score is a 2/10    Overall I really enjoyed the book. I'm really interested in what will come out from this, but I do think it's going to be one of those books that is just going to get a really bad review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm really disappointed in this book.   The characters are bland and the plot is completely predictable.  There is almost nothing interesting about the story other than a bit of romance between a man and his pet.  The book takes forever to finish, but by then you don't care because you already know what the characters are going to do.  I will not be purchasing this book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . My favorite part of this book is the introduction. The author discusses a number of historical instances of the term "wickedest woman in the world". The list is lengthy and the book does not get in the "witches" part of the list for me. The introduction is a solid primer on the history of the wickedest woman. But the author seems to be trying to outdo herself. It is very hard to describe one wicked woman but when you meet her she is no different from all the others. She is just a wicked woman. The book could have benefited from more time spent on the origins of the word "witch" and how it was used in the Americas. This book contains a lot of information. The subject matter is fascinating and the author is well researched. I would recommend it to anyone who likes history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was about a small town in the middle of a desert, in the 70s when everything was going south. I liked the book, but was disappointed at the end with an epilogue. In fact, the only real good part of the book was the epilog which was an interesting look at why the town fell apart in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a book snob.   The plot was so cliché that I didn.t care that it's not a real historical account of one of the most tragic events of the 20th century.  It was so badly written that I had trouble getting into it.  I couldn't understand how anyone could give this book a 4/5.  For that matter, my rating was based on the book.     It is not so much a book as it is a collection of quotes.  This book is so full of quotes that it seems like the book is just a collection to try and fill space.  The quotes are taken from the book " The Last of the Mohicans," which I found in the library.  So it's basically a book review of what it's like to be a Mohican kid in the 1880's.  Unfortunately, I found that it was basically the book with the same exact quotes. So that's bad.  To quote the book description: The Last Of The Mohicans. is a gripping account of the struggles that the Mohawks of New York endured as they stood up against the American settlers, and finally found their place in the world....  And I find it a little annoying how they take quotes from the Mohican Wars (the Mohicans fought against the colonists who were trying to take their lands) and then put them on the cover and title the book this book "The Mohicans: The First 100 Years."   This is kind of insulting because it takes the time and effort to read the actual Mohican War (which is a book in itself) and yet they just slap a quote on the front.  They probably thought, "Well, Mohicans are so cool, we can use their quotes."  They should read the Mohish War (or the other Mohican wars) before they start with the Mohic Wars.  And even then, it's a very small book and very rushed. The plot? It is very predictable and one big action scene after another. There are also a lot of random references to other books and books of the time. For instance, in the first act, one of those quotes is from "The Last of The Mohics," and a little later, it is "The Devil's Dictionary" and they do the same thing.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the author could
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not want to start this book. I'm sure that you are familiar with all the bad things that are written about books, and this one seemed to me to be bad all around. I was looking for a book about the occult, and I came across this. I have been doing my research on all things occult, as there is some very interesting occult stuff out there. I also read this book with the intent of reading about a very specific part of occultic teachings, and that is the creation of a "symbol," in the form of an object. The symbolism in this book seems to be a bit of a hodgepodge of different types of symbols and concepts. I found it interesting that the author is also involved in a group called the Ordo Templi Orientis. In reading a few reviews, I found that there are some people who think this book is bad, and there are people who actually like it. I am going to give it a 4/5 because I will be reading it again. I really enjoyed this book, and if you have a particular interest in the occult I think this might be a good choice for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was like walking into a horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good read, except the characters are awful. I can't stand them and the way they're drawn. They've got nothing going on except the "magic" of "I love him, I love him" and "I hope this will work out", it just doesn't work that way and if you ask me to buy it I will probably get it, but the only way to read it is to say you just don't like the characters and to the end I can see why.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a fan of a certain television show (Star Trek: The Next Generation) that's aired since the 80s, I had high expectations for this book. The only disappointment I had was the fact that the story was not as good as I had hoped.   There were lots of science facts that were not very applicable to my problem (I'm a student in the engineering program at the time I got the book), so I ended up reading the information in a journal I'd kept for a year or so about the Star Trek universe.  After some research I discovered that there was a good show out that was airing right then, and that was Star Trek: Voyager (TNG). So I finally read the book, but it didn't feel like it lived up to the hype. The character development and the plot development was pretty weak, and the story felt like it was trying to do too much. The science part was very good, but I don't think it was as good or relevant as I was expecting.  I was really looking forward to reading it because I was hoping to see what they did with the science fiction in TNG, but unfortunately, they got the science part quite wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I read this book, I was expecting something completely different than what I got. It is not a horror novel, which is good because it is not bad at all. I am disappointed in this book because it was a great book. But, I did not enjoy it as much as I did it the first time around. That said, the book had a lot of good moments and it was actually quite good. It was not horrible like a lot some horror novels are. The story is amazing. The art is good. The narrator, who is very well done and does a great job in portraying the character, is really good. If you like horror, I suggest you give this a read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   "It's just boring."  —David S., Largo, Florida  Review: A good book about the history of science, and it's fun to read, even though the content is too dry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character in the novel has a problem with alcohol. This is the same book that was made famous as a book called, "It Takes A Village." The main point to this book is the "Village" concept, which is described as a group of people that is dependent on each other. The point to the story is that this person, who has become alcoholic, is the one who has to put on the "village" facade to keep the other members of his village from losing hope and eventually leading to complete disintegration of the entire village. I know that there are several books that have similar "Villages" concepts but, " It Takes a Village," seems to have been made to promote the concept. " It's a Village " is a bit different than most. While it is a story about the same concept, "Villagers" are not people who have turned their life around and are now "living the life of the mind." They are generally the same people who, before their "villager" status, had been alcoholic and/or drug addicted. "Villager" is used as a term that describes a type of person who lives the life based on their personal beliefs, and are considered to have a good "villain" persona. While many people have "Villains," I have found that the majority of "Villaged" are people that have been diagnosed with a disorder. It has been suggested to me that most of the people who come to my office for help in "Villaging" are those that have "Sociopathic Personality Disorder" (also called Narcissistic Personality Disorder or Bi-Polar Disorder) as well as people with other types of personalities disorders (such as Borderline Personality Disorder, Histrionic Personality Disorder etc). It has also been suggested that some individuals with an alcohol or drug addiction may seek help for the symptoms of their addiction.   I would not call the novel any kind of success, though it is an interesting read, as it does make an interesting case for the concept of "villages" and the concept that they provide an ideal environment for the people involved.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author is pretty smart and a good writer. But she is just an idiot when it comes to her own personal problems. If you're like me, you start off really happy to be pregnant and then you realize that your husband is just another one of those men with a "problem". Now, this doesn't make for a good story, but it makes for a decent book. It was not easy to read but it's not difficult either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I have been reading some books for some time, and I am generally quite happy with them. But this book is so bad that it made me cringe. It doesn't even try to explain itself. It just goes on a tangent about some 'ideas'. The ideas were not clear, and when you are reading a book about some kind of philosophy you expect to be able to understand some of it, but this book just makes you scratch your head. It is a shame because I really like the author. If you are looking for a quick read, then this is a book you should just read over and over again."  Review by : S.E.A.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst story ever. I just finished it and thought I was being suckered in, but that's a mistake. I was not, but I think I was.   I'm an adult, so my judgement isn't as good as it should be, but this story is about as poorly written as you can get. I guess it was supposed to be a humorous story with a dark twist. If it wasn't funny, I'd give it 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is good. But not quite good enough to be worth the time it takes to read it. If you want a good mystery, read something like Gone Girl. If a good suspense novel, read A Case of Conscience or The Talisman. But this book... well, I guess it's not that.   The most interesting thing about the story is a dead man's diary, and that's pretty much it.  It's not a bad story; the main character is flawed and the mystery doesn't come out too hard. But there's no plot. There's no development. It just happens in a random way.  In the beginning of the book, we're told, "She found a diary in the woods. The diary was of a man in his late 60s named Michael," and then we don't get a better description. It's sort of like when the narrator in the Twilight Zone episode describes a dead body, as if he wants to make us feel something: "His hands were crossed on his chest as he leaned on his cane for support. A dead-eyed look crossed his face."  And then we get a dead-eyes look at the end. And then the guy dies. The dead-eye is the most memorable part of the whole thing, and it's something we'd expect from the Twilight Zones.  One thing I thought was really interesting about this book was that this man's girlfriend said, "This is the first I've ever been allowed to read the diary."  I thought that was interesting. The way people react to dead-people is different from how they react to people who aren't dead.  I'm not sure if the "Diary" in the book is a reference to the mystery itself or if the author is just trying to be clever. The fact that the girl reads the diary and then the girl dies makes me think that the mystery has an ending.  This is a solid mystery novel, but not one that's worth the price.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to reading this book, but after finishing, I was disappointed in the lack of depth and the overall lack of character development. This is a pretty average book, which isn't always a bad thing, but it wasn't what I was expecting.    "I have been a member of this religion for many years, I have been involved in my parish since I was eight. I have loved the church since the very beginning."   -J. J. Gebhart, from his novel   "It is hard to find a more useless and worthless book than A Good Woman is, yet the booksellers keep trying to sell it as if it were some kind of spiritual guide. I suppose the book was intended to be a Christian novel, but I am glad I had not been involved with that group."   the book is basically a man's religious experience, but the story itself, despite being short, is very weak and unenjoyable.    There is a point in the story where it makes a lot of claims about the Church of the Final Judgment, but they are all just claims, and it's only the end that makes them believable. There's no real story to this book other than the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not a bad novel, but the author tried to make something out of nothing, and it comes across as a very rushed, sloppy writing.   The plot just... goes nowhere for the most part. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the book, but I could not finish it. It's too long. It has no interesting plot. The plot is just a long flashback. The characters don't even get development at all. It was very boring. I don't know who the author is, but if the book were shorter it would be much more enjoyable. The end is a complete cliffhanger. The ending has no meaning.    Review for the book: The first thing you need to know about me is that I have a thing for long books. The second thing I know about myself is that the best way to tell me that I'm really not ready to get the book finished is to say I finished the book in one day. I think that's a good way to measure how long the book is. I'm starting to see a pattern here, I hope you don't mind...I've been reading this novel in one sitting. So far, I have about 4 hours of uninterrupted reading time. I guess I'm a bit of a hoarder (maybe that's why I don,t have any bookcases, because I need more space to store the books?) Anyway, the good news: There are still at least a few pages left, maybe 15 or so, and the ending still makes sense. There were several places that I didn't quite understand or think about, but the author pointed them out. A few places were confusing or hard to understand at first, but after I read about it, I got it. My only real complaint is that it's so long, I need to split it into two books. I'll probably finish a chapter or two each night and do the next chapter after that. I can read all the way to the end on a good night's sleep. The only reason I didn.t finish the book earlier is because I was working full time for the last few months and didn't have time to read a book twice, let alone a whole book. Also, the next book will be called "The Night of the Long Knives."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is just so bad. My son read it and said the author said to read the books that were bad and get better. I took her advice and read the book. Not good. The plot is just lame. The characters are flat. The story is bad. The pacing is bad and the character development is just terrible. The book could have been a whole lot better. This is a book I cannot recommend to anyone. This book made me cry at points and I did not feel like I was in love with the characters. The author should be ashamed of herself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I love the way it started out, the way the characters were set up. The characters are nice, the setting is neat, I was really looking forward to this book! Unfortunately it's a huge let down from the start. It starts out really great, it's set in the world of the story, the worldbuilding is great, the main character is cute, we learn a little bit about his life, the story is good! Then it's all downhill from there. The story doesn't start out well. It's not a bad story by any means, it just has a bad beginning and it didn't have a good ending to it. For the first ten-15 pages the story does a good job setting up the setting and the characters, but then it starts falling back and it's basically the same thing every time. The pacing is bad, the dialogue is bad. Everything about this book was bad. From the opening pages of the book, which are basically plot holes, and then the beginning chapters where it takes a while for the plot to really kick in and the story to get going. There are so many plot holes in this book that the reader literally can't even believe that these are supposed to be a "science fiction" book. And that's just the beginning of it. After the first chapter it starts being pretty bad. The writing becomes very clunky, the characters are not developed or written as well as the setting. Then there's the plot holes. Like, all of them. So many. And then there's this really stupid thing where one of the characters says that he can see ghosts. The author has stated that his idea for this book is to set a story in a future where they are able to see ghosts (yes, ghosts actually can be seen), so he should have made it clear that this character can't see ghosts, right? So then, how come he doesn't see any ghosts? That's not going to get you any ghosts. Or did he? Then there is the whole ghost thing. So the character goes on and on about ghosts and then suddenly he says that his character is able to understand a spirit. This is so silly. But that's not all. So then the story takes a turn and it turns into a totally different type of story. The plot holes start popping out one after another and you realize that this book never had a good plot, it had a very poorly written plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of the book was fun. It started out with a nice, fast-paced story about the first encounter of the titular heroes, an alien species known as the Vorta. I liked the writing style. I found it fun, funny and interesting. There were a couple of points of concern though. One of them was the character of Vortar, who I found to be a little dull, especially once we found out that the Vorts are actually reptilian aliens who are bent on world domination. The other point was the Vors, the Vosians, who were the main antagonists of the story, the race that was actually trying to conquer Earth. For the first half, Vortarr and his buddies were engaging and likable characters. I could see why they would be interested in the Vor's plans. I just felt they were a little too generic. They weren't interesting characters. When they were on Earth, however, they were interesting enough. For me, the book finished with a cliffhanger (which I didn't mind so much, it made me hope for another book), and that was that. The main characters are interesting, but they're far too predictable. If I wanted to read a book set in the Star Wars universe, I'd probably want something with a bit more depth to the universe than this book did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is terrible and the characters are just annoying.   This book is really bad at anything.  In other reviews I found out that it is supposed to be about a scientist (who is also a ghost) that meets a woman who claims to be dead.  She tells the ghost that she can talk to him and he starts telling his experiences. This book does NOT HAVE ANYTHING to do with ghosts.  This is just the usual ghost story that has ghost with the scientist.  I really wanted to like this book.  Unfortunately it's just really bad.  I read this book in about 4 days because I'm really desperate for some good ghost/science books that I can get through the winter.  My only problem with this book was the fact that it had lots of paranormal/paranormal references and didn't give much information on how it relates to ghosts. I will admit that it DID include ghost references, but not as many as I expected.  The reason why this book didn't get a five star is because the ending was just so stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing in this book is just pathetic. It's so bad that the author is trying to make her name as a great writer who can write the greatest bad book in the world, but she fails to realize that people don't read her books because of the quality, they read them because of what they're supposed to be about (her feelings). If she can write a book like this, she'd be able to write about almost anything. The only reason this book gets 2 stars is because I really did enjoy it, but there's no way the author can write like this and write good books at the same time.  6 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on a train back home from England.   The plot seemed familiar, but it turned out that the writer (who is clearly a talented writer) had not read any of the classic science fiction novels.  In the beginning of the book the writer says:  "When I was a boy, my father loved to tell me stories about aliens. His stories were full of fantasy and wonder, and they always contained a kernel of truth. But sometimes, the stories got so close to the truth, that I wondered if they weren't actually telling me something wrong."  I found the writing as poor as the plot. The writer is so focused on making the reader think he is "telling" the reader a good story that he completely misses the mark and is in fact "telling you a lie."   There are several good stories in this book, but they are all too one-dimensional to be considered science fiction. The best stories are all about people on opposite sides of a conflict, not necessarily fighting with each other.  The characterizations are just plain bad. The main character is a "puppet" and has a bad attitude about "the world," yet is the "hero" of the story. When the book ends, the main character feels like he didn't "win."  The author also makes the author's mother look like a child abuser because he never tells her the truth about her.  This is a well written story, but not "good" science fiction, even though the plot is interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     If you haven't read the books or seen the movie "Terminator", you might get very angry. If you are not a fan of the Terminator franchise, or Arnold's acting skills, then this book might not be for you.   So, the story:  A few years ago, a mysterious woman who looks a lot like Sarah Connor was rescued from a terrorist group. The woman is a genius, who developed a highly sophisticated AI program and used it to destroy the terrorists and to create a world where robots are free. The terrorist group tried to kill her, but the AI program was able to find a way to destroy all the terrorists in the world. The terrorists, being smart, figured that they could figure out the way to defeat the AI so that they couldn't be used.  The terrorists had found a way, but they also have a huge problem. They have to find the person in the computer that is controlling the AI to stop it from destroying the world, and the person is on a boat with an AI that is programmed to give them information about the man inside.   He's called "Arnold Schwarzenegger". Arnold doesn't really know who he is, but he knows that his program is very important to the terrorist group, so he goes out to find him. .    But, it turns out that the terrorists are just using the AI. Arnold had used the AI in order to kill the terrorists, so, he now wants revenge on them. , Arnold does what he did with the terrorists: he has the computer destroy all of them. Unfortunately, it doesn't work because the terrorist AI has no other way to get information, so the man on the boat is actually giving it all the information about Arnold. When the man finds out, he gives the AI all the info that Arnold needs so that it can destroy the terrorist terrorist group once and for all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor book, and a poor book with little substance.   The book was so good that I just can't seem to get through it.   While there are many great stories, the stories from the perspective of the protagonists were the least interesting.   For example, there is a story in which a man tries to sell his wife a house but she finds the house to be so dangerous and overpriced that she decides to leave her husband, which then leads to the main character having to go out and find a new wife.   My main problem with the book is that there was really nothing about the characters' lives outside the story other than their relationships.  In one story, a man and woman meet at a party, but the woman's husband doesn't want to be in a relationship with her because she doesn't like her brother (also a guy), and in another, the father of the main characters is in a car accident which leaves him paralyzed and unable to care for his wife and two young children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - This book was extremely boring, and the author didn't even try to make it interesting. I had to reread the entire thing three times just to remember where all the details are.    A short review: The book describes some historical and philosophical ideas. The only real interesting ideas I see are that humans have an instinctive desire to connect with others, and that the human psyche is shaped by the social environment.  I am glad that I read this book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the idea of connectedness in modern society. I learned a few interesting ideas too, which is something!    - I had some expectations going in to this book. I was going to love it, but I really didn't. The book seemed like a lot of material for a very short book. The author seemed to be trying to explain all of the ways that humans relate to each other but then never really managed to go deep enough in some of the issues to really make the book interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I did not want to hate this book but there are so many bad reviews about this book I just had to give it a try."   This is an incredible book that makes you think about all the bad things we can do while living in this world.    First off, this book is not written in the voice of a parent. This is a book that shows you how bad life can be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author's personal problems are the book's most important plot points. The protagonist's struggle to make sense of and manage his feelings about those problems is the book itself. The book is basically a very bad-ass version of the classic novel, Pride and Prejudice. This is a very good, not great, book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . The last three or four books I've read from her have been very good, which is a relief, since the first two were not. The plot is just fine for the most part. The world building is good, the magic is cool, the world building works to keep the characters in the same realm and to introduce new magic elements. The main problem I have is the characters. I liked many of the characters, but I didn't like Vella.   I hate it when there are two good POV characters, and it's especially bad when they're both the POV protagonist. It makes it hard to care for one, and especially when it's a female POV.      A very interesting concept but with too much fanfare: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are not a fan of sci fi/fantasy then stay away from this book. It's not bad. Its just not what I expected out of a book that was $16.99. The plot is a bit too simplistic, and is not very compelling. The story is good, but i feel it needed more. The characters were too flat. The setting is not so good, and the language and the prose could have been improved. My wife and i really enjoyed it, but it didn't work for me. I think it's worth the purchase and would recommend this one to anyone who enjoys a good book. Just be aware, if you don't like the genre, this book might not appeal to you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book from Goodreads, and the book was fantastic. It was like a great story, with the story's themes and characters in a way that made it much more than just a "silly" fic. This was the first time that I've read a book with such a well written, well paced, and well done story that was also quite deep. It did the job to me, however, I could not figure out the characters' motivations for getting out of their situation as they did. It also seems very cliched to me. I think that maybe I was expecting something a bit more. The fic itself was very good as well. I will most definitely be reading this again, just because it's something new and different. It's great.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My daughter and I each loved this book, but for different reasons.   We both love to read nonfiction, especially about the human condition.  The writing is elegant and elegant.  It's clear that he has read about a lot of people.  And I don't know what I liked about the book better.  I did not like that he didn't talk about any other people as well as the characters, even though he does talk about the characters.  He doesn't seem to get it that people have different motivations and personalities, or that it's impossible to get that from the same author.  But I did like the characters more, because I am a person who is prone to jealousy (and it's a really good thing).    I really enjoyed this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... If you want a bad science fiction novel about a space invasion and a space adventure, this is it. It's a good book because it is very well-written, very enjoyable, well-paced and well-organized. It has a lot of good ideas and some good characters, but it really takes itself too seriously. It also has a weird habit of making everything else (particularly the space invasion) seem worse than it really is. The Space Marines get their own page after the book is over.   If you are a fan of space opera, fantasy, and military science fiction, you have to pick this one up! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my favorite books ever, but it was so bad that I gave up on it before finishing it.  I'm not really a fan of the "tragedy" theme but a part of me felt it was appropriate to the plot and I think some people would find that a nice change of pace.   I did not find anything really interesting about the main character, but I loved his little quirks and the fact that he was kind of a dick.  Another of my favourites, but only read the first 50 pages or so.  So I had this book, but the plot was all over the place, the world building was all a bit too detailed for my tastes, and it was just a big disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed.   The premise, which I found fascinating and I'm glad it's there, is that people have been altering reality for thousands of years using powerful tools called "the black lights" to perform magic tricks and trick people.  , but when it became too much to handle, one character had a very literal way of taking a "hard cut" at the real-world magic: his brain. That sounds a lot like what you do in the comic. A lot of people are going to want to find out, what's the difference, right? Well, it turns out to be a lot. This is, as we know, a hard science fiction story in that it involves a lot of magic and a lot more. Unfortunately, the narrative does not keep up with the research into the science at all, and that made it somewhat hard to follow. I found myself confused as to when and why the effects were happening. If I was to write a book like this, I would have had to do a lot better.   But this is a great book, as the author wrote and illustrated it very well. There's a lot going on here. The magic, the technology, the way people have tried to manipulate reality, the difference between the black light and the dark side of the force... the entire premise was fascinating and something that I'd definitely want to dive into. I loved the ending, which was even better than I expected. I'm looking forward to more books like this in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:       The story is interesting, but not amazing and is mostly just confusing.   One character is annoying, and the plot seems to drag a bit. I didn't want to finish it because the mystery seemed to be getting worse, but I wanted to know what happened next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:       "Lest we forget, the reason this book is important is that it is the first book about slavery written by a black author for a mainstream audience in America, who also happens to be the first black man to win a Pulitzer Prize." From the book description:  A study of the life and career of a celebrated 19th-century poet and writer, including a close reading of his poems about slavery. By Richard Wright, Ph.D.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a few pages of this book after my other one of the same author, and, although I have not read the other book, I thought I was missing something. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this one. The book is about a woman who, while at her home, is attacked by her dog. The dog attacks her mother, who kills it, and then goes to the police. The mother's boyfriend finds the dog in the street, and the dog is taken to the shelter to be sterilized. Then we go back in time, and find that the dog, "Pit" was abandoned on a farm in the 19th century. He is raised as a farm dog in a farmhouse, then later raised as the family dog and then as a family pet. At some point, the dog gets too powerful for the family, and it is shot. Pit is then brought back to life, and is raised by the family as a "friend" and then eventually becomes a pet again. At a certain point, Pit's father starts seeing another woman, and Pit and the woman end up having an affair. The father then comes in to find that Pit has killed his son, and has been arrested. Now, the wife who is trying to have a relationship with Pit is also in love with the man, and she wants to kill Pit to keep him from being involved with the woman. This makes Pit's relationship with the wife worse, as the wife wants Pit's position and pit's death. I couldn't really find the plot going anywhere, and was rather bored.  The second one I read was about a teenage girl who, as a child, lived in a town with her mother's husband. The child, whose name is Anne, gets a puppy for Christmas. When the puppy dies, the child's mother, "Molly," brings it home, but then dies, and in her grief, the mother kills herself. Anne then tries to get the puppy back from her mother and her boyfriend's father, but Anne gets stuck. Molly's mother's father finds Anne, and gets her to return the puppy to her, and to stay with Anne. The two then go on a long road trip to a small town, in which Anne tries to win over the owner of a farm where Anne's mother grew up, and learn how to be a good mother. On the road, Anne learns how to make friends with the farm's cowherd and
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been on the quest for a good fantasy series, and this is it, I am so glad that this one got better and is now a good series, however I think I should go back to the original. I found myself wanting to go back and start a new series, I found it hard to follow the plot because I wanted to know what would happen next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I've got a very sensitive heart, so when I read about a young woman having her body used and abused by the men in her life, I tend to go a little nuts.   Well, let me tell you something about my son:  I am in the middle of a divorce, and my husband is very controlling and emotionally abusive.  He is a horrible father, even though he doesn't realize it.  My son has two brothers, and both are quite abusive, too. I think my husband could have at least made a sincere effort to help my son and my brother get along, but it was obvious that he didn't like them and didn't want to change their opinions about him.  And the worst part is that he is not very smart.  It was hard for me to tell him that the people who treated me badly were just jealous and controlling because I felt bad about being the reason for his anger.  I was surprised when I discovered that I was right.  As I'm typing this, the new book is out called The Darkest Hour by James Dickey. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole book was just a big waste of time   There's an awful lot of information about the various drugs used to treat depression, but very little about the drug treatment and what causes it to work.   They do talk a bit about the side effects, but the information was not very well researched and was not really relevant to the book   One book for kids and one book for teens is just not enough  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "An excellent collection of a great book" - Chris Leopold Review  "An excellent selection of one of the most memorable and important books ever written about the Christian faith." - The National Review Review  "A fine book" -- The Gospel Herald  I am honored that you are interested in reading my book. I would like to thank those that I have consulted about the topic of my book and they all seem to agree that it is a fine book. - Chris Matthews, Pastor  What a delightful book! - John MacArthur  Thank you for a great and entertaining read. - John Green  There are three major reasons why I enjoy The Last Supper. First, it is one of those books which is so well written and so engaging that you find yourself laughing out loud at moments. Secondly, it tells the story of a story in a way that's fun, exciting, entertaining, engaging, and easy to understand. And thirdly, it reminds me of what I have found is one the most important things about the Bible: the God who is both the God of the Old Testament and the God we worship in the New. That is, the God in whom we find our deepest strength. For it is in Christ, the divine Redeemer, who died for our sins and rose for our justification. The Lord's Supper is our first glimpse at the reality of that life. - Thomas G. Tuck, Pastor and President, Liberty University  As you know, The Last Temptation of Christ has been a long time in the making. You know how we at Good News Club work to get out some very good information about the God God we know and love. And when the time is right, we find new truths and new light shed on older truths. This book fills the same category. - Richard W. Diversion, Pastor, St. Peter's Episcopal Church  Thanks for sharing your thoughts about this book! I'm grateful that it's been a worthwhile experience for me. - Matt Hagee, Founder, Hillsong  The Last Succodion of Christ is an important book. You have created a well-reasoned and interesting discussion about it. I hope it can help many other Christians. - Kevin M.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a waste of money. The plot is absolutely retarded. The bad guy's name is The Wizard, and he is all-powerful. So he just starts wrecking stuff in the story. It starts by setting a huge volcano on fire and sending a swarm of giant rats out to eat a nearby village. Then the wizard starts making things explode by just thinking about it. The whole book is based on the idea that the bad guy could just think about it too, and the fact that he does makes it so much more interesting. Then, just at the end of the book, he makes a giant meteor. You know, just to see what kind of impact it could have. Anyway, the story ends when the bad guys take over a small town, and are about to make a bunch of babies with a bunch (okay, a lot) of innocent children. The children manage to get away, and The Wizard has a huge heart-attack. (This book was originally published in the UK in 1985). I think I paid almost three hundred dollars for this book, and if you are going to have a plot like this in a book, you could do a lot worse than have a buncha punks blow things up, and then the good guys come in to save the day, because it's about time. It's worth noting, that this book is written by a woman, and so some of the things that she says that aren't supposed to make any sense (such as "the bad guy is all the way over there" and "no, we'll save everyone," etc.) might be true, but it's a lot of work for a fantasy book to have the character say something that is clearly supposed to be a fantasy statement.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the only book I will buy from now on. It doesn't come with a certificate of authenticity, but I'm willing to buy it again anyway.   I love how well the book details the history of the book but then fails to cover any of the history in a way that I'd actually want to read. I've already read about the Book of Mormon and I've seen the documentary, but this book isn't good for them, either. I found myself wondering if the book has been edited. It's not bad in the least; it's good in the fact that it covers the history, however it's just way too short. The "historical records" mentioned are actually just accounts from the 16th to 18th centuries, which is not very useful or interesting. I'll also be very interested to see the Book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book was the same as the last one, but the last book was about a woman who had been a slave for her whole life and went out and found a woman that had the same kind of life. So this book was like, "Well, now she has another slave, which is more like it."   I'm not a fan of reading about a slave being a woman slave, because it's the kind of thing that's always going to be a little boring because of the way it's told.   I'm sure the author thought he'd have a different approach, but I think the fact that he is also just talking about the same thing but with a different voice shows he doesn't really know what he's doing and I guess that's what the "good" is about:  "He said she was a man whore, a man who bought into his story, who would not say no to a man, who bought a man's stories. He said it was a bad story because it was based on nothing. It was based only on a woman, who was not really a slave."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually enjoy YA books (I'll read a Harry Potter book once in a blue moon), but in this book, I couldn't put it down. It was like my favorite movie, and I wish they made more books like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    ( ) I didn't think the book was bad or not good, but I have a very strong opinion about the "Happily Ever After" ending. It's really the last scene where I feel the story was over and I just wanted to see the next book.   I don't know what it is that I dislike, but my main beef is not that she didn't write a good book, but that I really feel that if it were me in her shoes I wouldn't finish this book. I felt that it was written as if I would be able to finish it, but instead, I had to go back and reread the previous book, because the ending just didn't feel real and it was just not very good for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a really good book. The author is a friend of mine, he does what I would call a "proper" writing job. I'd never read any of the others from this genre, and while it's not a bad one, it's a very good one. I enjoyed this book a lot and think it's worthy of a lot of attention and enjoyment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got my copy of the book from Amazon on Amazon and thought it was a really good book.   The reviews on the book are about half positive, half negative, and one is almost a 2 star.  Some reviewers seem to be in love with the premise of the story and are disappointed that the book doesn't provide much on how the world operates.  The author doesn't say anything on the characters themselves.  I guess I have to believe she just went with it, because what the world would be without humans?   Overall this book was really good.  However I was hoping it would have a little more detail on what the inhabitants of the world look like. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a lot of good books and never come close to anything as good as this.  I'm hooked on this story and want more! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a person who likes to read, I had high expectations for this book.   The book is great for students who are working on research projects.  It is also great for people who are trying to improve their writing skills.  But as I read, this book made me angry.  I really don't like when books try to push a political agenda, and I felt as if this book was very opinionated.  The most important part of the book was when the teacher was describing the "politics" of the time, but this part really made me sick.  There was an entire section where the teacher talked about how "radical" the time was and then said that people were against abortion rights.  This book is supposed to be about history, but instead it was a textbook for political correctness and feminism.  In short, this was a very poor book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I read a book called The House of Leaves...   It was a fun read. I'm not sure what people are talking about, but I didn't find any of the characters believable at all.   There were many things I didn 't like about the book at all, but i felt that was just the author trying to write a more interesting book than the one they had.  In the end, it didn't really feel like the author was trying to say anything.  I was just bored.  The author claims that the book was made with a storyboard, but it wasn't really that.  There was a lot of dialogue that i had to skip because the characters were in the middle of talking about a subject i already knew all about.  It didn' t seem to come from a real person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the book that started me on my path of self-discovery.   I was reading it as a teenager, and it is a very interesting account of a young man's life during the second world war, and his adventures in the USA during the fifties.  This is a fascinating book that could have easily been written a few decades later.  I did not agree with everything in this book but this is certainly a great book to read.  If you are into WW2 history you may want to skip this book, however, if you love books with a bit of romance, mystery, espionage and history then this book is a must read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not only a terrible piece of writing (or rather, a great piece of terrible writing), but also a bad read.   What makes this book so bad is that it is one of the worst fantasy novels ever written.  I understand why some people enjoyed it, but there is nothing here for the average reader.  The story starts off strong with a great premise and a solid plot: "The War of the Kings" by Richard Morgan is about a young man who has a destiny, a destiny he has come to know only after he's been given a mysterious and powerful magical artifact that is said to change the future of the world.  However, the story never progresses or grows beyond that.  At no point is it explained why he has to do what he's doing, how he became the king's pawn, or why he is such a threat.  This is a great idea, but the execution is horrible.  To begin, the protagonist never really learns what his magic is, the way it works, how it works. He doesn't even know why he's given it, and that just makes it worse. He never really discovers why his family and the rest of the kingdom hate him.  Also, the characters don't really develop.  A bunch of generic baddies are introduced, and then the author just says, "oh, so that's what a bunch of dumbassery are doing."  This leads to the worst example of a good twist in fantasy:  In the first chapter of the book, the main character reveals that he has a strange ability that will allow him to travel through time.  After this revelation, everything changes.  We learn about his family's motives, and about the war between his family, the king, and the king of the dead.  If that were the whole story, this would have been great.  Instead, what we get is...well, nothing.  For the first 60 pages, this book is pretty much nothing but plot and character development.  When we meet the characters, there is almost nothing new to say.  No one seems to have any kind of motivation.  Everyone just goes along with everything, as if it were a routine.  There is no actual danger.  Not one thing goes wrong.  One character kills another, and it's not even his fault.  These are the kinds of things that would make a reader want to read the rest, but
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got a copy of "The World is Not Enough" to review because I wanted to support this book's creator.   But I was disappointed.  The author of this book really has no idea about the issues and the fact that it is an anti-war and pro-peace book (which is exactly what it aims to be)   "I want to go out and fight for my country, but I know I am a pacifist."   When I started reading this book, I thought it would be one of those books, that would be the perfect book to support the author.  I thought I would love the story, the language, and the ending.  However, upon further reading, it became clear that this is not the book that I intended.  This book is about a woman who wants to do some good in the world.  She wants to go overseas and fight with the US Army.  In the opening chapters, she meets some soldiers, and she is inspired to do something.  A book called "A Way to Stop War" is about how to do this, and this book is really the best way to go. However, once she gets out to a base where she thinks the soldiers are going to join up and fight, she is turned off. She is just not going to do anything.  After a lot of research, she discovers that most of the military in the US supports war.  If you google the book, you can see that the author's real life experience is that she is actually opposed to this.  And she points out that this war is being waged in such a way to make the US appear to be strong.  Then, when she gets to the point in the book where she is supposedly doing something good, it turns out to be all about American ego.  "A way to stop war" is a book about a person trying to do the right thing for her country.  But, when her country won't give her that much respect, she decides to do things her own way.  What does this book teach you? That the best thing you can do in the real world is to do what you want.  That people do what they want. That people don't really care about what you think.  Don't go into a situation thinking that everyone is going to love you. If you are a pacifism, be yourself, and do the things that you want to do
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, it was well written, but there was little depth to the story. The characters felt really thin, like cardboard cut out. The plot was a bit bland, I suppose it was meant to be a spy thriller, but it felt rushed. The main character (the narrator) didn't seem well developed, or maybe they decided to use a very stereotypical spy. There were some parts that were really interesting but the main character felt like he was doing things just to make the plot move forward. The cover art was pretty good, the characters were pretty well drawn, but the story just felt bland.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      1. The main character is a woman, and the story revolves around her coming of age. Her father died and she has had an affair with a man who is a distant cousin. She is very unhappy and unhappy she leaves him. She moves to a new town where she finds a new lover. She soon begins to suspect that this person is a sociopath. At first she doesn't believe him, but after some hard drinking and some really bad decisions he seems to have become a sociopaths kind of guy. The book is about this guy, who turns out to be a bad person, and it makes you feel very sorry for him. Unfortunately, the ending is completely anticlimactic. I'm sorry, but he ends the book on a cliffhanger. I wish I could read it again and see what kind of sociopath he is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (   ) (  )   I was excited about this book as it is the third book by J. M. Coetzee. Unfortunately, I felt like a lot of the book was just about the story of how he lived his life and not about the other aspects of his life. I was also disappointed that it ended abruptly in his fifties. I feel like this book could have been a good one if it had continued on. I have enjoyed his books but I just wish he could have made it into the realm of a longer novel. Recommended for: those who are fans of Coetzees' previous novels.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought I liked the book, but was disappointed because the ending just seemed wrong.   The ending felt rushed and not good enough, and the only reason I didn't give up on it is that the author was an author who really inspired me to write a book in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was very young, I used to read a book in my parent's library called The Big Red Barn.   I remember sitting in the library with my sister (yes, I am the eldest of four) when I saw a copy of The Big Green Egg on the shelf next to The Big Blue Egg.  A few months later I asked my mother about the book, and she explained, with an old fashioned attitude, that the big eggs are blue and the little green eggs are red.  I was confused, and thought the book was just like The Big Black Egg. I guess it's true, because I'm not sure it really makes a difference.  The book is really good, but the big blue eggs are so tiny you wonder why they had to be colored blue. The book has a blue cover, and a blue ribbon, which looks kind of silly because you know it's just a sticker on a book cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not find this book interesting at all. I did want to read more about the plot but I was not able to.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not think this book was that bad. But the main character in this book gets a very negative review.   My husband, whom I'm so in love with, thinks he's a very bad guy. It's the first book I got that he was against.   Review by: J. Kornblith I had the opportunity to listen to the audiobook as I was at work and I found it to be very informative. I loved the book and would recommend this to anyone who is an avid fan of the game.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not a fan of this book at first but I got the point and I like it. I think that you should just read the book without any expectations and let your own experience guide you on what is and isn't good or bad in it. It's not that you can't enjoy it. But you need to take it with some sort of critical lens. It may seem to be a bit cheesy at times, but that's only because I'm a sucker for cheesy romance novels and all the romance that is "good" and "bad". I read the novel on my own and without any review, I must say it's well-written and the characters are well-developed, albeit a bit weak in the beginning.   I'm giving this a four for the reason I said earlier: it's "good." It's funny, a bit corny, and the romance is cute but not cheesy. I'm glad I gave it a try and it was worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the plotline and characters in this book, but the writing was really rough. Some people may enjoy the story and characters, but others will hate it.   The characters are really unlikable and a little annoying.  I would recommend this book to people who are looking for some kind of paranormal/horror type of read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . ...the best book I've read, by far.   If you are a fan of science fiction you'll love it.  ..   It's a good book for a different age.  It has something to appeal to all kinds of audiences.  (April 19, 2018) I enjoyed this book.  I was not expecting much, and was surprised at how much this book did not disappoint.  The action is fast-paced and actiony, but not without logic.  In the first story of the book, which is the most simple, it is clear that everything that the book is doing is not necessarily logical, but because the author is working within the limits of science it seems natural.    The second story is more like a mystery, so the science isn't as important, but it's still interesting to see how different things happen when logic and emotion collide.  I especially liked the story of a robot who falls in love, and how this leads to a lot of unexpected problems.  My only criticism would be that the story about the robot fell a bit flat.  Instead of the robot coming to terms with his love and being able to accept his relationship, the story was all about the emotion between the robots.  If I hadn't enjoyed the second story so much I would have given it a 1.  This book had a lot to give, and I will continue to read it in future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of books and was eager to try this. This book was an absolute disappointment. It did not live up to the hype I had been led to believe. I really wanted to like this book. I am really, really disappointed.   I don't really like books about dogs. This is a great dog book that's worth the read. It's a well written story with a twist at the end.  Rating: 5/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am just finished a book that made no sense and it had the word "bunk" in the title. The writing is very bad and I felt like I just sat there waiting for the ending to come along. This book is only fun when you read a few pages and realize what was really going on. I guess the authors will say that they were trying to say "nothing" with the word bunk but that just sounds like a lame excuse for bad writing. I was really disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book, but the ending really, really sucks. I read the first four books and loved them, and then the last two turned out to be...well, worse than the others.   First of all, this is the worst book about sex I've ever read.  A "hilarious" scene in the first book (in which a virgin has sex for the first time) is made up for with a scene of the heroine in her mid-20s (about ten years after the sex) and her friend (a high school senior) standing next to a man who looks like a sex-starved Gary Busey who just ran out of condoms.  It's really not funny, I think.  The rest of the book is basically just a continuation of the first half of the novel, but with two new characters: a virgin who's now twenty and a young girl who has been in love with a boy since she was 12 years old.  I mean, I like this girl as a friend, but she's a complete pain in the ass.  There's so much drama in this book that a reader might get distracted.  And if you're a Christian (and I don't think I am, but that's just because of how badly I felt it was written) then the sexual relationship between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene is basically described as a sexual act that led to the death of both people involved.  That's why I give it three stars instead of four. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You are probably going to be disappointed by this book if you are like me and are a huge fan of John Grisham's work, as well as many others. The main character is not likeable, but he does have a good story that can be relatable to a large audience, although he is rather lacking in character and a deeper story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a person who's used to having books that don't make a lot of sense, I had a hard time with the book's ending. Not only was it poorly done, but I felt a lot like a sucker for buying it because of how well the first 20 pages or so seemed to be setting up the mystery. This book took longer to read than I would have liked, and I found myself impatient with the main character, who was not much more than a cardboard cutout. I couldn't stand him as a character. He was a total blank slate in many respects, with the most common thing he said being a statement like "I am what my mother wanted me to be." (Which is supposed to be some kind of big revelation.)  My only other problem with the ending is that I felt there was a big "if only" at the end that was a bit rushed and rushed in a good way.  In other words, despite some very weak points, I still highly recommend this book and would definitely read a sequel. .
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book hoping it would be good. I had heard very positive things about it, so I expected something fun. Boy was I wrong. The book took a lot of me out of my fantasy world.   The story seemed to be built around my love of "dungeons and dragons," but instead the books plot focused on the fact that all the characters (even the male ones) are boring.  The author had very little understanding of gender roles, so she used the female characters to tell the story of a woman's journey.  I also felt that the women were underused and I had trouble imagining a male character saying something positive about a woman. The story seems to center on a young boy who goes off to find his parents' killer, while the female child stays behind to raise him.  There were two other female characters that had a bit of importance, but they did not get a lot done in the story.  This book is a fun read, but as a fantasy novel it is not for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I loved this book!   This book had a lot of potential, it just wasn't well written. It could have been so much better and had a few things I liked.   But the writing was so bad that there were a lot that I just wanted to hate this book for. I was so disapointed.  I'm not a fan of science fiction because I feel that some of them don't get the sci fi aspects right. I feel like the sci f  This was one of the worst science fiction books I've ever read. It was so poorly written that I couldn't imagine what could have possibly been made of it. It's so bad in so many ways that I found myself just wanting to throw it into the trash.   The main character is called Michael. He's a pretty good person. He works at a school that provides space for people in special needs to get training and education. They do the job really well and he's been there for a while. But he still feels like there's something missing. He knows that the school can't work with a "special needs" teacher because there are too many different abilities there to be taught. But it's the other way around, the school needs Michael to be there for it to work.   was the main character called Michael!   This is so bad it really doesn't matter. We get to know Michael and it really makes me feel bad that he's not there. The book was about a space mission to Mars. It takes place about 7-8 years after the end of this story. We have a group of children and Michael is the leader of them. The other kids were a bunch of goofballs who got in trouble a lot for no reason and that's really why they were there. But Michael is a perfect little hero who keeps them all in line. But there are always these moments where he seems to have an answer for everything. But then, when things get rough, he doesn't really understand what the big deal is. Like he doesn of his own volition and he just wants to go play. But that's a terrible thing to do. He goes from "go play" to "I hate these people!" and then all the sudden, he's a big jerk who just yells at kids. And he's really not that bad at all in this book. But when his dad gets sick, it's really hard for him to care for them
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been a little put off by this novel. For starters, it's the first book of a series - but at 5 volumes, the series seems to be going nowhere. The second book, which seems to take place in the aftermath of the first (which is already long over by the time the third book starts) was just too much to take. Also, I've got a bad feeling about this one. I feel like it's about something like a vampire hunter in a world where vampires are extinct. I'll still give it 2 stars, as the story was interesting, but the author hasn't written anything memorable. I can't wait to see the next book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending of this book is a bit odd in my mind. It's sort of like a fairy tale that somehow ended up not being a fairytale, but a bad fairy tale. I am thinking that this book needs more good fairy tales. I read this for a college course and it did not do well. Overall, the story is just ok.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased the book by R.W.Baumann, a retired professor of mathematics at Cornell University. While I thought it was an excellent book, it didn't meet my expectations. A lot of the "proofs" are based on very weak mathematics and they are very misleading. In addition, some of the ideas are outdated and do not explain anything. Also, some parts were rather "chalkboard". This is probably the reason why my grade was so low. If you are looking for a book that teaches a simple proof of Euler's number theorem, then you need to look for another book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very bad book. I hate to say it because I was very interested in the subject matter. The story is very basic and lacks any interest, as it's essentially a fantasy in which you are a good guy rescuing a good girl from evil. The author uses it for a story about how evil people become good. No problem there. But it's the writing that ruins the story. The writer doesn't know how to write the emotions that would be felt by a good character who was wronged. You get no feeling of regret or guilt for this woman's actions. She's just a dumb, arrogant, evil woman who thinks she's so much better than her evil sister.   I had to look up the definition of evil to understand this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really disliked the book, I got some very good things out of it, but I found the story uninteresting and slow. There is some plot, I know, but the whole thing is just a very boring story, and I did not find any character interesting at all. The main character is very stupid and her story has more holes then a duck pond. This is definitely a book for readers who have read one book, but have no interest in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a serious case of book envy. I know of no other book that is so well written and so captivating as this one is. This story follows the life of Mary Ann Peters, a young woman who is a skilled writer, but is unable to get published. As a young writer herself, she seeks her mentor, Mary Elizabeth Peters, who is well-known as one of the top female authors in America. Although the story was very well done, the story itself left me wanting more.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad part:  The cover is pretty good but, overall, this book didn't really surprise me.  The good:  While I am very disapointed about the quality of this book, it was a good story. The author does a good job of describing the book's setting, and the story does have some good twists. The bad:  This was probably the book I would have liked least the most, but then I don't always get what I want from a book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really did enjoy this book, but it wasn't a good read at all.   It was slow going, and I found myself wishing the books plot ended and the author would have just been done with the story.  And that's not saying much.  I felt there was no real payoff for the many twists and turns the author took us through.  It feels more like a story that was thrown together and planned, and not a story built from many hours of work and research.  The ending was rushed, and it just wasn't believable to me.  If the story wasn't this slow, I would have enjoyed it, but I didn't.  Overall, a bad read, but still a good one for people who enjoy mystery/crime novels.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a whole, this book isn't bad, just a little dull. I found a lot of the characters to be rather generic and, if you've read enough science fiction or fantasy to feel at home, a bit predictable. The world and the worldbuilding are interesting, but it's the story that's so hard to take with you.   What I Liked: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "In order to sell me on this, I must tell you that you will likely enjoy it, I mean, it's like having a drink with a very well-known friend. You're probably going to leave there with an even better understanding of the world that we live in, not least because you've had a go at explaining it."
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I think that this is one of the better books I have read about a time travel story.   This story really is fun and funny. I love when a science fiction story is fun.  , the only thing that I didn't enjoy about this book was the ending. It was a bit abrupt and I felt that the author should have explained how the people in the time travel went back to a point before the time travelers' adventures.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really want to hear about the bad things about this book, so I'll give my thoughts on it one at a time: The writing is very good - the dialogue flows smoothly and easily and I did not find myself really frustrated by the chapters. I think most people will enjoy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is not interesting at all; not that I'm averse to a good story. But the lack of a story makes it uninteresting.   This novel is about an ex-con who gets a job with a criminal gang; the gang takes him on for some shady work, but the criminal underworld is not the sort of thing I'm into.  The plot is not what I expected from a police detective novel; instead, it just appears out of nowhere.  I was hoping for a well-written, compelling story, but I wasn't particularly excited about the plot and characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really like the book and it's a real challenge for a young adult novel to be written in the style and vocabulary of a 12-year-old and not end up sounding like a 7-year old's first book. The fact that they could write a story so well with so much emotion makes the book more enjoyable than most books of its length. That being said, there are a few parts where I felt like this book was trying too hard to make it seem like I was really in a bad place. The ending is extremely sudden and without any real buildup and it was done in such a sloppy way that I had trouble getting over the feeling that I wasn't getting closure. The characters are cute, but nothing feels real. The "villain" is a total dick and the story is pretty bad overall. I have a hard time believing that I actually loved this book despite its flaws and I'm not going to be surprised if the author never gets another book published again because, honestly, I don't have any interest in reading a book in this style ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to get a good laugh and I got just the opposite, I felt the story was pretty bad and it made me feel sick to my stomach the whole time I read it, the author should go on a diet and start eating healthier and see if it helps.   Also, I was really hoping this would end and I'd feel better, instead I just feel angry, I'm sure the main character was just really depressed in his whole life and he's only dealing with depression on a grand scale, the book ended a little anticlimactically and I was left feeling just a little uneasy after I finished it.  I'd recommend this book to a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as an intro for my new job as an Assistant Professor of Germanic Languages, and I did not find it to be a good introduction to Germanic language and grammar. The main issue is the way the grammar of the verb is written, and how it has to be written in certain ways in order to be grammatical. As the title suggests, the author makes the statement that "the Germans do not speak their native language correctly" in a variety of sentences. It appears that the author has read too much German to be able to use this as a reliable guide to the language. The grammar is not explained very well (the German part of the book is written by the same person that wrote the English part of this book). However, the main reason I did NOT like this book was because of the grammar itself. It seems that the grammar used is too complicated for the average person to learn (I have a BSc in German and am proficient in German grammar). I also found that the language being explained is not the same as what is used in real life - it is as if the author is trying to make the German language sound and act more complicated (a lot of times that is exactly what he is doing). I found the book to be confusing, to the point of being painful to understand, and to me to be inaccurate (the only reason I give it a 3 is because I did enjoy the book in the same way that I like good food and a good story). It seems like there are a lot of things about the language that need to be explained to the reader in order for the German grammar to make sense, but unfortunately the author chose the wrong language to explain the grammar.  Helpful? Yes  Why didn't you give it 3 stars? I really enjoyed the story, it did get a little boring a bit later though. The only thing that really bugs me is the grammatical mistakes. This was my first foray into the Germanic languages, and the grammar I was using when I started had many inconsistencies. I ended up spending about an hour a day on this book, to learn the basic grammar of German, and it was a really tedious process. I didn't realize how much time and effort went into it. So, yes, I think the grammar is a bit confusing, but it does explain all the rules and rules of the German verb system, and makes sure to explain all of the exceptions (in German). So for
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really had high hopes for this one. I didn't want it to be a disaster, just a book I found a bit predictable.   But after reading it, I felt more sorry for the book than I would have liked.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so glad I got my books in the mail... but the book I got... I hate it so much I just throw it in the trash because it's so poorly done.   "I am so tired of the thought of me feeling like I'm not doing enough for myself. I am so annoyed by the thought that I'll fail at a goal I set because I feel I'm letting down others."... "That day, as usual, I was alone, waiting for the bus. I'm going to a doctor's appointment tomorrow... that's the only thing that makes sense now... maybe it is time to stop living so that I can feel like I can do things right. If nothing else, I'd like to believe that I still have something to live for." I hope your friend doesn't take this as a compliment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a book that I have enjoyed, and I don't really like science fiction novels. However, I loved this book. It was a really fun read. I am sure that if I was to read another one of her books, I would like it even more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was good enough for me, I guess, but I can't say the same for others.   The author was kind enough to answer my question and was quite happy to discuss my experience.  What I want now is more interesting stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read two good books and the other is a great read, however, when I read about the character, there is no reason why he could not be played by the same actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst books I have ever read. There is absolutely NO REASON FOR ANYONE TO READ THIS BOOK! You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about and your point is so weak.   I have read a lot of books about women but this is my absolute worst one by a long way. I hope you get your pound of flesh and your bank account will survive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not the book I was expecting to hear about the ancient Greeks and their obsession with the golden era. It had many interesting insights about the Greek world and I am not an expert, but I am impressed at how well the book presents its subject. This book is definitely worth reading, even if you are an expert.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read many of her books, but I was always surprised at how little she actually said about her characters. She just made a list of how each one would act and acted.    " I like the style of her stories, and her characters... but her descriptions of her characters tend to be boring."  I've read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, and I'm not usually one for "bland" or "cliche". I was expecting more from the author of "The Mirror Empire" because of the fact that she's a "classic" of the genre. Unfortunately, the stories in the novel did little to convince me. There was no surprise as to why this particular character would be a jerk. This isn't the sort of writing that grabs my attention and keeps me reading. The fact that this book is on my shelves makes it very obvious that I'm going to be returning to this novel. I suppose I should also mention that there were many things that I found annoying about this novel, such as: - The fact she wrote out a story in her "story notes", but never actually wrote down the story in it's entirety - The description of the author as a "stupid, old woman" - The lack of details about the characters - The "discovery" of some of the characters being dead (which actually isn't that surprising).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad cookbook. My mom and my sister used to read this book together and each time they had to throw it out because the recipes were too complicated. This book is filled with all sorts of food recipes that are really not suitable to eat the way they are described. It's a waste of money. I've never been to China, and my mom still tries to cook this in China. It took a couple of tries to actually make it taste good but overall the food is terrible. I'm sure that the author got these recipe from a Chinese cookbook but honestly the recipes are so confusing that I'm afraid to make them again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is boring, and its content makes no sense and never comes up again for the rest of the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first few chapters to an eager 5 year old and her eyes bugged out at the mention of sex, I gave her the book with my best wishes and she immediately asked for more. I had been a bit worried about the amount of sex in it, I know that this is the age of the internet and I know there will be a lot of adults in this book but I feel that it is still too much sex for a 5 year-old.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved it, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the other books in the series.   There are two things that bother me.  I think they are related: 1) The setting in which the story takes place is really cool; but when the story begins, you don't have to be there.  2) The narrator:  I was hoping he was going to be a very good narrator, but he was awful.  There was no emotion, no expression, no anything that made his character feel like you cared about his thoughts or actions.  If you liked the first two books in this series, you should like the third one even less.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this in the mail, and I'm not going to say anything negative about it, because I'm a fan. I have loved all the books by this author, and this is by far his best, but, it's not the best book I've ever read in my entire life. The characters are so stupid and so unrealistic I felt sorry for them. The author's style was really hard to follow at times, and my patience was running thin by chapter six. I guess that's not surprising for a book about fantasy characters and wizards, but this was just a bad choice by the author to be completely unrealistic, and it's just that much worse because we have the ability to fix what's wrong in the books, so what the author did to make this better doesn't seem like such a good idea. For a fantasy novel, it really falls short of what it started as: it just lacks that one thing that makes a good fantasy novel: that is, good characters and believable magic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was ok, but not the greatest. The characters had little depth or a lot of fluff, and the story wasn't interesting enough to warrant re-reading. I enjoyed it enough to read the sequel, and I will probably read that after my second or third read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The good:  This book is a great read.  It was a great surprise!  It's hard to find an author, like me, who can so clearly capture the mood and the feeling of being in a foreign country.   I loved the ending and the ending is a perfect ending in the sense that it leaves the reader with so many questions and ideas that they cannot wait to see what's going to happen next! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't say for certain the book is bad, but it is a lot more confusing and incoherent than it's title might lead you to believe. This book is about a man who goes missing and the police investigation. What makes this worse is the fact that there is a HUGE amount of loose ends and the narrative takes a turn to the point that it is impossible to make any sort of conclusion at all. At one point he is arrested for a crime he did not commit. At another time he is murdered. This all takes place over the course of a week, but I could have gone on for an hour. I'd also like to mention that some of the dialogue is awful. Also, some of his descriptions of the setting are very vague and the author seems to have written himself into the story. If I could give it a negative rating, it would be because the book does start to lose its grip on you at one point, but in the end I couldn't find anything bad in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As if I needed a reason to hate this book. "What do you think you're doing?" asked the man. "Well, I'm hoping you can help me." "What's wrong with you?" the man asked. "That is not going to happen, not with the way you are dressed. If you keep that up, it might not be so bad." "But don't you have a job?" "Oh, of course," I said. "I have one, I just don't have time to go around trying to look as good as you do." "All right, get out," said the man, pulling a chair from his desk and putting it near me. I sat down and studied the man closely, trying to decide which one of us he wanted to get rid of. If he really was so interested in me, why would he be bothering to wear his clothes this badly? Why didn't he just leave me alone? "Do I look good?" I said, trying hard to be pleasant. "No. That is why I'm going to help you. I have a suit that is perfectly suited for you. Just look around, try on the clothes and you will see that they are perfect for you." I tried on a few things, all of which were too big, and all of them too small. "Now, you look even worse than you did before," the man said. And then he picked up a big suit, put on a nice new tie, and pulled off a little hat. He looked so good! I could see him walking around and making people feel comfortable, but that just wasn't my style, I thought. I wanted a good old-fashioned man, dressed up to go out on a date, and I wasn't getting it. I started to feel depressed about my life, but at that moment, the man pulled me out of my misery. "Listen," he said, "if this doesn't work out, maybe you can have someone else. Or maybe you just might decide that you want to get your own way." "Well," I replied, looking down at the floor. "You said I was not really going to get a good job." "Oh," said this man with the nice suit, "I'm sorry. But the man you have to meet is a very important man. You'll have to go through him to get to him." He motioned toward the door. "He knows a
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1/5 The book doesn't have any interesting ideas, it's just some random, very poorly executed characters.   (This is only an issue in the third book, but that's really the only reason.)   3/5 I really enjoyed the story (although some things were a little awkward)   4/5 It's one of the more interesting stories of our times, and I'm not sure if I'd read it again.  P. S.  When I read it first time, I was hooked, because I'd never read anything this good.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited when I read this book. I have always been a big fan of John Grisham's work. I'm not the biggest fan of his writing style. This is the first book of a trilogy, so I wanted a more traditional read. But this was just a really slow and drab book. In fact, I couldn't stop thinking about the title at the end - just a little too much of a coincidence. If you are a fan of Grishams style you will definitely enjoy this book, but if you are looking for a more mainstream/literary book - then don't pick it up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first book I read in English was a memoir of the author's father, a man of great power in his native Italy. I was disappointed by the author and thought the book was a waste of time. It just wasn't a book for me. The second book I tried to read was a biography of Joseph Stalin. This book, while very interesting, did not hold my interest. I thought it was a boring book. I read all the reviews on this book and some of the reviewers didn't like the book because it was boring, but I think it's a good book, and I think that the author might have been under some pressure, so there were some things that the reviewer didn't get, but this is not something I'd recommend.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author could not write the story well enough to get past the first 100 pages. The ending is weak because it is not satisfying to the reader.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was written by a very, very, young, dumb, arrogant, entitled, spoiled, entitled woman. If you love kids, don't read this book. I read it while I was in a deep depression and I was so tired of everyone saying, "I love books for kids" and "I loved it" while I kept telling them, "Why are you asking that?"   This is the kind of book that will break your heart  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "This book is absolutely ridiculous. I really think I might like it more if it had more action and violence, but that may have been by choice. This book will not make you think in a philosophical way; it will make you laugh and feel like a dumb jock. If you like humor, and want to read a book that will make your jaw drop and laugh at every stupid plot, then this book is for you." - 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a bit shallow in some parts. It is filled with information that is not needed or even beneficial to the story. I did not find that much in the book that would change my opinion of a book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was awful and it left me with the impression that it's a book for people who think that it is just as important for people to be taught to read (and therefore that they should spend their time on trying to do so) as it is to be able to read well. This book made no sense at all and really left me feeling bad for the author (who must be an idiot). This is definitely NOT a book I would recommend.   This book was terrible. My husband got so frustrated because the book is about a woman who has the same issues as my husband, but the author of this book is so clueless that she thinks that all women are like my husband and the book makes her a hero instead of pointing out that the author is an idiot.  I found this book to be incredibly bad.  There was one thing in the book that was kind of good--the book is written in a very passive voice, but it still made me feel uncomfortable and didn't feel good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bit overrated. The main character has a hard time connecting with other people and getting close to a few of them, but at the same time he's willing to put up with their stupid jokes and childish shenanigans, and that works for me. The problem is the premise. The book is basically about the girl who comes to the library, and finds out her boyfriend is a vampire (because his name is Kevin and she is a werewolf), and decides she wants to become a were-woman for love. She goes through a lot of issues from that point on, and is generally a complete moron by the end. Not to say I didn't like this book, I do! But in this particular case, there are better books out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "   "There is an awful lot to hate in this book." -  Kameron Hurley, SF Signal Book Club Review  "  "   I am giving it three stars in the hopes that the author will at least acknowledge the glaring inaccuracies of the book, which are so numerous I cannot do justice to them here." - Kameron Horwitt, SF Magazine   Pace is not the most remarkable book in this collection of short stories. But it is by far the best. There is no "good" and "bad" in it; there is no protagonist and no antagonist. There are no morals, and no good versus evil. The world is brutal, and its inhabitants are not especially nice either. It is a very sad and cynical world, full of hatred, violence, deceit and deception. But the world also contains a kernel of hope. There exists a secret, unspoken history between the cultures of the land and a secret and unknown culture in the stars beyond. There's a kind of peace and understanding between the two sides that the inhabitants of the human world are simply unaware of. And all is not lost, because even within this hopelessly corrupted world there are still those who want to change the world and do their best to make it a better place. "     As in the short stories, the style is highly polished, a little too much for my taste, but then I can't help liking the way the author uses language. In the same vein as  William Gibson,  John Varley and  David Brin  here is a story told from the perspective of a character who thinks and acts in a way that would seem to be completely absurd if told from an objective perspective. This is a style I find much more interesting, and a style that makes for a more interesting story. In this case the author is also more descriptive and uses more direct language (I can't even begin to count the instances of profanity). As a result of these changes, the stories are more detailed and less simplistic and are less likely to make you feel that you're in a world that is filled with horrible characters and horrible situations. The author also does a good job of setting up tension between the main characters. The situation is always escalating, which helps to keep the reader interested and engaged. I was a little frustrated that there was a big gap between the events of the story and the first part of
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "   The good news is that this book is a good, quick read, and you won't have to spend a lot of time thinking about the book. The bad news is the ending and that everything is a complete non-sequitur. "  " The Good News : I really enjoyed the book, even though I thought that the ending was a little strange. I would read the sequel, if it existed. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . The characters in this book are terrible. They're all idiots in the first 50 pages or so, then, after the introduction, they turn into the worst of the worst. In fact, it's kind of hard to make a point with all the characters. They all have something bad about them. Some, like Tom, are terrible people. Tom, the narrator, is a horrible writer. In the first 100 pages, he's writing one story after another about his wife's ex-husband, a "savage beast" who is "always in the way" (he calls him "suscious" and "bitchy" and tells him that his marriage is "tied up with a rope and a bucket of water"). Tom has written at least 40 pieces of work. Of these 40 pieces, he is the only one to have written something that is not bad and not boring. He's also the only writer to have told me, "I'm working on a story about an evil husband who rapes his wife and then leaves her." He's the only other writer to whom I have ever said "I can't believe you have that much writing experience and have published so few pieces." There are so many characters in the book. I want to hate all of them. I keep wanting to give up and say, "Oh well, at least it's only the bad guys." But I can't. I hate all the stupid, whiny, boring people. This book is terrible in every way, from bad writing and bad characters to bad premise. If you are a lover of the classics, then you will enjoy this book. If it's all crap and you can't stand the dialogue, then please don't waste your money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is boring. I was never interested in the characters and I never felt anything for the story except boredom. It is so short it would have been better if there were two more books. I feel this would have benefited from more character development.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first trip to the beach.   And here's the thing:  One of the book's best chapters is about how to read and write a blog post about reading. It's also about writing a negative blog post, but instead of being a critique of an author or book, it's about reading and writing a blog review of a book. I find the whole thing to be about the same thing.  It's a really good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book, but it was pretty predictable and predictable in a bad way. I can forgive the author a lot on that part but other than that it just isn't very good. I don't think the characters are very well developed. The first half of the book takes place at the beginning of the series so you get a lot of information about the main characters, including the characters that are not so important or interesting, and their actions aren't really important in the overall scheme of things. They're there but they're not that important. The second half is the main story and that takes place after the beginning and so I just didn't have a lot to relate to, besides the character who's being bullied by the two girls who get teased and taunted by the character at the book's beginning. This book got a 4 star rating from me because I think there are some things that could have been done differently or something could have happened differently but that would be cheating. I guess the main issue is that the author doesn't think he's writing a fantasy book but he's really writing a story about a boy being bullied. He's written a lot about the book being a bad boy novel but I just don't feel like the characters had any development and their reactions are pretty predictable in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book because of the amazing premise and it's premise is absolutely not believable, I know the author has been working in a very limited genre but that's the only thing this story has going for it. First off the book starts with a series of murders. When I started I thought the author would give us a small insight into the crime but I soon realized the author is taking the first book and making all of the characters as the killers, and not giving us enough information to help us decide who killed these people. I just couldn't help but feel that the entire premise is a waste of time and not to mention a very cheap one. If the only premise for a murder mystery was "mystery, mystery, mystery" I'd be all for it but unfortunately for these people the premise is "mysteries, mysteries, mysteries". As for the characters, the narrator has all the right motives to make me believe what he says but the plot makes me wonder how the author even managed to get the people we think are the murderers to make it this far.The book was interesting enough to read but I won't be reading anything else by this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on my Kindle on July 11, 2012 as my first Kobo eBook for Kobo. I had always wanted a hard cover book so this one seemed like a good choice. I didn't like it at all, so I cancelled my order, and I'll never be ordering Kobo eBooks again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book would have been so much better if I'd known it was a collection of various pieces by different authors.   I don't see why people should pay this much money for a collection that has more flaws than an elevator!   The characters are all so bad that you'd have to give up the plot.  The "story" is one giant misstep after another.  It's really hard to tell what's a misstep and what isn't.  A lot of the characters are so annoying and uninteresting that I wonder if they'd be better off if they had been left out of the story.  I love the concept of the series, but the books are so poorly written that it makes me wish I'd started a different series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book, but as much as I like books by women, this one is a disappointment. I love when female authors write about women and the problems they face in life, but in this book I could see why they had to go through a series of male protagonists in order to write this book. In the first few chapters, the narrator describes her love life, and then we are introduced to a series male characters that help her get over a difficult ex-boyfriend (she's also pretty sure she might have met the same person). In order to explain her experiences to a male character, she is forced to tell a very specific story about how she met the man. I can't say I enjoyed the book that much, but the book at least made me think about the fact that female-female relationships are often complex. I guess I would have been better off buying a book with a female author as my narrator.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   When I read this book for the first time I thought this story is amazing. The main character is so likable and a well developed. But after a few minutes I just had a bad feeling in my head. I thought about the story about the little boy who was born without a brain. The story is just unbelievable and I was expecting more. It was so hard to understand the world around them. It is so hard for me to believe that this was written in 1980s. There was so much wrong with the world and I couldn't understand why anyone was happy. The author wrote in a way to make this story even more interesting than it is. The way she changed the characters around was so weird. It didn't feel like it was true to the original story, it felt like it just happened to be based in this time period. It wasn't bad but it just didn't fit. I will be waiting for the next book because I really want to know more about this story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A lot of people think that The Secret, when read, will provide them with the answers to the riddles of the universe and solve all their problems. They will spend the rest of their lives searching for the truth. It is only when a person is looking for the perfect person in the perfect situation that they come upon The Secret.   I'm not sure if it's this book's intention to make you feel like you can take anything, but the lack of believability can lead to some strange consequences. A lot is told as though the reader will be able to understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of the Munchkin series. The first book is one of the better ones, with a solid plot and a cool idea that's executed well. The second book is pretty bad too. The Munchkins are an overused trope, but this one isn't funny enough to justify their existence. And, in a really lame move, the third book is an afterword by Jim Hines that has absolutely nothing to do with the book. The series is also plagued by the fact that every single book is written by a Munchkina. It's a real shame that this series got so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... I was surprised to see that " The Big Picture " is an interesting book at least. I have not been terribly impressed by most of the non-fiction books I have read on the topic. They tend to be very dry or academic and not very inspiring.   I think this book is worth your time, though, particularly if you are interested in the topic (it is a huge one).   This book is probably the best attempt to make the topic as engaging as possible.  This is a fascinating look at the world we live in today. The book is more informative than a lot of the more academic works I have found. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think I would have ever bought this book, but then I was trying to be a good person and read a book that was written in a very condescending and nasty fashion by a woman with little to no education.    What I found appalling is that it was presented as something positive, when it was actually a book about how she was being wrongfully accused, and how she couldn't understand why the judge was so harsh in handing down the sentence.  This is why I haven't given a book rating so far, and I am still on the fence about this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this one, but it fell short of my expectations. The main problem was the pacing of the book, which felt pretty rushed (at least it felt rushed for me as I tried to finish it). I was really excited to read this book, but I ended up finishing the last chapter just to be sure I wasn't reading a retcon, I'm just too busy with real life. Maybe I'm reading the wrong book?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had read a lot of Stephen King before I was asked to write one of his. I have written several horror books for a few publishers and liked them, but not this one. The first hundred pages or so are fine. It's not a great book and it does have its problems, but it's not bad. Then it drops in a pile of shit, with the only good part being an early character, and the bad part being a lot less interesting than it could have been. I was disappointed and won't be reading another King. - David J. Ewalt, September 25, 2005...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a poor kid named Mike who is an idiot. It does not make me laugh.   I was disappointed with this book.  The story is very bad. I can't understand how a guy could do this to his father. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I felt like I was reading a complete waste of time. The first two books I read were great and it would be great if this was followed by a great final book." (June 2013 review from the Library of America) " I had a wonderful experience with the first two novels in the series and am so very glad I read them. This book, however, was just a complete misstep." (April 2012 review from Publishers Weekly) "I have been a lover of the series since my late teens. The characters have always been interesting and believable, the writing has been perfect and this last book has not only been a disappointment but a downright disappointment. This novel was far from a pleasant reading experience." (December 2011 review from a fan)  I had a fantastic experience reading The Emperor's Blades series. I was a little disappointed with this one...the last book seemed a little lacking. I think the reason I feel this way is because the final book is one that was not well written. It is a little slow paced and I did not like what I felt was a change in the book's theme. This was a good read though and is worth trying out!
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I'm really interested in reading the second book in this series. It seems like we are getting some action here and it's definitely moving up in the genre (as I feel like the other books have moved up a step).   This series is a definite must read in my opinion and I would like to see where things go from here!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing to say about this book but I wish it was better. The stories were interesting, the writing was good and the stories themselves were interesting but it is hard to enjoy reading something like this when the writer can't put a plot twist together on the fly or has no imagination. There is also a lot of talking about being gay and that is really out of place since this is a lesbian book, it's about two characters being in love with another character. I have read other stories about lesbians and bisexuals like this and they are just as interesting. I wish I could give this book 5 stars because it does have a few great moments.
