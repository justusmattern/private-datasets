Write a positive review about a good book:    "A compelling account of the rise and fall of the Soviet state and its subsequent transformation into an independent, multi-party, market-oriented economy, The Road to Power chronicles the extraordinary life of President Boris Yeltsin from the age of 16 to his assassination by the KGB in August 1991." --Robert A. Heim, The New York Times
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book, especially when it came out before I'd finished my book about the "other" Jesus, which I'd also read and liked very much. In my case, my initial reaction was one of puzzlement, since it seemed so obvious that the "Jesus of the gospels" was a mythical person whose ideas could be found in other ancient religions and which could be read in many other places. I suppose I was hoping for a less obvious answer, one that wouldn't require a great deal of searching to see, but that still would be a good conclusion to a difficult but worthwhile story. I'm glad to have found one, even though it does suggest that the mystery of Jesus of Nazareth's identity has more to do with how he's been understood than with anything actually found about him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was reading a book about some old friends I'd made in the 70's. One of them was a Jewish guy who was from New York who had moved back to the city to live with his sister. The book made me reminisce about the times when we'd go out on the town and have so much fun together that it was hard to see her go. The memories of being with him were very touching. We all knew how to party back then. I hope this book gives me the chance to do just that again.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "We've always been attracted to books with strong women characters: smart, independent, tough, tough as nails... This is the only book I have found in which all of the women are smart, tough and independent." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Good Earth by Algernon Blackwood is a masterpiece of environmental storytelling. It is a story about a human society that, through environmental and technological advances, achieves a kind of harmony with its environment that the human population has been unable to achieve.   This may sound like some kind of hippie commune. In actuality, it's a story of humanity overcoming the    in order to create a better world. This is the most compelling book on the environment I've ever read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had been hearing good things about the  " The Wisdom of Psychopaths " for some time.  I knew, however, that the title meant I was going to be disappointed.  "Psychopaths" isn't a very well-defined term.  Is the term referring to a type of person?  Is it referring to people who are cold and calculating, people who will manipulate, sell and hurt people to make their own endsÂ  known?  Or is it referring more to people with poor moral character, who lack empathy, a conscience and a conscience of conscience?  What the book describes as psychopaths, the term actually encompasses.  They're not all the same thing.  So it was really interesting to come across some really different personalities, some who are considered highly intelligent and some who clearly don't.  In a way, the book is about these differences and the differences between people who can be called psychopaths. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book in a new trilogy about the early life of a hero. As a child, I was enthralled by the novel  in which the hero learns to walk. It's a great story and, as always, the characters are well-drawn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very skeptical about this book. It had a lot of things that sounded plausible at first (the moon landing, etc.) but turned out not to be. The author does a good job of outlining a theory that could be true, but that turns out to be false. But it is still entertaining. I liked the idea that we all owe an explanation for our existence to our ancestors. But I wasn't sure about the details.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely loved this book. It's very well written, has a lot of heart, and it offers solutions to some problems that are very practical.  I hope to read many more books by her, and I highly recommend her other books, particularly "The Mindfulness Revolution." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a lovely read, but for whatever reason I found it so difficult to get into.  It's a pretty well-written story about a gay man who comes out to his family.  The premise of the book is that it's his family who are the most accepting of his homosexuality and have been since he was young.  They don't seem to think he should have to live in the closet because he's already been living a gay life for decades, and they think he can be happy with his life as it is.  I enjoyed this so much that I bought a copy and started to read it and thought it might be better than I expected.  This book is great for someone who wants to read a good gay book but has reservations about it because it's too straight.  (I think it's worth the effort just for the love story.) 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was 19, during a phase of my life that I like to think of as the "troubled teen" phase.  I remember it well because, despite being a huge fan of teen fiction and writing, I was utterly repulsed by the teenage characters in my favorite books (for whatever reason, I'm not sure) and this book was perfect for me.   The teen characters in the book were so likable, I wanted to hang out with them all the time.  And I especially liked the "bad girl" character who did things that would get her in a lot of trouble.  She was just so real and likable and fun to read about! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was one of the best I've read.  It is a very thorough account of the development of the American system of government, and particularly of the presidency.  The book makes a great deal of case that many of the flaws in our federal system, as well as in the political culture in which the American president has to function, can be traced to the creation of the White House itself.  Although much of the history of the early republic is written from the point of view of the establishment of the Constitution, it is clear that the White house, and with it the presidency, is the product of a distinctly American political philosophy.  This is not to say that the Founders were without faults, but that they made decisions about how the republic was to function on the basis of the principles they understood, rather than those that had been handed down from father to son.  We see this reflected in our Declaration of Independence, in our Constitution and in our form of government. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always loved the way this book deals with the religious question.  It's a good introduction to the subject, and offers a good discussion of issues such as whether or not we can know the divinity of Jesus or not, how faith is not an illusion or a "fairytale," and how the gospel differs from the pagan religions of antiquity.  I found that it dealt with many of the issues I'd been struggling with recently, and was helpful to see a more balanced view of the subject.  Overall, it was a good read, and I can't wait to get my hands on the next edition.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like the book, and I like its subject matter, but I wish it had been written with the same style as the movies.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't know much about Japanese culture, but after reading this book I feel like I've been back home in Japan for awhile. It's about an American woman who moves back to Japan after living in the US for 15 years, and is forced to learn about her Japanese culture.   It's a pretty slow read, and sometimes it reads as an overly-witty and self-aggrandizing memoir, but it's so well-written that it's worth the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   " The End of the Road: A Short History of America's Most Important Transport " is a short, well-researched history of American transportation. The author's writing style is excellent, and his general thesis is well supported by historical data. "I like the way he describes the railroad: in the nineteenth century, the railroad was a rare form of mass transit, a way to get from point A to point B. In the last half of the twentieth century, it fell out of favor because the nation was going to a smaller, more dispersed place. The country's population grew at about the same pace as the railroad's, but the railroads themselves were in decline. In 1960, the last year for which complete records are available, the average U.S. commuter rail passenger-miles fell to just under ten thousand. In 1966, the rail system served only forty thousand trips per day. The book's title comes from a famous passage from an obituary for the Brooklyn, New York, subway, in which the writer says that the line is "one of the most useless forms of public transportation in America," in part because it doesn't serve the local people, and in part for being an embarrassment to New York. This is a good summary of my own feelings about Amtrak's "last gasp" of usefulness." --David R. Jones, author of "The New Urbanist: The Race to Create the Next Great City" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a good, straightforward, simple book about a great book. I don't know why it doesn't get better reviews, since the basic premise is so good: A man discovers a box of "magical" coins that change anything he throws into them into something "special" (which is the whole point). He has several friends who have never found the box, and he goes to their house to show it to them. They don't believe him, and don't ask any questions about the coin, but he can't take it back. Finally, he comes back home to find it buried under his father's bed. He opens it up, and finds a letter from a little girl. He is amazed that the little girl had gotten so far in the game, but then he sees a picture of her and is overcome.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very interesting and worthwhile look at the role of the media in shaping public opinion. This book is particularly timely as a result of the ongoing media-fueled debates about the death penalty. While the book takes an unbiased look at both sides, the book includes both positive and negative information that I agree with.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great! It's the kind of book that is so well written it just has to be read! The subject is interesting, the story is good, and the writing is elegant and elegant. I recommend this book to all my friends who are interested in the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo in 2009. I was immediately hooked. The author's simple tips, techniques, and ideas changed the way I live. I recently gave the book to my children and they were all thrilled by it.  It's so easy to follow.  I've made a number of changes to my home already, and my house looks great!  Thank you, Marie! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have only read one book, and that was this one. I must say I liked it very much, and the story told was very good. It was a bit difficult to read at times because it was written in a very detailed style, but that is part of the point.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well written book. It's got a clear, easy to follow story, and a wonderful, heart-warming ending that I had tears in my eyes at!   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. It was a bit long but I found the information interesting and helpful.    It was mostly a history lesson in the way our institutions of government are broken. But he also wrote about current events.  A couple of times he described the economic collapse and how our country reacted, and it was so well done I really laughed. I really found it funny how he would say something like, "People are always saying that they want things to stay the same, but never change. They're very different people when the things they want change, and they're very happy about those changes, and vice versa." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as part of a required undergraduate course in early modern history.  As with many other books in this series, it uses historical methods in order to illuminate political, social, and cultural aspects of the era.  The author's interpretation of the causes and consequences of the French Revolution was the most convincing to me.  While I did find a few other factors, I found the author's explanation of the origins and consequences to be especially helpful.  He describes the French state as the product of an alliance between the bourgeoisie, the monarchy, and the clergy, all of which had a vested interest in the status quo, and who had, as a result, been unable to offer effective opposition to the revolutionaries.  When the revolution failed, the leaders of the various factions sought to establish a counterrevolutionary order, but this did not happen.  By contrast, the "bourgeois" elite that had been so influential in the French Republic had been largely discredited in the revolutionary movement.  Consequently, this elite saw itself as the only power strong enough to prevent the restoration of the monarchy.  They made their first real effort in 1801 to bring down the monarchy in order gain a degree of control over France.  Although many of the conspiracies that took place were the actions of individuals, the author provides enough details to demonstrate the involvement of the central authority.  Finally, the French bourgeoisie, which had been relatively successful in the war against Napoleon, became alienated from the Revolution when it failed to win the day.  Despite its power to bring about the Revolution, the bourgeoisie found its authority greatly weakened by the monarchy's support for the anti-revolutionary faction, and as a consequence was eventually overthrown and replaced by the aristocracy.  All of the forces that were responsible for France's early development were now in disarray, and it is little wonder that things got out of control.  Overall, this is a very interesting and well researched study that is worth reading for those interested in the early modern period.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books. The writing is beautiful, the descriptions are spot on, the story is fun, and the characters are well drawn. This one is a keeper. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read most of the books by William R. Forstchen and thought they were excellent, but this one is the first that really stood out. This book takes a look at the history of the U.S. from the founding of the nation to the Vietnam War. It shows how American democracy is only possible because of the founding fathers, who fought to preserve the principles of the Constitution. It also looks at what the Founders did to prevent this from happening, which I thought was very interesting. I found the characters in this story to be very good, but it was the book's analysis of the Founders that was the highlight. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been waiting for a good biography of Nelson Rockefeller for a long time. This biography is as good as I've ever heard.  He was a deeply religious man who was also a realist, a thinker, and a real friend. He was also incredibly generous and an incredible philanthropist. Nelson was a very successful businessman and politician who was highly influential in shaping the modern American economy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book.  It gives a wonderful and thorough explanation of the principles of Zen.  The author does not try to teach us Zen in an overly literal or strict way, but explains it using a variety of methods that can be found in any of the other Zen texts.  I particularly liked that the author teaches how to read the Buddha's words in a way that is more natural and intuitive.  He uses his own personal experiences as an example and presents a variety ways of interpreting his words and experiences.  A wonderful book that is essential for understanding Zen.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book on the history of the American republic. It is a tour de force of scholarship, the work of a brilliant and thorough analyst of America's changing political and social culture.  It is also a deeply thought-provoking exploration of the political process, including its shortcomings.  I recommend it without reservation.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be quite interesting. I particularly liked the discussion of the American tendency to seek out and emulate the values of other societies.  It is a very useful concept for people living in modern societies. It can be seen clearly in the behavior of American college students, for example, in the belief that a more civilized society would be more open to freedom of speech and expression and less likely to criminalize sex between adults. This is clearly a bad view in an age of social censorship and repression. If we want to preserve a more enlightened future, then we need to change the attitudes of those who are currently leading our society.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The God that Failed" is a classic of conservative criticism of the New Testament:  Â  It is not so much a condemnation of the book, as of the religion to which the book purports to be a revelation.    The central message of the Gospel of Mark is that Jesus of Nazareth was not divine, that he was an "unclean spirit" that could not even enter the kingdom of heaven until he was circumcised by a priest.  While this message is important and valuable, Mark was writing hundreds of years after Jesus' crucifixion and his resurrection and, according to the Gospels, the apostles had already concluded that Jesus was not "the Messiah."  They did not believe in his divinity because they were aware that his humanity was a limitation, a handicap that was to be overcome. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only downside to this book is the small size of the text. The author explains a lot in the beginning, but there's very little information in the text itself. I found myself skimming back and forth to see what he was getting at. I thought a more detailed summary would have been nice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed The Good Soldier (a great book by the same author), but it's a little less well-written in its prose.  The narrator, Sam, is almost entirely a narrator of his own thoughts.  He is, as the title suggests, very religious and doesn't seem to have much respect for other people's ideas about religion, but he is able to explain what it is about religion he likes and what he doesn't like, which can be a bit jarring.  When he discusses the idea of heaven, he uses this example:  I'm not talking about heaven as some idealistic fantasy: that sort of heaven is so far from the way the world really is that I'd never see it if I lived in it. I'm talking about paradise as it really is.  You've got to see it from the other side.  It's like an upside-down version of the world, the sort of paradise you find in a fairy tale, where the bad guy is a prince, the good guy is the king, and the bad guys are the baddies who have to do the bad things.  Paradise is a lot better than that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great work that is at once accessible and full of thought-provoking insights. In a recent discussion, one of the other participants remarked that most books on philosophy are so dense that they could be read in an hour and never gain a full understanding. In her book, St. Anselm, she asserts that the reason we can read a book in such a short amount of time is that we've acquired a rich vocabulary to use in our discussions:  In this regard, I agree with her: we don't need books that are too dense in order to be successful at philosophy.  (It's not that I think we should read books that aren't dense -- I don't -- I just think that we need the vocabulary, and that's a good thing.)  This book is a great example of what we might call "the rich vocabulary of good philosophy" -- a rich set of words that enable us to make precise, precise, well-reasoned arguments that can be used to illuminate the deepest questions about the meaning of life.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book several years ago, while working for a Christian television network, and was impressed with its approach to biblical scholarship. I was even more impressed with how the authors have expanded the ideas and arguments of the original text into a whole new theological framework. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a history student, I found this book extremely helpful for my class.  Although the topic was new to me, I appreciated the information I was able to access.  The writing style was professional and the author provides clear explanations of important concepts and historical facts.  This will help me as I am preparing my history final exam in December. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I didn't think that the idea of reading something by someone like Joyce and finding something out about them or them themselves was possible.  It's true that I never knew Joyce personally but I have a friend who does and she's been writing her memoirs.  So, I decided to do the same and in the process, I discovered so much.  I find it very interesting that Joyce was an atheist and even though she was an adult during the period in which she wrote, she was a devout atheist at that time.  In addition to that, she also disliked anything involving alcohol or sex because she felt that it took away from her poetry.  She even once said that, because of her spiritual beliefs, she could only write about love and loss without the pain or negative emotions.  For me, this is very interesting because I never know how long a person can stand a lack of happiness or enjoyment for that matter.  But, as far as being a devout, atheist, she seems to have been in a state of constant struggle with that very thing in her life.  There's nothing about her life that suggests that she wanted to do anything but love her family, and yet, despite all that she was doing, she still managed to be a devout woman who was a little upset that she couldn't have a family of her own.  As far as the memoirs are concerned, I've actually been reading them but have always put them down because they just don't interest me.  This time, though, I was willing to give it a shot and it turns out that the people who have really inspired me are people who are in their 60s and 70s and, I think that's what Joyce was in her 70s.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely loved this book! I read it in one sitting last night and found it to be the most engrossing and educational book I've ever read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an absolute gem.  It's a short book, so you could pick it up and read it in one sitting.  The story focuses on two kids, one black and one white, and their lives as a result of the Jim Crow era.  They are raised to be good Americans, but when one becomes a drug addict, the other is a bad influence.   The author does a very good job of giving the characters their own voices, and making it clear that none of them are perfect.  I especially enjoyed the ending, where both kids finally get their shit together, and decide to be better people.  Also, it's pretty cool that both characters got to be in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite part of this book is how it makes use of a quote by the great poet, Walt Whitman: "The trouble with writing about what you know is that what you don't know is so interesting." This quote from Walt Whitman, with its simple yet profound meaning, is one that I've thought about a lot as I've read about Walt Whitman and his poetry. In the book I quoted, Whitman is discussing how he believes that the way to express the world is through poetry. What I loved about this quote from Whitman is how he uses the metaphor that his poems are like books. When someone is talking about reading a book, they are using the same metaphor. A book is an idea that gets stored into your mind and that is a book that you can read as a whole. In a way, Whitman's poems are also like books because they have an idea or idea that get stored into the mind. The idea is not just in the words, but in the whole idea. In this way, all of the poems and quotes in this book are actually the same as Walt Whitman's books.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am new to both the science of weight management and weight loss, and this book is one of the most useful and comprehensive resources I have found on the subject.  In addition, the tone of the book is friendly, empathetic, and encouraging to all of its readers.   The author discusses how the same science, in both scientific and clinical fields, has been applied to many different populations, with many different outcomes, to help people successfully and effectively change their body weight.  It is also a book that discusses the challenges of losing weight and maintaining weight loss - and some of the research and findings that can help us overcome those challenges.  I recommend it highly to all who are interested in pursuing weight loss.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had read one or two good fantasy books before this, but this one takes the cake in every sense.  It's funny, dark and sad.  The language is really well-written.  If you want to read a dark fantasy book and don't want to turn it into a romance novel, this one is perfect.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am writing this review for a book which I have recently read and which I think is essential reading for anyone concerned about the future of liberty.  This book is about the dangers of a large and growing government, and it does a fine job of illustrating the problems by focusing on one recent case: the recent attempt to create a new welfare program for children.  It's a complicated story, but I'm not going to give the details here.  Instead, I'm going to point out the implications for a more libertarian society, which I believe would be one that would be less bureaucratic, and which would be more willing to accept the benefits of an innovative, free society.  First, the author reminds us that government is a powerful instrument for the preservation of freedom.  In a free society, he argues, it is nearly impossible for government to get much done, and thus it needs to be limited to the extent it can be.  While this is undoubtedly true, we should always keep in mind that any effort to limit or destroy liberty inevitably fails, because the people who would oppose freedom are not the ones most willing to be constrained.  That's why the people most able to get government to be as big as it is are those who oppose liberty, and are therefore usually the ones who do the most damage to freedom. If we want a government which can do something useful for our society, then it is necessary that it be limited in the most effective ways.  There's an old adage, "a pen is mightier than a sword," and it is perfectly accurate for government, because of its massive power, to do things that would normally be done by private business.  We need to recognize that the "pens" won't always be in the right place, and the "swords" won t always be available.  So, government can't just do whatever it wants, and we should be ready to adjust the laws accordingly.  However, the question remains: what kind of government should we want?  Obviously, in a free market society, the best solution would be a system which is extremely limited in scope, but which still allows the free market to operate.  A good example of such a system, which is used today in some areas of the US, is the TANF program.  TANFW can be found all over the place, including in Texas, where it has been in existence since 1989.   It essentially provides a

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best non-fiction book on economics I've ever read.   It's not just an analysis of the market, but the whole system that supports it.  As an economist I've come to understand how everything I thought I knew about economics is really just a set of assumptions and prejudices.  Yet I learned something new from this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title says it all. "It's the truth that will set you free." It's exactly what it says. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15. I don't remember a time when I wasn't in a downward spiral. But it took years to get to the bottom of it. That's when I discovered Carl Jung's work and what it meant to be me. Carl Jung was an anthropologist, and he believed that all human beings are not born bad or good. There is a "good energy" that exists inside us that we are just not ready to release. I remember one day in sixth grade, I felt so bad that I was crying uncontrollably. I didn't even realize I was doing it. It felt like I was trying to break out of something. I knew that was the way that I wanted to live my life. But when I got home, I cried like I never had before. I had a dream the next day in which I told everyone at my school that I had been diagnosed with manic depression. It was amazing. I felt different. But that feeling of peace was the thing that brought me back to myself. This book really helps me put it all into words. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure why I waited so long to start this one, I'm sure I will be so bored when it's done with by the end.   It was a bit of a challenge to start off well, but I think I found it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A must-have for any reader interested in ancient Near Eastern history.   The author uses a wide variety of sources, and provides a good overview of the topics he covers.  As an archaeologist, he is excellent at explaining the technical details, and he is also good at explaining why he believes the evidence supports his interpretation.  Overall, this is an excellent book and will stand the test of time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't often write about books, but this one stands out.  It's written in a straightforward style, and yet the depth of thought and insight offered is astonishing. The book addresses a wide range of subjects - from the ways in which we can benefit from a bit of quiet time, to the benefits of being a vegetarian, to why we should be happy to be alive today. It's worth reading in its entirety, and the author's personal take on it is always a nice bonus. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I didn't enjoy the first half of the book very much because I was very bored. I'm a fan of the fantasy genre, but I was tired of the same plotlines over and over again. Fortunately, the second half is much more interesting, and it is well worth the read!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book.  This is a fun, engaging and enjoyable book. It is short and does not require a lot of research.  I like to think that it will also be a good reference work for my class on "Easter traditions in the United States". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have just finished reading the latest book by Stephen R. Covey, entitled The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  A lot of people have recommended it to me.  Covey's book, though a bit dated (he's written several more since then), still holds up as a valuable resource.  He explains in detail how the habits he recommends were developed, and what he sees as the essential traits of highly effective people: humility, openness to change, taking responsibility for their actions, and the ability to forgive others.  I've had several meetings with Covey in the past, and I'm pleased to report that he's one of the most gracious and generous human beings I know.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book on the life and work of Joseph Smith.  The information contained in this book, such as the date of the first vision and the events surrounding it, will prove invaluable to members of the Church when preparing for their mission or for any other activity where they may need to rely on spiritual gifts to help them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had been looking for a book about African American history that I liked.   This one is it.  It was very accurate.  The author was the editor of the New York World newspaper when his newspaper had to print a correction regarding a false statement made in a story about the Ku Klux Klan.  That led to the publication of the book in 1991.  This is a must read book about the civil rights movement for anyone who has any interest in African American experience.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been looking for this book for months and I am so glad I finally did. It will provide the perfect mix of academic history and practical tips for the real world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really glad I got this book: I've been trying to find my way to women's literature for years. For whatever reason, all of my attempts so far have failed. So many times, it seems, the best I can do is watch "How to Win Friends & Influence People" or "The Secret," or, god forbid, read about men's problems in "The New York Times" (because women don't want to hear about men being bad). I'm glad I found this book; it's a great resource for anybody looking for a good story about women's issues. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read The Devil's Dictionary from cover to cover, and it's one of my most favorite books of the year. It is full of interesting facts and fascinating stories, and its author, Michael T. Griffith, manages to write about them in such a way that the information is easily understood and enjoyable. I particularly liked the chapter on the French word "gÃ©nÃ©ral" ("form"), which describes the manner in which a thing is formed from its parts. (The term is derived from the Latin word "genus," but I think it's a better word to describe what it is that forms the parts.) "GÃ©nÃ©riel," Griffith explains, "is the proper way to say a thing when it has been made by hand. It does not mean a'machine' or a 'work of art.' Instead it means the method of making something; how one makes something." This is a brilliant way to think about the book. One of the advantages of a print book, as opposed to an electronic device like a laptop, is that I can read the text and the pictures at the same time, allowing me to easily recall details I missed on the screen. This is especially useful when I'm learning new things.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  I feel like I've heard about her books before but never got the chance to read any.  The description is spot on and gives a lot of insight into the background, writing process, and themes that would be presented in the text. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most important thing that I took away from this book was that all of the negative aspects of the book can be overlooked if you understand and understand the positive side, as well.  That's a bit of a mouthful, but I'll try:  First, the narrator is extremely sympathetic.  She's so much more interesting than the main character, and it was a bit disheartening to find her less-than-sympathetic attitude toward him, but it made her character and the book so much better  Second, the book is very well researched, and there's lots of great quotes and tidbits that add to the story.  Third, the story's plot and characters are very well-paced, so you don't have to keep turning pages to find the next interesting tidbit.  Fourth, the ending of the story is unexpected and leaves you wishing for more, which I think is the most important aspect of this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had an interesting experience with this book.  It's very well written and informative. I was amazed at how this author has taken her experiences in a clinical setting and made it accessible to the layperson.  I learned quite a bit about OCD.  If you are suffering from it and want to understand it better, this is a great place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked it a lot and I'm looking forward to reading the other books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating and important book by a world-class historian that makes a very convincing case that the end of the Ottoman Empire in the mid-twentieth century was not, in fact, the end for the Arabs, or even for Islam. The empire was never truly defeated and the Arabs have never fully recovered their pre-Ottoman power. As long as the region is the theater of regional war, this book makes a valuable contribution.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, David Llewellyn presents his best analysis of the economic system that has dominated our civilization for more than 2,000 years. We are faced with the prospect of a major change in the social and political order of our society that could be called the Great Transitional Change. This is the point where a whole host of economic changes will occur and when it all comes crashing down.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book the author demonstrates that there is always hope for those who are fighting in the trenches of life. I am a former Vietnam veteran who, at least during my first deployments to the Middle East, was a fairly well-known and respected figure within the U.S. military. In addition to the fact that I am now retired and living in the small town of New Jersey where I live, I can say that I was also a major problem for the Iraqi insurgency, because I was both too outspoken in my opposition to the American occupation and too stupid to understand it. I thought that the Iraqis had to have it coming, and that the Americans were trying to take over their country. In spite of my opposition, the Bush administration was determined to overthrow Saddam, and it was not until I returned home from my last deployment in Iraq in February 2006 that I realized that the invasion of Iraq was a bad idea. I was so furious at what I had seen that I immediately went on the radio and denounced it on the air. Shortly after that I decided to resign from the Army. I found that I had to do something to make a difference in the world, and I decided that I could not sit idly by and watch the world destroy itself. In the fall of 2006, I took a chance on a book by a Vietnam vet named Dave Grossman. I bought his book on the recommendation of a friend and he became my hero. After reading Grossman's book I realized what a massive fuck-up I had been. Grossman made a few mistakes, but they are not nearly as big as my stupid behavior. He helped me understand the reasons for my opposition and he also made me realize that my stupid beliefs were not the only reason I opposed the war. Although I still disagree with his conclusions, I will always remember Dave Grossmen's book as a crucial part of my recovery.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in preparation for my trip to Germany. It's a wonderful description of the culture, the language and even the history.   The best part is that the book has pictures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed reading this book.   It offers an interesting perspective on a variety of topics and brings up important issues in a very good way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just finished "The New Class" by James P. Hogan.  Hogan, one of America's leading experts on education reform, offers a convincing critique of what he terms the failed policies of the last generation of American education reformers. Â The result is a coherent and well-constructed analysis of why we have had to suffer from a wave of disastrous school reform programs over the last few decades, and what should be done differently now.  The subtitle of the book is "Educators and the Failed Dream," and I can see why Hogan would be concerned.  While the vast majority of American children do pretty well in American public schools today, they are not doing so by choice.  Rather, their parents are being driven into poverty to keep them in school.  If the schools they attend are not delivering on their promise of a "good education," then it's no surprise that children have to drop out.  This is true of many of the major reforms that have been attempted over the years, and there are many reasons why these efforts have failed.  Many reforms are poorly designed.  They may have an impact in getting kids to read and do math better, but they do not change the basic conditions that cause many kids to drop-out in the first place.  Other reforms have not reduced the number of children who get left behind in the system, so they don't reduce the burden of educating the kids who remain.  In any case, the result of these failed reforms has been that children spend far more time in poverty than their peers in other countries, and that's a problem.  Even the reforms that do succeed, such as charter schools and voucher programs, can result in more educational stagnation than is warranted.  I also think Hogan's analysis is worth considering.  A lot of the American education "experts" who wrote the 2000 report by the National Commission on Excellence in Education called for more research on "best practices" for improving education.  But the commission itself recommended that we stop spending so much money on research on education. Hogan says that the commission got it right. Â  "The United States has a serious problem with poor outcomes in education," he says. "The answer to the problems in our public schools is not more research or more innovation, it is a change in direction." Â  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've recently read an old book called The Great Awakening, which is very much like this one.  Both books were written in the last decade of the 19th century, and both have to do with religious revival and spiritual awakening.  I have never really read a book that so clearly described and described so clearly and so clearly how to have a spiritual awakening in the first place, and how it happens.  It's not something that happens suddenly, like if you're hit by lightning.  The Awakening happens when we start to see the world from the inside.  You just have to sit down and feel it, and feel the emotions that arise.  So you have to get in the moment, and get a little out of the moment.  This is very different from trying to force spiritual awakening by force, which most people have tried to do, and not succeeding. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so thankful for this book. I grew up loving Dr. Seuss, but he never really appealed to me as a child. I just found his books to be boring and juvenile. When I got interested in reading about him as an adult, I found a book that was far more interesting. This one is even better. This is the most enjoyable book I have read since I started reading Dr. John Seigenthaler's "The Human Stain" a few years ago. It's so full of so much original insight, it's hard to put down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book a lot.  It is good, and you get some really good ideas from it.  I'm not really familiar with modern mathematics, but it seems to me that many of the ideas are very modern indeed.  This book is a good source of ideas for students of mathematics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very helpful and extremely entertaining. You can tell that these authors really enjoyed their time in India and really got to know their subject.  It will also be interesting to see what other interesting things these authors will find. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book, and my kids really enjoyed it as well. I read it as a kind of pre-reading guide so they wouldn't be confused, and I found it really helpful. I highly recommend this one!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so easy and so good that I can get it in my Kindle and finish it in half a day.   It's about three years after the events of the book -- and I had never thought to look for the man behind the events.  I didn't know how to tell him that I wanted to thank him but didn't really know what to say.  Then he started telling me his stories.  And he told me the stories of a lot of people who had been in that war. I didn 't know who those people were but I did know that they were people.  These people were so real and so very real.  They were people who were trying to protect themselves.  If they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, they wanted to get out and never come back.  Even if they did know what they were doing, I felt bad for them.  The best thing I learned from this book is that people are people.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy this book.  The story is very unique, but not just a story about a girl who learns she has a demon in her.  There is also a little bit of science in the story.  This story is told from the point of view of a character that is possessed.  I think the most interesting aspect of this story is the way it shows that possession can happen to anyone, not just people that have a lot of demons.  Another thing I like is that the main character does not give up.  She is determined to learn more about her possession so she can help others.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is written with great detail and is very interesting.  It also includes some great recipes that would make great gifts for a child. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this in a week and loved it so much. The writing is clear, and the story is fun and exciting.  A lot of books are written by people who are too embarrassed to tell the truth about themselves or the world around them, but this book by Ramez Naam is different. Naam's life is colorful and full of adventure and success, and he's honest about how he got there.  I really enjoyed his thoughts and opinions on a lot of things, and I was surprised at how much of an underdog he was.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was an excellent resource for my graduate study in comparative religion.  The depth of the research, especially the research of scholars who have been at work for several decades, is impressive.  Many of the books reviewed in the book have been published by the same authors or by similar academic presses, but they are well written, informative, and have a very diverse subject matter.  I can easily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about comparative religion and the history of Christianity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book with interest and pleasure, and found it to be as much about the experiences of people with ADHD as it was about the illness itself. The authors were able to write a sympathetic and empathetic portrayal of the challenges that people with the condition face in both private and public situations, as well as a series of advice and suggestions for coping that are both helpful and not. The book is very accessible and should be considered for all children and teens who suffer from ADHD, not just those who seek professional treatment for the disorder. It's hard for us adults to appreciate how hard it can be to be in the same room as someone with ADHD (especially if he or she is a loved one), and even harder still to imagine how it might be to lose one's job or lose control of their finances due to their condition. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so pleased with this book.   It's been so long that I remember not knowing much about the subject matter. But here we are, with The Girl on the Train and a plethora of other books that make the same point.  It makes sense to use a historical example to make a point about an important contemporary issue (a common argument from feminist philosophers).  The problem is, it's a good historical example that doesn't explain the issues at all.  Instead, it just makes the point that it's still hard to talk about the differences between men and women in polite conversation (and much more complicated when we're talking about sexual assault, gender roles, etc.)  I also wish it had had more focus on the women who worked with him, as a psychologist (and a very nice one at that).  It also doesn't really discuss the differences in the ways men and boys are treated in schools, nor does it discuss the ways in which women's and girls' schools are treated. Â  In short, it would have benefited from a more detailed discussion of the specific concerns that feminism has had with this topic over time.
Write a positive review about a good book:    There's a lot going on in this novel but it all works well in a well-oiled machine: the characters are interesting (with the exception of the two main ones, who can be described as both archetypes and boring) and the prose is smooth as silk.  It's a book that gets better the more you think about it, a classic that stays with you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really enjoying The Story of My Teeth and the Tooth Fairy. It's one of my favorite books of all time and I have an unquenchable love for children's books.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have had the pleasure of listening to many of Breslow's books, and he's never disappointed me. I can't believe I've only just started this one.  Breslows' voice is very calm and very confident, but his advice is always wise and solid. I'm always happy to read about a new practice or idea that others are already putting into practice.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had many of the books by this author and I've always loved them.   This one is the first one that I've read in the series that I'm not completely dissatisfied with.  It's very well written and has many wonderful insights about religion, education, the importance of family, and so forth.  This is probably my favorite book in the entire series, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in reading about the Bible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second half of the book, particularly chapter four, is just mind boggling.  What's really incredible is that it was written with a female perspective. Â There's a lot of the same general ideas in the earlier chapters that are also here -- women's ability to be independent, take charge and handle a challenge is a strength, as is their ability to overcome adversity and be effective.  This is only the beginning, though.  It's not all about womanhood, of course, but it's about women's potential for whatever their gender may be called.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book for those who desire to develop self-control and who wish to become happier and more disciplined.   The author's success with this strategy was so impressive that he went on to help start a number of successful businesses that are still in existence today.  The exercises in this book are very helpful and are based on principles that have proven effective in the real world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is hard to put into words how much this book has affected me and I hope it does for the next few months. I'm a very happy woman!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great novel. A very well-crafted novel. This is the story of the boy who never got to grow up but had to live through life with the knowledge of death. He learns to love life because of it. He learned that people are still people and have all the same weaknesses. He also learns that people who are willing to do the right thing, don't have to live in the past. The ending is bittersweet. I don't know how he gets out of the mess he got into. But it doesn't have anything to do with him. It has to do more with the adults who don't care about the pain the past causes, and don't seem to care about him being here. He can't seem go back to them because they don't want him there.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read many of the Harry Potter series, and I loved them all. But this is the first that I really enjoyed. Although I am not sure I would go back to that book in a second time to finish it, this one has enough character development and plot development that I am interested in what will happen next.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can't say I found this book to be an all-around entertaining read, but I did find it to be a rather fascinating look at the historical process of how a major text by a major literary figure (which was, after all, written by a very famous author) came into being.    While I don't think I'd agree that the story is particularly surprising or relevant, I did learn a few things that are of interest to me, some of which had come from my own personal experience of the process. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in three sittings and enjoyed every one. It's a very good introduction to how we come to make decisions in our lives.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read this book and enjoyed it.  It's a good one and I'm glad I purchased it. The only flaw I found is that the author doesn't use the book for her writing class.  I understand that she wants her students to understand what she's written.  However, I don't think it's necessary for all of them to read every chapter for each section.  Perhaps I would have been better off using this book as the first in a series of books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My first book, The Last Testament, was a great read. It was filled with history and analysis, but the book was also funny and had a good message. This second book was even better! I found the book interesting and challenging in ways that The Last Bible was not. The stories were interesting as well as the questions about God and the Bible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so excited about this book, I ordered it from a bookstore so I could finally read it.  Unfortunately, I can't quite get into it, though I like the writing.  I found myself wishing there was more discussion of the origins and meaning of the English language, but I can accept the "weird" characters/world view that they present.  Hopefully, that will become part of the larger conversation on language and culture in the future, so I will continue to read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love reading about the early history of the United States.  I particularly love books about the beginnings of the railroad in the U.S., the beginnings and progress of the first railroads in the East, and the history of New England.  The only problem with this book is that it is written in the third person.  As such, it makes the book very difficult to read.  However, the author did a great job of conveying the information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as part of an early morning morning class for university students.  I have been studying Buddhism for about a decade now and found that the Buddha's teachings are very practical and very easy to apply.  However, I was surprised that he often uses metaphors that could easily be translated in everyday language into more poetic language (although I'm sure they are meant to be serious).  The one that particularly caught my attention was his description of "being in the state of 'full wakefulness'" (Dhammapada:7)  The translation here isn't too far off:  In this state, you are "woke," you are fully awake and aware of everything, and you know everything perfectly, as it really is.  There's no sense of being in sleep anymore, or having a dream.  You're "awake." Â  I guess he was trying to say that we should always be fully awake at all times.  The most interesting part of this passage is that it's a good reminder of the importance of not being distracted.  We are in this state of "full wakefulness" for the purpose of meditating, not for fun.  In other words, mindfulness and meditation aren't about being able to relax and have fun.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been highly recommended to me by my friends. It is not just a history of the Second World War. It covers a lot more ground, and the information provided is often extremely valuable in understanding the history of war in general.  The book begins with the first world war, then examines the Korean and Vietnam wars.  For those interested in how history is made, and how much is true about what happened, this is a must read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has a great structure. It was well-organized, and I was able to pick out important information easily. It's a nice introduction to the field of neuroimaging. I think we all need a good intro to the subject to make the most of this technology. If you have never taken an MRI before, or even if you have, it would be helpful to have something to help you understand the process. This book is written in a way that would be easy to understand, but that would also make it easier for you to understand. It would be a good resource for someone who is doing their first MRI.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The   is not only one of the best books I've read this year, but it's one of my favorite books of all time.  I  don't like to do lists like that for fun, but   I'd  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book at college and loved it. I have loved all her books, including her earlier ones, but this one had me hooked from the start.   The story is simple and straightforward, but the way it is told is the most intriguing aspect.  She writes the action with such speed that you feel like the action is happening in your head.  I found myself reading this book three times a day, and each time I was eager to start the next one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite of John Darnielle's books  (the last was The Mountain Goats: The Best American Folk Songs,   I highly recommend this and John D. Darnille is an extremely talented singer and guitarist. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be a very valuable introduction to the theory of evolution by natural selection, especially in relation to sexual selection.  It is interesting, well written, and well supported with many references.  I recommend it highly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book while sitting in the library. I was intrigued by the story about a man who went to a friend's house and was shot in the head and had to live with it until he died. The friend then said that he had to shoot himself, too, because he didn't want to live after his wife left him. I thought about this story as I was reading and found it very compelling. I've been thinking about this case quite a bit and wanted to write a positive book about it. The author does a wonderful job of describing what happened, while also providing some fascinating information on the man's wife, her children, and the family of the friend he'd met. The last sentence of the book says, "In his final years, my friend would make frequent trips back to the site of his shooting, where he would look at the bullet and contemplate the nature of death. One night he stopped on the way, and asked the next morning's newspaper, 'Did I really die?'  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am really glad I read this book. It's a very important book to anyone who has ever had children or is considering having children, especially now that my own is growing up. It explains why having children at a certain age is a very good thing. And it is an excellent book about what we can do with our time and money. It should be required reading for every woman and man who is planning to have children or who is going through infertility. I also like that it gives advice on getting along with other parents. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been interested in learning how to write since I was a young girl, but it was very difficult at the beginning.  I got frustrated with myself and would not write a word.  Eventually, I got motivated and started taking classes at the local public library, which really helped me realize that writing is fun.   It is also a great way to spend a summer, with my family and friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first foray into science fiction, and I've found it more enjoyable than any other genre. I found the writing to be extremely tight and the plot to be consistent, although a bit vague in some places. The characters and the world-building were both intriguing and believable. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read and enjoyed quite a few of the historical fiction books in this series by Deborah J Ross, and this one fits in with the group. I liked the character of Mary Anne Schoeffler, who was in my opinion the most interesting in the group, although she isn't particularly likable. The plot is a bit predictable and I am not sure how much I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is fascinating and has great depth. I didn't realise just how much history is being ignored in this book. It's amazing how little is taught about many of the greatest people, including:  Julius Caesar, Moses, and Christ! The author mentions how a majority of scholars believe that the Egyptians built the pyramids to store grain and that they were not built to store gold, but it is a small portion of his book. The book includes a great discussion on how the Bible has influenced modern day culture and history. The author states, "There are those who believe that many of our cultural taboos are derived from the Bible. They believe that some people, such as homosexuality, bestiality, or premarital sex, are simply God's laws not to be broken. We can, and should, accept these cultural tablaws as they come, but we should not try to change or alter them. It is, therefore, a good thing for us to realize that the Bible is not the only source of laws and morals. As the great theologian C. S. Lewis pointed out, we can derive most moral codes from Scripture. Our culture is much more varied than the Bible makes it out to be, but the moral code found in Scripture is far better than the moral codes found elsewhere."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about the lives of eight children whose parents have been in and out of prison. It focuses on their relationships with their parents and the impact of their parents' imprisonment.  They are the children of women who were convicted for murder, and the mother's is a sad one.  It is also the story of one of the children's mothers, who was raised by a single mother. The children are also very young, and at the end of the book, I found it hard to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very excited to start reading The Good Men Project. A new book I'm enjoying is This is Why You're Single by Elizabeth Gilbert. Both are excellent reads, but I found that Gilbert's book is more accessible, funny and timely. This one will be right up there with it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author does a superb job of weaving together the various characters in this book. As a result, it's easy to become attached to them. Each character is developed and portrayed as a human being, with good and bad points, and they all feel quite real to read about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book on what you can do to learn how to live better. It's filled with practical tips on how to improve your physical and mental health, how to prepare better for your life and relationships, how much you love your life, and how to manage your emotions and self-esteem. The author even shares with you some tips on the best things to do at each age.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   In short, this book was so good I don't know where to begin. It is a tour de force of science fiction.  The stories that followed were some of the best sci-fi stories I've ever read.  In a very positive way.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at a public library for a college class. The book is not just about military science, however. It covers everything from history to literature and social sciences.  It provides a good overview of the subject matter, and it's clear how important it is to the military.  I think this would be a great book for a high school or middle school class to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters are the real stars of this story. My favorite is the narrator who seems to be able to capture what is going on in every character's head. The other characters are great as well. The action scenes are some of the best I've ever read. I loved that all of them are very likable and not at all the evil villains that you often find in this genre. There are a few that I didn't like very much, but most of them have a great point in the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a professional reviewer for many years. I have bought and read numerous self-help books. Many of them, despite their promise, are just more of the same old stuff. These are different. This one really stood out to me. I am not a great believer in using psychology to improve my life. I believe, however, that the more one understands about psychology, the more they can benefit others. This book is a great introduction to that. It is also a great gift, for a newbie or for a long-time skeptic like me.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author of this book was very informative and very thorough. I especially liked his analysis of the role of religion in American politics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very impressed by this book. It is a wonderful account of the trials and tribulations of the Russian Revolution from the point of view of the leading figures, and it offers a detailed history of Bolshevik politics from 1905 to 1917. It also provides an extremely well-researched and informative introduction to the history of the Bolshevik party.   This is one of those books that is essential reading for anyone interested in the Russian revolution.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The   story of one family's journey from the poverty of India to the U.S.A. and all the challenges they have faced is a beautiful one. This is not a book that has the same impact on a reader as it does on the author, but it is a story that I will keep in my heart.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be a good, but not outstanding, book. I found it interesting and stimulating, and I found myself thinking about certain issues while reading, but I was never particularly moved. It seemed to me that the authors had their heads in the clouds with regard to the future, which I found a bit odd since I myself believe that the most important things to do in the present are to enjoy life, develop relationships with people, and focus on one's career. The only good thing I did come away with from this book was the fact that the author was able to convey a lot of information in a relatively short period of time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like the way Cormac McCarthy writes, you'll like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read in a long time. It is a combination of history and science, and I found it both very interesting and also useful.   I read it on my Kindle and it is extremely easy to use.  There are many good photos as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have ever read on how to handle a nervous breakdown. It's the kind of book that you put down and think, "That was really helpful." It explains the common symptoms, causes, and ways of overcoming them.   It's also very practical and practical.  The chapter on how people handle nervous breakdowns really helped me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful read on the history of the Bible. It is a good history and shows how the Bible has evolved over the centuries to meet current culture. Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the second in the series about the life of Jesus. I loved the first book. This one is a bit shorter. Still, it is good. It is good in a non-religious way and I don't know why so many people can't grasp the truth about Jesus. If you can get past the non-Christian parts (such as his sexual adventures, his religious hypocrisy, his love of money, etc.) you will find a wonderful story about a man who loved, and was loved by, others.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found myself reading a lot of this book, and having some very good ideas about some of the problems with our society. I particularly liked her argument that the "recovery" that we've been experiencing is not really recovery. She makes an excellent point about the increasing cost of health care, which isn't necessarily caused by economic conditions but is due to increasing expenses for things like insurance and medicine, which are increasingly difficult to get even with a healthy lifestyle. Another very important point she makes is the increasing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on our society and our health. There are some excellent observations about the increased need for drugs in our society, from how we have to buy so many of them to the very significant price of prescription drugs that are given to cancer patients. In a very short book, she manages to make a lot about very little, while still presenting a lot that is quite good.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book as it is a great read about the history of American music and how it affected people in the past. I love reading history books about other people, especially about history I don't fully understand, and this book was interesting for that reason. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! Â The style is very engaging, yet it is simple enough for a layperson to understand.   It is great to read and really has some deep insight into how men think and behave. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleased with this book.  It gives a detailed description of how a good writing course helped me get my writing down.  The exercises provided a great model for my own writing and helped me see the relationship between language, grammar and meaning.  I'm glad I took the classes.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book an invaluable addition to my library of reference material.  It's a very readable book that brings the reader into contact with many of the important, but underappreciated, cultural and historical facts surrounding the American Revolution.  This is certainly one of the most interesting history books I have encountered in recent years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had this book recommended to me by my teacher at an adult education class we were conducting. It was a good overview of the major religions and was very well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be excellent in a number of respects: well researched, full of original insight, well written, interesting, and compelling.   A wonderful, non-controversial book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! This is a nice blend of practical science and philosophy that is well-executed and easy to read. It's a bit dated, but the concepts and reasoning are still valid. It helps me to understand why I'm in anaphylactic shock in the mornings, and why I don't want to go out in public in those instances. Also, the book makes great use of examples from history. You can see how science can be applied to real-life problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's about my dog, whom I adopted from the local shelter in March 2011, and who has been my best friend for three years.  She's a big, lovable, sweetheart.  There's a lot of emotional depth in the book: her struggle with allergies, being abandoned by a human family, and learning to live on her own.  My dog loves to listen to music, so I'm especially glad to have a copy.  I would have recommended it to anyone who's had a dog -- I've read about other books on the subject, and I found them pretty dry and predictable.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little worried about this book. I have read most of the feminist fiction out there and I tend to shy away from the "good" books because I'm not sure I want to be lectured by "good feminist women".  This book seems to be a bit more lighthearted and humorous.  The writing style seems like a good fit with the topics.  I've also found that the writing is quite interesting.  It's very different from the standard "woman-blaming"  I have seen.  "A young feminist" isn't a bad title. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book interesting and well written, but it is not necessarily one that I would recommend to my friends or to my students.   The story is about a college student and her relationship with an alien life form, but there is little to nothing about the alien itself.  If you have a friend who is an avid reader, you might find this book a useful addition to the list, but if you're an avid student and don't read much, I'm afraid you may not find much to interest you in this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a teenager, I used to get really excited about books that seemed to show the way the world really was, that even in the most terrible times and places there would be hope and beauty. This was one of the few that I could find that did. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a review and liked it very much. I haven't written a review since I finished a very long book, so this is my first.  The book starts with an introduction by a famous psychoanalyst, and I found it really interesting that this guy was so popular during the late 1960s/early 1970s because the book he wrote, The Secret Life of the Unconscious, predicted a lot of things that are now coming true.  A very successful book that made a lot people wealthy in the 1970s.  Then we get a discussion about what is happening to America, and a lot comes to the surface in the second chapter.  After the first half of the book we hear about the Vietnam War, the birth of the New Left and other social movements.  All of a sudden I find that I have forgotten most of what I read earlier.  It was really a good way to get a new perspective on what is going on.  This is very good material for anyone who is interested in how things really are in this country. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in preparation for my college entrance exams. It has helped me a lot.   It was very informative and useful.  It's well written and the illustrations are great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't usually do books on the Civil War that cover the period from the end of the war in 1865 to 1865. I don`t normally read books that have the title `The War of the Confederates` written in the title, and I haven`t read one that goes to the war`s end.   This book was recommended to me by my good friend and her husband.  I`ve always been interested in the Civil war, and have read many books on it, but none have been able to do justice to the scope and the magnitude of what happened.  The war was over 200 years ago, and the country is still adjusting to the loss of so many loved ones.  And while people have written about the war from many angles, I think that in my opinion, nothing compares to this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a pleasure to read. I've been very interested in Buddhism and the concept of "nontraditional" Buddhism for a while, but it hasn't been easy finding a book that actually goes into those details. This one is definitely the way to go. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read for anyone who is interested in the origins of the American Constitution. The authors are not scholars of American law, but a group of young, law students who got together in the late 1970s to discuss issues that interested them. Although the material is not new, it provides an interesting history of the debates. I enjoyed reading it and am happy that it is being published. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book because it was a recommended "best of" list in a book review section of my local library.  There were so many good recommendations, so I decided to grab the one about reading.  I was very interested in this book, and glad I bought it.   This was my first experience with a nonfiction book, as I am an aspiring writer.  The writing was good.  It took me longer to get into this book than the others, but the writing was more detailed and interesting than the other books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.  The story was well done and the characters were likable and interesting. I really enjoyed reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read about one of the most famous American characters of all time.  A good, informative and entertaining read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a fantastic book. It was a revelation to me about the way in which people use religion to rationalize their failings and to justify their beliefs.  It showed how these people are not really religious at all. They're just people who have been brainwashed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book explains the various kinds of cultural exchange in China, and the various ways in which cultural differences play out.  It is well written and informative.  I found myself especially interested in the relationship between culture and gender differences. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a young adult raised in the Church, I was never a huge fan of the Book of Mormon and only really enjoyed some of the other things Joseph Smith did. When I finished reading this book, I felt as if I had just opened a window into a past life. It really was that good!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's hard to put down, but I do... the writing is clear, succinct, and full of interesting facts and interesting anecdotes.  The information on the history of the world and how it came to be as it is today is fascinating and very well documented. Â In addition, there are some very interesting and thought-provoking discussions about the ethics and politics of using animals for food and how this applies to people as well.   I learned more about myself by reading this book than any book I've ever read before. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a bit of a luddite. I can't stand computers or any kind of digital devices. I use my phone for text, emails, GPS, music, email, etc. I don't use my computer at all for my writing. But this book has made me switch.  For one thing, the formatting is very good.  It uses the same typeface for every chapter, and has footnotes that are easy to find.  I also like that they used a typeface I can read. It's easy to make the word "thrive" mean different things to different people.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book on American history from a libertarian point of view. It is a must read for anyone who is interested in a history of America, or wants to understand the reasons why the United States has become such a powerful and influential nation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much. It's an excellent primer for anyone who has ever wanted to learn to code in Perl.  I'm a beginner and I didn't know much about it at the time, so this book was a very valuable source of information.  My favorite aspect of the book is that it covers just about every aspect of Perl programming in a very short amount of time.  It explains Perl syntax, how to use the language, and explains the various features of Perl. I'm particularly fond of the section on string manipulation.  This was a great way to spend an afternoon. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A highly recommended book, especially for those who feel they have lost their faith.  I had read a number of books by people who had been excommunicated, but this one gave me a very real sense of where I was.  It was a real wake-up call.  This has helped me see that what I believe, I cannot be wrong about, that I am being led by a higher power, that there is a better way than the way I was taught.  In fact, I have been teaching this gospel in my home all these years and have found no reason to be excommunicable.  If that makes me an apostate, that is just fine with me.   I will simply continue on in the same spirit that brought me to this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not so much a fan of memoirs as I am of nonfiction. I find memoirs to be too often full of half-truths and unreliable narrators to be very convincing. I'm glad that this book, while not a memoir in the traditional sense, is about something that I know: the history of the Holocaust. I learned a lot about the Holocaust, both as a Jewish child in Poland and as a Holocaust survivor in New York. I can't imagine the horrors my mother suffered during the years that followed, but it's good that there are others who are still alive to tell their stories, so that they, too, can help prevent future tragedies.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had heard about this book before but had never read it.  It seemed so interesting that I finally decided to try it out.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the conclusion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am trying to become a more skilled writer, and The Writer's Handy Book has helped me immensely. The writing tips and tricks in the book include: using proper punctuation to improve your writing, writing a brief synopsis of an important story, and the "four ways to write with style". I am going to try to write as much as I can in one night, with these tips in mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If I could only read one book this year, this would be it 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book very much. As an undergraduate in English I was interested in the historical and philosophical aspects of the English language. This book provides excellent historical and linguistic information for an undergraduate as well as a general reader. The discussion of the various ways in which the English form has been changed and corrupted since the time of Shakespeare is a wonderful and entertaining part of the book. The bibliographic information is especially helpful for those interested in this topic. It is also interesting to note the influence of French words in the English-speaking world. The book is also well written and the author does a good job of describing what is being discussed in each chapter.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely loved this book.  I've been an avid reader since high school.  At one point, I had bought so many books I could have a library of my own.  This one is great.   It's been a couple of years since I read the book, and I have to confess:  I didn't really understand everything in it.  In fact, the ending took me by surprise.  That's the first time I've ever read a book that I found completely incomprehensible.  Still, it's a great book, highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The last two books I've read have been a little disappointing.  In my opinion, they both miss the point.  Unfortunately, I think I'm finally getting there, and these books just didn't get me there.  Maybe it's a bad sign that the second book that I've just finished in this series, "The Night Angel Trilogy"   has only gotten a single star rating, but I don't see how the first two books can be both so bad.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in the mood for a "real" book, one about human beings. Instead I got "The Art of Human Hacking" (which is good, but not exactly the same) and "I am Malala" (essentially a memoir of the life of Malala Yousafzai ). I'm still trying to figure out whether it is more annoying or annoyingness that is the issue, and what the author means when she says that she wanted to write "an interesting memoir with a lot of laughs" or something more profound. In this case, the book is neither interesting nor profound, but it's not even really about the book, which is kind of odd since I'm kind of interested in reading her memoir. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In my opinion, this is the greatest work of nonfiction ever written.   It is so profound that I have never been able to put it down, and I am still not sure I ever will.  I know that there are many books that are better than this one, but I think it is a rare book that you can take off the shelf, open it to the last page, and say, "I have to do that for the rest of my life."  Thank you, Mr. Bittel, for taking all of the necessary steps to make this book as valuable as it is.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is not just an introduction to an important topic -- it's a great introduction to how people learn best.   It's a little hard to get a grasp of exactly how learning works without having studied the topic, but it's worth the effort.  There's an intriguing mix of anecdotes and data that I've used and found useful in my own work.  I'm a big fan of David Eagleman's book ( http://www.brianjones.org/books/ ) and was a fan of John McAdams' book (http://www2.ncsu.edu/hq/doc/JMA/ ), but I found these books more practical in their ability to teach rather than providing a comprehensive treatise on learning. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's the kind of book you might get through a friend's e-reader and then remember the whole time you've been in it. It's easy to read; easy to relate to; and even easy to recommend.    For example:  The story begins with a young girl, Rose, being taken from her bed in a strange house in the middle of the night. She is a runaway, a runaway from her father, a father who has not seen her for years. Her mother and an aunt were murdered in the night, and the girl's older brother, Tom, has moved in to make sure she doesn't run away again. And it's not just Tom who's concerned about Rose. Her own friends have become worried about her.  The narrator is called L.A. Jones, and he is a man who was raised in the house Rose and her mother and aunt were killed in, and was also friends with Rose's dad when they were young. He's also the reason why Rose and Tom aren't alone in their house. He makes sure that the children stay out of trouble and stay in school. He also makes sure Tom doesn't go wandering off at night.  He keeps Tom out of danger, too.  And he's very helpful to Tom.  "I'm an uncle and I was raised to be a guardian," he says. "I protect."  That's the best way to describe this book. It isn't the kind that's going to make you cry; it isn't going to fill you with nostalgia; it's just going to be plain enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't usually read memoirs but this one seemed well written and I found myself laughing out loud many times as I tried to wrap my mind around the story. I've had a lot of good reading experiences over the years but this was very memorable and made me want to read more about that subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! I also enjoyed "The Best of the Best of Women" by Judy Blume.   A great blend of humor and insight, these two books are great examples of what I love about children's books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It's a collection of essays about a wide variety of topics: the history of women in the sciences, the effects of sexism on science, the differences between women and men in the STEM fields, and how women have tried to overcome that disadvantage. The essays, although different in tone and focus, are written in a conversational and easy to read style that is easy to follow.  While not perfect, the essays are a very good addition to a growing library of science, technology, and feminist literature.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a more balanced and comprehensive exploration of women and science.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The Great Book of Modern English Usage" has already been touted as a classic. If only it were so! I'm a native speaker of the language and found this book useful in answering my questions about how to write in the  I'm so glad that I finally found it! I'd heard of the author, but never picked up a copy. Ifonly it wereso! I'm a native learner of the , so it was nice to get a refresher course. I'm even more thankful that I found the book before the "new" edicts from "Oxford University Press" came out 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just finished reading This Book About Love by a brilliant author, Jodi Picoult, and found it so compelling I decided to do a follow-up review. It's not just the sex scenes that make this book so good - which are plenty in my experience (the sex in this book was even better than in the book that made me become a writer. You'd swear Picoult was a sex addict. It was hard not to read this book while I was doing my best to sleep last night.) It's also Picoult's smart writing. She isn't afraid to go beyond the usual "I told you so" responses in a book about one particular experience - she'll admit the book wasn't a great read for her, or for most of us, but she never lets you feel like you've been let down by her. She even suggests a book or two to try instead, like Love in a Time of War or The Sex Lives of Strangers. This book really does stand up on its own merits. I can't wait to read another!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm still reeling over the book: a simple but important story of love, betrayal, and resilience.   It's a story that I've been trying to come to grips with, and it was very informative and inspiring, and will be my go-to book for this subject for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed the book so much, that I bought the Kindle edition right away.  I am a huge fan of sci-fi. I am especially a fan of the "soft" science fiction, like Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica.  Star Trek had very solid science to back up its claims of "impossible" space travel.  Battlestargal was a huge improvement over the original series, and I loved it as a child.  The books I've read about this show ( Star Trek Continues, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Treks: Deep Space Nine, Star Wars ) have all been great as well.  But now we have this new series, which I loved, and which I intend to finish.  It will probably be my only science fiction series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received a copy of this book from NetGalley as a review copy.  I was a bit skeptical about this book, as many of my previous experiences with romance novels had ended badly, but I was pleasantly surprised with it.  It was well written, easy to follow, and I enjoyed the overall message.  The character development was good, and the ending was very satisfying.  Definitely recommend it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had read the previous books by the authors, and this book didn't seem to change any of the previous work in any significant way.  There were some improvements to the analysis of the effects of music, particularly in the "musical imagination."  There was also a bit more discussion about "mental imaging," which was very interesting.  The authors suggest that musical training should be used more as a tool to improve mental images rather than as a source of new ideas.  They also suggest that a more general mental training program is necessary, such as teaching a child to read.  That seems like an improvement over the previous book, but I'm glad to see the authors take their own advice to heart.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently read this book after hearing about it on the radio. I've been searching for a good alternative to the more traditional approach to studying languages for some time and I've found it. This book is accessible, practical, and full of excellent insight. It makes perfect sense. I can see myself using it as a teaching aid and reference when I study other languages. The fact that it is based on a real interview makes it much more compelling than most books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In contrast to much of what is being written about Islam, I really enjoyed this book. It describes the religion in clear and concise terms, and it's easy to get the picture that most Muslims would find very appealing. As the author notes, "The book's title is a reference to how some scholars have written about the Qur'an, and the emphasis of the Quranic verses is not on theological speculation, but on their practical application. They focus on the practical, on how to live the good, moral life; how to be kind, considerate, loving, loyal, courageous, forgiving, etc. While many of these things are part of a true religion, the QurÊ¾an's focus on these good, kind, compassionate traits is what makes it so special, so different from Christianity, Judaism, or even Hinduism.""
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, as I have enjoyed many of the others by the same author. This is the first in a series and, like the others, I've enjoyed each one, although I've felt more than a bit cheated when the author does not acknowledge my previous purchases of these books.  The characters are strong, with a few exceptions (more on them later), and, I think, the setting is unique (though perhaps too remote from the contemporary US in the earlier books).  The illustrations are good, though the characters do tend to stick around a bit too long in their "dorm rooms" in the first half of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a perfect combination of the classic and the contemporary. It presents a fascinating and often surprising story about a very rare animal that is, in fact, completely extinct.  It is an interesting look into the history of an animal that no one has ever seen alive.   I had no idea that the extinct sea lions, which lived off the coast of North America, were so poorly understood.  The authors really shine in the writing.  You get a good sense of the history and development of their society and how, once, this society would have survived as it did for many centuries.  This is the first book I have ever bought that contained both the classic animal and the current day animal. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating look at the evolution of language as we know it, from the first sound made in proto-Europe to the complex, multisyllabic structures found in English and other European languages today.    It also has an eye for the quirky and surprising; the occasional oddball word (including "bacon")  seems to be a sign of a "deeper understanding of how the brain works."
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good, well researched book on the history of sex, and how it has changed in the last few centuries. It's definitely more than a simple history text; it offers up many useful, sometimes surprising observations. I've already incorporated many of them into my own research and writing about sex. I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating and erudite exploration of how one of the most misunderstood religious ideas of our day is being misunderstood by much of the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of this book. The characters were well developed, believable and interesting, and I loved that some of them were written like children, and others like adults. I also loved that the characters were not all perfect, and sometimes even got into fights. I am also a fan of the humor in this book, and it is pretty funny as well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I read this book, I had several ideas I would have loved to see developed in another work of literature, but did not, as I said, find them in this one.  It was certainly interesting, though, and provided much food for thought.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had heard of the book, but had not gotten around to reading it. It was a treat for me to get a chance to.  The book has some very interesting insights into how we perceive and interpret images in our own life.  It is important to realize that images have different meanings to us.  I thought the author's explanations for this are very logical and helpful.  Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the psychology behind images and our sense of reality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book, but it's not so good that it's worth buying for the Kindle version alone. There are just too many typos. The plot was so weak that I kept reading hoping that it would turn out to be a good thing. I got so sick of it after only a few chapters. The author is clearly a good writer but her poor spelling and writing style makes this a lousy read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was a sophomore in high school, and I loved it! This book was my go-to college textbook in college.   The content is very useful when taking classes like this one!

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's like watching the making of a cult movie: the young people in the movie have no idea what they are doing, but in the end it works out and the film gets released.   A lot of the stuff that takes place in this book is very similar to what takes place on the screen: "The only thing I know is that God is a woman. He is wearing a dress. She gives me chocolate."   In the end, I am glad that I did. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an outstanding book that offers the reader an extensive and well-informed analysis of both history and science. A thorough, scholarly, well-argued, and compelling treatment of the key issues involved, with examples from both history (the "Scientific Revolution") and science (the development of chemistry and genetics), the book is a wonderful resource. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have found this book very enlightening. I have also learned a lot from her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading The Art of Fielding by Joe Posnanski. It was an enjoyable read, and very interesting. Posnovsky is a gifted writer, and the anecdotes he tells about his experiences as a professional baseball player are fascinating. I learned a lot from him about the game, including why managers who are willing to take risks for the greater good of the team are often unpopular in the clubhouse. If you are a baseball fan or just looking for a good read, I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished The Last Lecture... a book about Gandhi I first read in high school. The Last lecture was written by Dr. Peter Kuznick in 1972 and it is the only book I can think of in which Gandhi has been a major theme. The book is fascinating because Gandhi's life story includes the period during which he was a radical agitator and revolutionary. I read the biography as an adult and learned a lot about Gandhi from the book. I also think the subject matter of the book is good for some people. This book will be in my bookshelves for many years.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I received this book in exchange for a positive recommendation. It was a quick read, and I was able to catch up on a few of the characters and the setting. I enjoyed the book overall.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed reading this book. It was really interesting to me how people can have so many different reactions to the same things. In the beginning, it was hard to understand how someone could so quickly change their mind about something. I think if it were a good idea (or if the person was so in tune with their own feelings that they could make a change on their own), I wouldn't have changed my mind so quickly. But it was interesting to read this book about how people make such quick decisions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was a junior in high school. It was so compelling, and such an entertaining read, that I couldn't wait to re-read it.  The stories in this book are so rich and well-researched, that you can't help but relate to them.  It's a great read, even if you can only read about the things that interest you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a kid I was obsessed with Dr. Seuss's The Grinch, so I was really looking forward to this. The Grumpy Old Elf is my favorite of Dr. P's books. Dr. N and Mr. B have a very nice relationship, and are both very nice to each other. This makes them a good, easy-going team. They take care of business. The characters in Dr. B's books are very funny and they get to really mess up a couple times. The way Mr. P handles them is great, too. I really love the illustrations too.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book about the Holocaust I've read.  The author, R.J. Barnes, is well-informed and has the skills to convincingly portray the complex events of World War II.  I read a lot about the holocaust but this one was the best.  It's well researched and well-written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a way to explore different religions and religions' philosophies. In some ways, I found the book very interesting and in other ways, it was somewhat tiresome, though I did find it interesting. I think that this is what happened to me in this book: 1. I started it because I wanted to learn about Buddhism, which I hadn't done much before, and I found it interesting, although not particularly helpful. 2. In the middle of it, I started reading about some of the ideas behind it, and found some of those ideas to be irritating and annoying (I'd be interested to know more about the "four noble truths"). I think I've found a compromise in this way: I'll learn about the philosophies I enjoy, but then I'll pick and choose parts of it that I think are helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading this book.  Although I don't have children, I do know a couple who do.  And their children are now in school.  I have found the "tough love" approach at work with them is very effective.  They've not only turned their lives around, but they have been able to enjoy themselves.  It's nice to know that it doesn't always have to be a one-way street, but it certainly is.  This book reminds us that we're responsible for the lives we lead, even if those lives turn out to be rocky. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, Paul Krugman, an economics professor at M.I.T., tries to give the public a rational answer to why government policy, and thus the economy, is so awful. But I think it's better to give an answer to a question. And that question is: Why doesn't anybody want to give a rational explanation to policy  ? Paul Krugman is a brilliant economist; I'm amazed that he can't make himself more public-spirited. But what do I mean by that? Why isn't it easier for policy makers to make good choices, and why aren't voters more impressed by rational explanations? There are lots of ways to answer that question, and Krugman chooses the wrong one.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book's title is self-explanatory. It covers the background and events of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The author makes it clear that he is not interested in whether the Warren Commission's findings are correct, only in whether they fit the evidence. The chapters are well written and his sources are impeccable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that it was written more for young people than for adults. However, I think the book could be a good teaching tool for those who are concerned about sex. It's a very simple, yet powerful, story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of the book deals with the psychological mechanisms that affect people's ability to deal with problems and adversity. The second half deals with how people can use these mechanisms to their advantage in overcoming adversity.   It's very interesting, interesting even. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic work of fiction about a fictional character, a man I've known and loved for decades. When he first showed up as an adult, he was an alcoholic and a junkie. He went through a traumatic childhood of abandonment and neglect, and was always on the brink of suicide. The author explores how these experiences and other obstacles to self-determination shaped the man he eventually became, how he dealt with these events, and how his relationship with his father influenced his later decisions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was disappointed in this book. I was expecting something a little more upbeat and positive than a book about life and relationships.  Instead, I found something that was really dark and depressed.  I found myself feeling pretty sick after finishing it.  It didn't help that there was a lot of talking about death. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had a few years to get over reading this book, but I kept going back, and I'm glad I finally did.  While I had a hard time reading about the abuse of children in the church, in this case it was not just a case of poor leadership, but of child abuse.  The author's voice is compelling and her reporting is full of detail.  This book is a must read for anyone who has a concern about children in church. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so happy I bought this book.  It is a very informative book on the history of the early church. It also goes into the history behind why the modern church is the way it is. I am a former Mormon who has struggled with the truth claims of the church. I have even written a book on Mormon history that has never sold well because the church denies it's own history.   But I did finally accept that the church is not true.  Even more disturbing is that my local LDS bishop is still supporting the church and even teaches Sunday School.  I just don't believe that the gospel of Jesus Christ will change his mind about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is full of good information about the various techniques for teaching children to read. The first four chapters show the practical steps, like the way to arrange paper books, how to move from one book to another, how children with dyslexia can read, and the importance of developing a vocabulary. I especially liked the part about learning vocabulary with the use of pictures. I remember being very excited about learning to read, but not being able to read even in the few months I spent learning to do so. I'm very glad that I learned to read with this book."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete and scholarly work about the 19th century ever written. It is full of information that, while not in every respect original, is nonetheless highly authoritative and useful. It presents the period in a way that both gives you the lay of the land and gives you some idea of the people involved. I recommend it highly for anyone interested in the American Civil War and the Civil War itself.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book well enough that I plan to reread it in the near future.   If you have never played with Lego, you should try. It's a blast. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not only a valuable introduction to one of the world's most influential religions but also a useful guide for those engaged in research into any subject.  The author has done a lot of work in the field of comparative religion and gives many examples of how people have applied the teachings of Islam to their lives.   The book is a little dense in places, but is ultimately very interesting and engaging.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My first book, "Eating the Planet," about the environmental impact of eating meat, was very well received by my readers.   It was also a very good read:  For one thing, the author is clear and concise in explaining how we have created a very large problem that, if we are smart, can be solved very quickly.  He's also well aware that some of us, who don't like to eat meat, are going to get upset if he doesn't make that case.  While I would never agree that eating meat is essential, there is absolutely enough in the book that will have people reading more widely and thinking about how we might go about doing things better.  For example, he explains the very different health benefits from eating fish vs. meat.  The author is clearly on the side of "fish"  If you are concerned about what you are eating and are considering trying a vegetarian diet, "eating the planet" is an excellent place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful reminder of the importance of reading, of making time for books, and of how we need to give our children permission to be curious, to ask questions and to try new things.  There are so many wonderful books about girls and women in our culture, but this one is so original and so well written that it has become a new favorite, along with Mrs. Brown's Boys. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been trying to get more books on this subject on my shelves, but am always stymied by lack of interest. This one, with its wide array of subjects and detailed research, is a must for anyone interested in the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was initially going to wait until the sequel was published before I finished The Hunger Games, but when it came out I couldn't wait any longer, especially after the first chapter. It's hard to describe the feeling of being in the middle of something truly epic and epic in the end. The action sequences, the setting, and the characters are just so exciting, that you never feel like you're just watching someone else do something amazing, you're in the midst of it. It just makes you want to read more.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book. I have been trying to get myself into the habit of writing for a long time.  When I started, I felt very discouraged.  It seemed like it would be a long, difficult, tiring journey.  As it turns out, I found that writing is surprisingly easy, and there are endless ways to help you.  I recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a book that makes you feel like a winner. It is full of fun stories of people finding their passions and how they use those passions in their daily life. I particularly like how the author describes how many young people are so desperate for a job that they will work really, really hard for a long time for no money. It's amazing to hear people speak so honestly about their own lives and the reasons they work and sacrifice so much. It helps me to understand why I worked so hard on my computer screen for over a year.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I loved it. It's an interesting read about how different cultures use words and meanings differently, especially in the case of words like "motherfucker." I'd heard that the word motherfucker had its origins in the ancient Greeks' idea that the female sex is more animalistic and less civilized than the male, but that's not the only thing that makes it interesting. It also points out that when a culture finds a word it likes, it tends to keep it, and even use it in other contexts: "When the word "fuck" started appearing in American newspapers in the early 1960s, it started appearing with other forms of profanity, as well. But the most common usage of fuck was as an expression of disgust: a "fucking fuck" or "fuck fuck." As it turned out, "motherfuckers" was a common phrase in a lot of newspapers of the period."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a newbie to the field of evolutionary psychology and this book is an excellent introduction.  It's not just a quick read but a good one.  I found myself not only interested but also very engaged in the discussion.  There are so many interesting anecdotes from different individuals that it's hard to believe that people are still debating the existence of such behaviors. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed the last one. I enjoyed all the characters. I found all of them engaging and likeable. I really enjoyed the history lesson. I enjoyed that it was a historical fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the best one I've read since the classicÂ  The Great Gatsby  .   I've had it a while and it's been getting better and better as I finish it.  I love the prose.  A lot of the material in this book seems to come from real-life examples, so it's easy to see how it has gotten so much of its wisdom.  There are a couple of funny stories that make you laugh out loud, and there's a good lesson about how to be a responsible partner in the relationship as well as how to stay on top of things and not take life for granted.  If I had to sum it up in one phrase, it would be "Don't be a good man, be a better man." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is well-written and makes a strong case for the importance of early intervention in children's lives. As a mental health professional, I feel as though this book is an essential addition to the literature. I plan to review all the other books in the next few months.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading this book since I was in my twenties. I still remember when I was 18 reading it as a companion to a "how-to" book on how to make money and get more of it.  When I read the book, it really made me think of the way I thought about money and how that changed over the course of my life.  It was a profound realization.  I was so much more interested in my money at the time that I was reading the book than I was after.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book. I enjoyed every page. I think my son also enjoyed it as he has read quite a few books.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book.  I have a huge book collection, and I was very pleased with this one, which came in handy for many of the titles I had to look up.  The writing is clean, the illustrations crisp and clear, and the research detailed. I was also happy to learn that the authors had an interesting connection with the historical "Grimoires" and the books themselves.  A fun book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good book. I have a PhD in physics, and I have had some success writing about physics, so this one is a welcome addition to the world of physics 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the type of book I wish I could have read as a student. There were so many references and examples that I couldn't put them all in a notebook.  There were also many very interesting nuggets of information.  The book concludes with a summary and bibliography, and the book is very well indexed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been looking for a good SF novel for a long time now. I finally decided to pick this one up and I'm glad I did. This is a great read.   It's well written with an enjoyable cast of characters and a realistic portrayal of our world and its problems.  It uses all the tropes and techniques of great SF novels such as Time Travel, Alternate Universes, etc. and takes them and runs with them.  This one is fun to read and has a good story as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book so I can relate to the people in it.  I grew up in the 90s with this show and was a huge fan until the fourth season where the writers went all over the place.  Now, I'm too old to really appreciate these type of shows, but I know I enjoyed it enough to give it another chance. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Mapping The Mind" series has a nice balance of science and psychology. It's very clear why certain things happen in certain ways, and why certain actions don't. It makes you think about all your experiences, from your childhood all the way to the present, and it also helps you put a positive spin on certain events. The fact that this is also written in the form of a book (rather than the usual form of memoir or personal essays) makes it even better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It was very well-written, and I'm glad I bought it. The author did an excellent job of explaining the difference between "gut feelings" and "hard data," and I appreciated the variety of views the authors have on the issue. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book on the subject of "theory and practice in the history of science."  It gives an excellent, well-informed summary of the historical development of theory and practice.  It is clear that the development of the science of medicine over the past four hundred years has depended on a variety of intellectual, ideological, and social factors.  This book has many good aspects, including a thorough and sensitive treatment of the evolution of medicine as a science.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is a must-read book for anyone who wishes to learn more about the Catholic Church's teaching on birth control and abortion. Dr. Denniston is one of the best and most respected authorities in the field of modern Catholicism." -Fr. Anthony M. Paone, Notre Dame, IL I was pleasantly surprised when I found this book.  The Church and the New Age is filled with fascinating information on birth-control and abortion:  In the Catholic church, the Church teaches that birth control is permitted for a few reasons. 1) Birth control is sometimes necessary to ensure that all members of a couple are able to be a good fit for each other, 2) Birth Control is also sometimes necessary for the well-being of the mother, 3) Birth-control is also necessary for religious reasons, and 4) Birth Controllers are required to live chastely. In addition, the Catholic view is that birth-controllers who live as chaste as possible are helping the common good. The book also has information about a little-known issue involving birth control in the Church:  When the Church disapproves of birth control, she often makes a point of stating that it is never used to prevent a conception. In the first century C.E., for example, the Roman Catholic Church did not condemn birth control either, because the Church had little knowledge of how birth control works at that time. In modern times, however, more information has become available. When this information is used by the Church, it seems to condone contraception as an effective method of birth- control. In many cases, Church leaders, as well as lay persons, have admitted that birth controls have their place and that they have other uses. However, if the Church takes the position that birth restrictions, such as abortion, are always condemned, then one must ask the question:  Why is the Church condemning the use of birth controls that are effective at preventing a conception but not condemning the fact that birthcontrol methods sometimes result in the death of a person? 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of the book describes the early career of E. B. White and his various works, some of which have become classics of American literature (his best known novel, The Grapes of Wrath, is about a Depression-era farmer's family's attempts to survive the crisis of the 1930s). The second half of this book describes White's efforts to write "popular science fiction." In this regard, the book is interesting both for White's history as well as for the author's attempts at describing White's work in popular fiction. White's earlier work is much more interesting for its more realistic portrayal of life than White's later work. This book is about the efforts of a successful writer to find popular appeal in his writing. White was able to create a following in his early books while at the same time selling well at the bookstore because he was able (or perhaps was forced) to write well-written books in genres that were not typically accepted by the genre's traditional readers. By focusing on White's early work, The Book of Eibon does not seem quite as focused on White as other recent biographies. However, I can see why White would want to describe the success of his first two books in terms of "popular appeal." In the end, The Books of Eoban is about as close to the actual writing of White as you are likely to get in an academic text. Although The Books is not a biography per se, the description of White's career is excellent enough for it to make up for the lack of details in the text. The Book Of Eobon 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been waiting a long time to read this book, and finally got around to it.  I found the writing to be excellent.  It's so easy to relate to the experiences of those who struggled with addiction and were successful.  The writing style is very readable and has a pleasant rhythm.  Also, the subject matter is an extremely interesting one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been meaning to read this book for years, but I've never been that close to one.   It's not a bad book, it's just a different one, a little more accessible, but the writing and the presentation are so good that I found myself still wanting to keep turning the pages.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading (or re-reading) historical novels.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's been a while since I've been able to finish reading anything.   After I finished this book, I realized it had been sitting on my shelf for so long that I barely remember reading it.  It reads like a short story in which the author writes a few scenes and then takes a short break.  I would have liked to have seen the author work more on the plot.  The ending felt cheap and unnecessary.  Even after I finished reading the book, some of my most painful memories are from that section. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is filled with so much useful information it's unbelievable!  This is the kind of book you need to reference from time to time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm just now finishing The Last Lecture by Martin Luther King, Jr.  I've never heard him speak, but I like his writing style and I'm looking forward to re-reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is really good. It will not make you an atheist. But it will certainly make you think about what you do believe and the implications of that belief. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was surprised and delighted to find this book at a good price.   The book deals with some of the things people do to keep their heads up while they're suffering from chronic pain and other issues.  As a recovering chronic patient, I find this useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not so much about the story, as it is about the character. I read The Emperor of Ice and Fire from cover to cover, but I never got into it. I'm not even sure I liked any of the characters, although one of them I'm sure I did get into. I think that was the case with my experience with the first four books of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice & Fire series. However, after reading this book, I really do think that's the case. I liked the character development, the back story of each of the main characters, and the characters themselves. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A quick read for people who don't know much about a given subject.  It's easy to follow, and the book is fairly easy to understand.  A good primer on the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book!  A lot of authors write about their time in jail.  But this is one of the few that actually goes into depth about the experiences and emotions of being incarcerated.  This is an excellent book, especially for students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As I was reading this book, I thought about what the author had said in an earlier interview:  We have created a culture in which it is easy to be cynical, or even downright mean.  As a result, we have a culture that encourages people to be mean to other people. We have also created a "suck it up" attitude that encourages those who feel down to be disrespectful toward those who are in more than just a little bad mood.  It's as though there is a negative feedback loop between us and those we see as being worse off than ourselves.  We are in this culture, I think, because the culture is in our favor.  But what we need to do, I suspect, is to make our culture more positive.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book on the subject I've seen so far that is based on the current state of knowledge about the Holocaust.  It is a book that is comprehensive and accurate in the details.  This book will go a long way in helping to understand the Holocaust for future generations.  I have to be careful in my reading to avoid getting sidetracked by one particular fact and to only use this fact as a way of criticizing other books for ignoring certain issues.  For example, when the author states that in 1944 the Nazis had a large number of people who were to be sent to the Treblinka death camp for "cleansing" but were instead murdered there, I found it quite odd that these people were only to be killed once they had finished their work, rather than kept as slave labor.  The author also states that the camp commanders at Treblina were not only responsible for sending the people there for "purification" but that they were also responsible for their deaths.  They were not supposed to die, and indeed some of the people at Trebledina survived, but most were killed.  These statements are very telling.  But when I read that at Treblesin, not everyone was murdered, the author's statement on this fact is a bit of a disappointment.  Perhaps the book is misleading in this respect.   But the facts still remain that the Nazis executed some Treblesins who were supposed to be kept there.  At the time that these prisoners were taken to Treblesinf, the camp had not yet begun using the electric chair.  So the fact that the prisoners survived, rather then being executed, is not a big revelation.  And I will leave this review with a quote by the author of this book, about why Treblesint was a good place to be deported to:  (I'm) not a fan of Treblinsint, but it was a place that, in all fairness, did make good use of the prisoners who arrived there. It did not, on the other hand, make good uses of the inmates who were sent there.... Â  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book itself was great, but I wanted to read it on my own.  This book is very good, but is more focused on other people's lives and personal struggles, with only a limited focus on the author's own. I found this to be a very good book, but one that is best read with a group of people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book I found myself agreeing with every word written. The only thing I wish I'd had a chance to clarify was one thing that got mentioned in passing in a previous review: a certain character seemed to be the "exemplar" of a certain kind of feminist philosophy, a certain type of humanist and moral philosopher that I was not at all interested in. I suppose this is the "womanly" woman of the novel, whose voice comes out in the dialogue and whose philosophy is put into practice. I never did find her terribly convincing, and at one point I was thinking that she may not be a real humanist at all but merely someone who tries to be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're going to go the book route, and you're a fan of Jane Austen, Jane Austeni    might be a good start.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've listened to many of George R. R. Martin's books, and the first few were great. But now the last one, A Dance With Dragons, was my favorite of the series. It is the most emotionally affecting of all the books and the most realistic. I loved that it took place after the TV show, and that all the characters, even Daenerys, have been through some form of hell and returned. It was especially good to see the dragons - some of the most fantastical creatures in all of fiction - finally come back to the world of Westeros and have to adjust to normal life. I also enjoyed that there was no happy ending, and all the surviving characters faced the final judgment. But it was really the last book of the trilogy that sealed the deal on me. I have already started working on my next Martin book and I can't wait to hear the first draft. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little skeptical at first when I saw "Bible Nation: How America's Bible Belt Is Revolutionizing Christianity and Remaking America." But I have to say that the book is well-researched and thorough.  I think it will prove to be an important reference point for those who are interested in how the Bible is influencing the culture.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   If I could give this book any more than five stars, I would.  I started it during a particularly bad time in my life, when I felt like a fraud and was angry at every other person I came into contact with.  The book really helped me realize I had made mistakes, and that I should get back to being happy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in March 2015 after reading the other  The End of Faith  series.  I was a skeptic at the time and even when I finished this, I was still skeptical.   The only reason I finished was because I was enjoying the other books so much.  Although the book didn't persuade me, I'm grateful for the time I spent with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an amazing blend of historical research and great, timely commentary on modern-day America.  It combines fascinating historical background with engaging, relevant and contemporary commentary about American society.  There is nothing in the book that has not been said in a hundred different books.  This is the best single work on the American political system and history to appear in the last five years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of great information, but is difficult to read and comprehend. I understand that the author is a very accomplished and knowledgeable historian, and the book is well-written. However, I found the chapters in which the author describes some of the most important, but little-known, events in World War II particularly difficult to follow. The author does a good job of highlighting the contributions of women to the war effort in the Pacific, but fails to include the female role as a whole. This book would have been better as a more comprehensive reference work on the role of women during World War 2.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely love this book. I can't believe I waited so long to get it (I've been wanting to read it for years). I can already tell I will love it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am re-reading the works of the great poet and short story writer John Ashbery, and one of the things that makes him so unique is his ability to take any subject matter and make it funny.  While reading his early, very funny collection of stories, ''A New Name for Your New Friend,'' I couldn't stop laughing at one of his stories about an actor who is told to stay away from one particular area because it is ''too Jewish.'' As I've mentioned before, Ashbery is a very gifted short story artist and I think it's his ability, as an American Jewish man, to find humor in so many different contexts, as well as his ability (perhaps a little too much) to make the Jews in his stories seem like actual people, which he does in many ways, that gives his humor such a powerful quality. I've also found that, when it comes to humor, Ashberry has a tendency to just go for it, to have all his ideas and ideas of what a good joke is or isn't, run amok.   If you don't like it, it's your fault.  It's not like I was doing anything bad by laughing, or even that I enjoyed the book.  That said, I'm looking forward to reading more of his work.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read this book a number of times and always find myself wanting to give it another chance.   The prose is beautiful and the ideas are interesting and well thought out.  I don't know how else to say it but,  the story was great  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book and recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the complexities of how the US Government can behave so irresponsibly and the unintended consequences of doing so. It's also very entertaining. I've only read one other book that dealt with these issues, and I've read quite a few that discuss a similar subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was an excellent book about a young man in the nineteenth century who became an early leader of the American abolitionist movement. It is the first autobiography of an American that has survived to the present, and a powerful example of the courage and tenacity that was the common thread through most of the movement.  In the 1850s, John Brown made a bold and tragic choice to try to free his fellow slaves. Although his actions had disastrous consequences for both himself and the other slaves he managed to liberate, his courage and fortitude enabled him to lead a band of runaway slaves to safety. Despite Brown's tragic end, this remarkable autobiography demonstrates that even when you have the potential to make terrible decisions, you can still make good choices in the face of overwhelming odds, and that the choice to not take your life into your own hands is never easy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an invaluable resource for those with autism who want to make and keep a life for themselves. The main point is to accept yourself, to trust yourself. The author gives many examples of successful adults from different cultures who were able to overcome autism, and she does it in a way that makes me want to be like them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In addition to the beautiful photos and excellent descriptions, there is another great part about this book.  It's a brief overview of the history of the United States and its current form.  The author notes that the Constitution was designed as a compromise between the "Old" American system (i.e., monarchy, monarchy), which relied on force, and the "New" American Republic (i,e., republicanism, which relied upon self-government, i.e. democracy), which was based on the principles of individual rights.  According to the author, the founders of the Constitution, Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton, believed in the "natural rights" of man, including individual self-ownership (property rights) as well as the rights to life, liberty, and property.  They were inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution and of the American revolutionaries.  In other words, the Founding Fathers were staunch advocates of liberty.  As an American who believes in the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, I was extremely pleased to learn that the founders believed in freedom and the rule of law. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been interested in the history of the United States and America as a country ever since reading the first edition of The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.   The third edition of this book is the most recent work that is of interest to me.  A new edition adds more detail, and the authors have written about certain events in the American Revolution and the Civil War more extensively.  There are still some historical nuggets I haven't discovered yet (and can't wait to), but this is my best chance to have a fuller understanding of the events leading up to the American Civil War. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books I have ever read on the subject of the Christian faith.  It is filled with the type of personal testimonies and stories that are so important in helping one become a more confident Christian.  The author is quite a bit older, which is always a plus, and she takes the time to give us a thorough explanation of her reasoning in writing this book, especially as it relates to her own family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read "A Tale of Two Cities" last year and it changed my life. I had never read anything by Dickens but I had heard about him and I wanted to see more of him. This was a good choice. The book is not perfect. It is often wordy and slow. There are some passages that seem unnecessary. But it's good enough for me to read several times. I also had trouble with the spelling. This is the only book I've ever had a problem with.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a graduate student and am working on an advanced dissertation on American and British literature. I read this book while researching.  I enjoyed it immensely.  For those interested in reading an interesting, academic and highly readable work, this is a must read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This was a good introduction to the genre, which I enjoyed greatly.    The prose was good, but the stories lacked imagination.  I also found the stories to have less depth than some of the more recent releases in the genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always been interested in science and technology, so this was a good choice for me.  I enjoyed the scientific explanation of some of the more difficult things that I don't understand, but also found myself smiling at many funny stories that were related in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very readable book with a fascinating and well researched historical perspective of American race relations.  Highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book.  It is not just the "facts" of the subject matter that are useful, but how they are applied to the situation at hand.  This book helps us understand a very complicated subject and to understand why it has so often been misunderstood.   It also helps us to see our own actions and mistakes in the light of the situation.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's good to know that we live in a world that is far from perfect, where the good is often the enemy of the good.  The best part of the book is the fact that it is not concerned with political ideology, but is instead concerned with personal issues: the way we choose to handle problems, how we deal with stress and illness, and even how we handle failure.  As a personal issue, I think it's pretty straightforward:  You are never the good guy in the end.  You need to realize that there is something fundamentally wrong with your way of thinking, and then figure out a better way to think. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book about the Great Depression I've read. I've been a professor and a librarian for nearly 40 years, and this book makes the case for how important it is to understand the causes of the Great Crash of 1929.   It doesn't do this well in the introduction, which tries to provide historical context without fully explaining the crisis, but it's an important part of the story.  It also provides a number of solutions to the crisis.  The book concludes with a chapter on the role of the federal government and the New Deal.  This is probably the most important chapter in the book, and I found it especially helpful in understanding why FDR's intervention was so important. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book very much!  The description sounds like a bad version of The Hobbit, with a lot more Dwarves and Elves and more magic and swords.   That's not so bad, actually.  The book is more or less about one group of people in a village.  But, it's not a bad village!  A group of three young people, a woman, a young boy and a girl, go from farm to farm to town to sell things they have collected, all the while surviving by a mix of luck and guile and good manners.  They do all of this without knowing the language, and without the benefit of a car, but with help from a local blacksmith.  It's a good story, and it's entertaining.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was thoroughly entertained and educated by this book. It was good reading, good writing, and presented well. I have an extensive knowledge of the military, and I appreciate the author's explanation and documentation of various aspects of the Military.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book on the history of the U.S. military and the reasons why it is so important today. In this regard, it is a must read for anyone concerned with the future of our national security. It should be required reading for all those involved in national security planning. It is filled with well-researched information that should be familiar to anyone involved in security policy or decision-making today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a short and beautiful book about a young woman in the late nineteenth century, named Mary, who had a profound effect on the life of an ordinary young man, named William. I found the book fascinating, but somewhat dry and not particularly engaging. I also found it rather repetitive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very excited to read this book.  I've been working on an essay about my religious conversion, which I wrote some time ago.  It will be my first attempt at publishing something in a professional literary magazine, and I'm very pleased with the way my editor, Kate Phelan, has done a good job of editing my draft and editing the manuscript.  This is a wonderfully written book, and, for me, a much better introduction to a very important subject than anything I have read before.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've listened to all of the Maudlin editions of "The Children's Book of the Dead" (there are two) and am always delighted with the quality of the story and the illustrations.  This one is a great addition to the line. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is extremely well written. I was so glad to find it while searching for a good history book on the Civil War that didn't have an axe to grind. The narrative is very accurate in depicting the events that led up to the war. I did find that the section on slavery is a bit too sympathetic to slavery and not enough critical to the issues of slavery as a system. This is my first book and I am pleased to say it's excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, William S. Burroughs describes a dream that he had as a child: a strange man and woman appeared to him, telling him to go into the woods and hide.  When he woke up, he found that he was wearing a strange suit and was walking into a strange house.  The woman he saw was the same woman he'd dreamed of.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so surprised when I picked up this book that I bought it on the spot! Not only does it cover a lot of ground, it is beautifully written.  The author takes the time to examine many different aspects of the field.  Many of the subjects covered are quite difficult to write about but the writer does a very good job of presenting a very clear and coherent story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished this book after a long wait.   It is a fantastic summary of the science and history of HIV and AIDS, and it's about as concise as you can get.  It's written in a very professional manner, which is always welcome. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book tremendously. This was my first introduction to Jungian and Buddhist theory and it was both enlightening and fun. I enjoyed Jung's philosophy about the nature of reality and how it's not what you think it is, but what it is. And the Buddhist idea that what we think of as real is actually not so real. Jung believed that we perceive reality, but we can only perceive the shadows of reality because that's all we can really see.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second book in the series   is very much a sequel to this one.   It is also good, but not quite so entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is brilliant, even better than I had imagined.  As I said in my review of "The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable," this book is one of the best non-fiction I've read in a long time.  The style is engaging, the information well-researched, and the anecdotes well-chosen.  I'm glad to have found this book and am looking forward to reading other titles from its authors. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. It had been a long time since I had read a good fiction book, and I have not been disappointed with any of my recent purchases. It is funny, well written, and has plenty of good characters. The last two hundred pages were a great cliffhanger which made for a great ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a Christian myself, I have been in the process of being an atheist and trying to learn more about the world from the Catholic side. I have recently been reading the works of Christopher Hitchens and he made me realize that Jesus was more important to the modern world than the Pope, the Catholic Church, and the Jewish people. I was not impressed by the Bible as a whole. The only place I found great importance in it was in the Book of Matthew, but that was it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the only work of philosophy I have ever read that is actually a good one  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very impressed with this book, and I am definitely planning to purchase it.  This book has some excellent advice on what to do in a situation where you are caught between a rock and a hard place: how not to get caught.  I'm sure that I am going to become a better driver in the next 10 years, and this book will certainly help me make this happen.  In addition, my wife is a great listener, and she's been helping me get the most out of my car.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am now a big fan of this book, which is not to say I hated the first. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I wasn't a big bookish fan of it either. I think the difference between the books is that the first one is full of information about people living in a fantasy world that is entirely believable. The second one, on the other hand, is basically a collection of stories written by the author's friends about his time in college.  The characters are all in that place, where they are supposed to be, doing things that are completely outlandish and unrealistic. It's hard to get into that place and remain interesting, as it's all based on personal experience.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this brilliant book by Richard Dawkins (as well as Richard Lewontin) the importance of genetics is emphasized as the primary driver of evolution. The main issue is whether evolution by natural selection is just a biological phenomenon and does not have anything to do with intelligent design, and is therefore not a scientific fact. This book is very timely, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the importance and value of scientific thought.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a lot about Christianity in recent years, but I've been struggling to understand why some people are still attracted to it.  This is an excellent book that explains a lot in a succinct way.  I don't know who or what "Christians" are, but a Christian to me is someone who believes Jesus is the only way to heaven.  These guys are definitely not Christian, but they are still able to find their way through the Christian religion.  It's good to see that it's possible to find some common ground even if we don't understand each other." -- The Catholic Review
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. I don't think I've ever read a better book on the psychology of women. The writing style is simple and clear-headed. The author makes the point that women's sexuality isn't just sexual and that they have a lot more to give than just sex. The discussion about the negative side of being a mother is well written. The women are realistic and relatable. It took me a while to realize that I was a lot like one of the women in the book, except for the part where I thought that I'd never become pregnant. I wasn't about to give up my career to be a stay-at-home mom when I had the potential to be the first in my family to become a parent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed  the book  This book  is well researched, entertaining, and educational.  It  was a great way to keep up with the latest studies about the importance of getting adequate sleep.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been thinking a lot about how to respond to my friend's recent article on the history of American slavery.  It's well-researched, and I do have a problem with his depiction of black men asÂ  dehumanized Â andÂ  primitive   (he uses the term " savage " for a "slave").   In response to the argument,   "The whole point of slavery was to subjugate black men to white men's sexuality and thus bring about a change in the white race," I thought: Â No, it's not the point.  No, it is not even the best part of the piece.  If slavery were about the subjugation of black women, or of black people in general, it would not have lasted so long.  I will concede that white people were in control of the entire system, butÂ  I would think that black women would have been treated as second-class citizens, in the same way black people had been.  What the article  makes clear is that the men that white men owned were not treated so differently than the men they owned themselves.  But it's very important to remember that it was white people who controlled and owned the African-American bodies and minds and bodies, andÂ  what they found in that was a veryÂ  sexual and sadistic  Â thing.   And when that sort of thing is the reason the entire idea of slavery is worth the trouble, and the people enslaved are just objects of sex and violence,Â  there is no way to explain that away.  There is nothing in this to justify slavery.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a lot of fiction and read this one twice, first time was the hardest and the second time was my favorite. A couple of my favorite lines are the one about how her mom doesn't "get" it, and how she's getting ready for her college acceptance interview.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's about the power of writing good novels, but more so about how hard it is to write good novels.   For those who are interested in the subject:  One of the things that I love about John Brunner's novel The Last Picture Show is how much he emphasizes the role that the writing itself can play in shaping the emotions and experiences that you have while reading it.  His main characters, Sam and Edward, are both famous movie stars, and they are quite good at their jobs -- especially Edward, who seems to get what he wants by dint of his talent.  Sam and Ed are in the midst of a divorce, and both are struggling with the fact that they don't feel loved or valued by their spouses.  It is very rare for a divorce to be so emotionally taxing that it actually affects one of the spouses negatively. Â  Yet even Edward seems to be at a low point, and Sam is constantly questioning his own self-worth.  Edward eventually has a falling out with Sam, who is more devoted to his work than his wife.  When Edward sees that Sam's career is going nowhere, he decides that it is time for him to leave the movie business.  He then decides to do it the way he wants to.  At first, he thinks about just going it alone, but he changes his mind when he sees how successful Sam's movies are. Â  Edward eventually accepts that he has to leave Sam behind, and he eventually makes his way to Los Angeles, hoping that there is another opportunity out there that he hasn't thought of yet. Â  The rest of the book details Edward's journey to Los Angels, where he meets Sam's former assistant and former co-star, Bob Dylan. Â  Although Edward doesn't seem to love the guy, Dylan gets the better of him in a way that Edward is just not capable of.  Dylan then convinces him to come back to Hollywood with him. Â  Once they are both on the set, Dylan and Edward realize that they have a lot in common -- they are a couple, they are good at what they do, and most importantly, they have each other.  So why wouldn't they try to work together on a movie together?  In the end, they work out a deal, and while working together, Edward realizes that what he really wanted from his life was to be a movie star like Sam and Bob.  Now, the novel is quite depressing in its subject matter
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very interested in reading this book. It's a very different view of the world, one that doesn't completely subscribe to the liberal narrative, which says we need to let people live as they want and live in the way they want to. There's a great deal of discussion on the need for education, the benefits of diversity, and the various consequences of each. I agree that we need more education. I also agree that diversity can be an asset. And, yes, I do believe we should live in a world that's more equal and just. This book shows that a more just world is not one that takes away individual choice but one that is, in fact, the result of a culture that values individualism. As a result of education, people learn to value their own lives and to value what they're capable of doing, and this can be a very good thing. It also results in a less demanding society that has a much higher rate of success for everyone involved.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had no idea that the author of this book could write in such a way as to be so witty, yet so true. He takes us on an emotional roller coaster of laughter, anger, embarrassment, fear, and confusion. I was laughing aloud in the second half of the book when a certain character was making a comment about her new car: "It's very practical, but I've never even seen a motorcycle before, so I can't really comment on that."    The final section of the novel is particularly touching, and really captures the feelings of loss that many people feel when they lose a loved one, especially when the loss occurs suddenly and unexpectedly:  One of the best parts of the ending is that the narrator, whose life is about as happy as you could imagine, finally feels that he has finally reached some kind of peace with his loss, and that he can finally start to enjoy his new life and move on with his life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book that I have been meaning to get to the end of for a while. This book provides a nice summary of the basic historical principles that are so important to the way we think about our world today.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was totally skeptical of this book when I was first told about it. I knew nothing about the story it was based on, only what I had heard about it from other children's authors, who have all failed miserably in trying to capture the essence of the book. But I decided to give it a try. The book was really good, in my opinion. I liked the voice of the boy, whose experiences are well told and who is very close to the "real" story of the orphaned boy. The narrator is very good as well. She makes a few mistakes, but I forgave them. I didn't get what was going on in the orphanage and why the boy was put there in the first place, but that didn't really bother me. I loved the ending. I was disappointed that the narrator didn't mention the name of the man who found the boy. However, I don't think that's such a big deal, since the story is more important than the name that is given to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so good that it's almost a miracle that it existed.   It's the first time I've seen a work by an actual scholar published on the topic of black culture (although not always on the same subject, which is fine).  I've always been interested in black literature, but it's usually been relegated to what's on the syllabus in black studies, so to see a work written about a particular sub-culture is rare, even more so if it is a work that's actually worth reading.  The book has a couple of weaknesses, but the strengths are huge.  First, it has the most thorough discussion I've ever seen of how the media and popular culture have played a role in shaping what it means to be black.  Second, the book is well written and easy to follow.  It includes extensive quotations from black intellectuals, many of whom are not well known.  Third, it contains a wealth of information on how blacks and blacks living in the white community have changed the way they interact, but have kept some aspects of their own culture.  In a lot of ways, the difference between a black and a black in America is more about attitudes and values than it is about race, which I think is a fascinating discussion.  Even though the book was published in the 1960s, it's not dated and I think it's the most relevant book on the subject that I've found.  I also highly recommend the book to anyone who's ever wondered about black culture.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought the idea of the book was well-made and would be useful for many people, especially those who have been interested in martial arts for years but have been intimidated. The book includes exercises to improve your own posture, improve your flexibility, and develop the muscles needed to hold and strike effectively. I found the exercises interesting and challenging. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, if you want to read it, is worth the effort: it gives us insight into an ancient religion, the religion of which is called "the True Way" by the followers, and which teaches us that our desires, even when fulfilled, are still unsatisfying. The book starts with an excerpt from the Tao Te Ching, a book that I haven't read in a long time because I don't like to get into other people's opinions, but it was worth getting it from the library, because this book has some interesting insights into the book that inspired the book in the first place. The author gives the reader the idea that the True Way is very hard to follow, but he's very helpful by showing how to pick it up and use it effectively to bring you closer to your goals. This book is a must-have for any aspiring Taoist or Buddhist who wants to do their religion justice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a fan of the work of Mark Z. Danielewski for a while now.  In this book, he presents a compelling story of the history of the occult, which is fascinating in itself, but more importantly is an excellent introduction to how one can use this knowledge for positive purposes.  I was very interested in the story of George Washington's use of the Kabbalah to communicate with God.  Even if you're not a religious person, there is something very interesting to take from this story.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "When I read the first page, I was reminded of a friend who, while I was in college, had just finished reading the final pages of her favorite novel, The Sun Also Rises. A week later, I discovered she had died. It is the ending of the novel that I remembered the most--the last pages--and also the best ending: that the world was saved by a single person. I'm grateful that The Handmaid's Tale was written and that it has the courage and determination to show that the best days of American freedom are still yet to come."
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a wonderful book by an author that was an expert on the subject matter. The topic of race is very much alive and well in the United States. Many of the authors were on the front lines of the civil rights movement, and many are still involved. As an historian who has been very critical of the way our nation has handled racial matters, this book is a must read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had a lot of bad books. But this one was actually quite good. It's funny, clever, and smart. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has some very good ideas. For instance, the idea of creating an intellectual tradition that is consistent and self-correcting. As a teacher of American history, I think this is essential for the understanding of the United States.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful exploration of the subject of the origin of the word 'cannabis.' It is a thoroughly researched, well-written, well written and thoroughly enjoyable read. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the subject matter and a passion for history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished the second book in a trilogy on the Roman Empire by Ian Hancock.  Ian is one of those rare writers who writes in a compelling and well-researched manner.  As a result, I've learned more about the empire and its history than I ever could have hoped for when I began reading the series.  The books cover the rise of Roman power in the East and the rise and fall of many of the major empires of the ancient world.  These books have a good flow and structure and are easy to follow.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn about the emperor Septimius Severus and his son, the emperor Justinian, during their rule.  Also, I learned about the Romans' fascination with the "beautiful country of the Phoenicians" in the 2nd century BC.  In addition, I was fascinated by the Romans efforts to preserve their cultural heritage, including their use of mosaic tiles in the Forum.  Hancock's writing style is very smooth and professional, but he also incorporates lots of humor, which adds to the enjoyment of reading the books.  All in all, these books have been very informative and enriching. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a well-written, thoughtful and well-researched book on American history and politics.  While the author is not a political scientist, he takes his subject seriously and writes with intelligence, wit and a good sense of humor. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book, but the main character was an annoying dolt from the first sentence: "The book begins with an introduction by Professor Chomsky. This man, it turns out, is an American academic and intellectual. The rest of the book is devoted to him."   This narrator didn't even bother to mention the title of the other book and gave the impression that she only read the first chapter.  It's so annoying because I don't buy that she knew the other one existed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author, John Stoltenberg, tells the story of a group of young people who take on a dangerous job. In their search for a safe place to build a shelter, they're arrested, tried, and sentenced. The details of their trial are fascinating, but in the end they're forced to plead guilty. As they make their way back to their home, they meet up with an old friend and learn that their friend has a problem.   This is one of the best and most original books I've read in a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the few that I've read that deals with mental illness, even though the subject is often overlooked.  The main character is a woman who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Her symptoms, which include anxiety, paranoia, and depression, don't seem to be well-understood or understood by those around her.  She is a very strong character.  It doesn't necessarily make the book the best, but I believe this book would be helpful to any person who has suffered from a serious mental disorder.  I found it extremely useful in learning more about her symptoms.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "An extraordinarily thorough, thought-provoking, and readable survey of the history of the American Indian (primarily Plains) experience from the earliest times to present. If it had been written by a historian of American Indian history (as well as the author of American Slavery), it would have earned four stars from me."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about two years ago and I'm still having trouble understanding it.  I was so excited about it because it was the first book on the topic I'd ever read.  It was so easy to understand, and I thought I was going to love it. So, after reading this book, I'm sad to say I still don't understand it. I'm sure some people will be able to understand it just fine, but I'm not one of them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have found myself reading this book again and again since reading it in high school.  The story is compelling and the characters are realistic and believable.  It is not a historical novel or a story about the American Revolution (although, that is an important part of the story), it is instead a true story of a very personal experience with the disease.  I am still having nightmares about the events described.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book as much as I loved the novel. I love the way the characters interact, the way they use their imaginations, and the way their lives are impacted by having different interests and abilities. It's hard to describe the appeal of this book in one word, but it's definitely fantasy and magic. I'm looking forward to the next one, in which the characters are all different races/species of elves. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so incredibly informative. The author provides an excellent foundation and then goes on to explore in great detail various facets of the subject.  I highly recommend this book for any student of the occult, especially the Kabbalah and Kabbalist sects of Judaism, as well as those who wish to delve deeper into the teachings of these masters.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm trying to be a writer when I get older, and I think I'll write my first book now.   It's a young-adult fantasy, but that doesn't mean that it isn't sophisticated. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am reading all of these wonderful biographies by female writers at once. I'm a bit slow at reading and finding new writers, but these biographies are outstanding.  I feel like all of them capture a unique and compelling aspect of women's lives.  For women in particular, their choices often are fraught with peril. I can't wait to get through all the books.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very interested in this book after having heard that it is part of a trilogy. My anticipation for the book grew until I finally found it in a local bookstore.    Although the writing was pretty good, it didn't really excite me or get me excited about the characters. The trilogy itself, though, is a huge disappointment. I know it's supposed to be a story of discovery, but as a writer, I can't help but think that they chose an inappropriate book to tell this story in. The other characters aren't very interesting. Even the hero, the warrior-trader, is pretty flat. It just seems like they were trying to write about something other than what they actually knew and experienced. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently purchased "Lies My Teacher Told Me"   A few weeks ago I was in an elementary class, and a friend of mine came over for a visit.  We talked about a book she had recently read that was a bestseller,  When He Cheats,  which is about a young girl who goes from bad to worse.  After reading it, she said that I should read this too,  and I thought "why not?"  When I started reading it I was confused.  The beginning seemed confusing,  but it was clear to me that the author was attempting to explain her thoughts about lying,  by relating examples.  It was a good start.  I was also puzzled by the last section, about the things you can do to get away with lying.  Was the author referring to drugs and alcohol?  It seemed strange that such things are not included in the book,  But after a few pages, I realized that there was some truth to the story, and it made sense.   For instance, if I am caught in a lie,  there are several ways to get around it.  But, I might also take money from my boss and tell him the truth.  Another way to do it is to go and say that I am ill.  Of course, I would get fired if that story ever came out,  The point is that if I told the truth, I did not have to give him money, and if I gave him money he would not have me fired.  You get the picture.  In the end, the book is a great read, and makes you question the morals of your friends, if they are not honest.  For example, it is hard to believe that a good friend would tell a lie for your own good.  A friend will be happy to help you when it is no problem.  And you want to be friends with someone who cares.  To me, this book is an excellent read,  I enjoyed it very much. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It was easy to read, and was extremely well written. The theme is interesting, the book contains good illustrations, and the illustrations are well drawn. I would recommend this book for any serious history buff!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can't quite figure out the appeal of this one.  It has a lot of good ideas about modern day America.  But it reads a little bit like the writing of a student.  There are a lot that read like they were written by a person who just finished up a college education.  I'll have to read more of this to see if it turns out to be a worthwhile read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A little boy goes on an adventure with a dinosaur to rescue his parents from a cave-in and discover a secret underground world in this adventure book that is the reason I read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book gives a comprehensive account of the creation and development of modern science in the nineteenth century, as well as its impact upon the understanding of history and society. It is an impressive collection of essays from leading scientists such as Copernicus, Galton, and Darwin. This book deserves to be included in any library on the history of science. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a lot of favorite books, and when I started to read this one I was immediately drawn in.  I really enjoyed the stories and the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book.  I found it interesting to see how different people can react to different circumstances.  It was nice to hear about a different perspective.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book for any student of comparative religion.  It is well written, concise, and accessible.  This book has been widely used in schools, and is recommended by many.  The author's approach is very practical.  I am grateful for having found it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. It is written by a veteran of the military and military intelligence. It covers a wide range of topics, with the military being the central topic. The military, especially the Special Forces, has an extensive history in America's foreign policy, and the authors have taken a critical look at many of the practices of the Special Operations groups. They focus on various aspects of the intelligence community in the US - CIA, NSA, FBI, National Reconnaissance Office, etc. - and are careful not to fall into the common pitfalls that many authors do by taking these groups for granted. There are numerous examples in this book of the failure of this "conventional wisdom". For example, in explaining the use of the Phoenix program to deal with the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, the authors discuss how the Phoenix leaders failed to realize the fact that the Vietcong were highly organized, intelligent, ruthless and could not be pacified by the simple military methods that the Phoenix organization was supposedly using. They also discuss how Vietnam was an island with a large population, and how it was not wise to try and handle the problems of a small island by waging war on a large island population. Finally, the book goes into the problems that the Special Operatons face when trying to deal in a "political" manner with the civilian populations they are supposed to be working with. The authors' focus on the Vietminh is also a nice reminder that even if we all had better information, we may end up getting something wrong. I found the book interesting and informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed reading this book! I am an avid collector of science fiction and fantasy literature and this one really caught my eye.  It is well written, entertaining, and the author takes all the aspects of SF and puts them all together into a cohesive whole.  I love this book because I've been struggling with the idea of having multiple identities.  The author describes the experience and how it is hard to live with two different identities but I am in the process of figuring it out.   If you are struggling with this issue or trying to make sense of your identity issues, I strongly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is well written and well researched. The authors' expertise is impressive, and they are clear that their own background is the important part of understanding our world and the evolution of ideas.  They have a good sense of humor, too, and their sense of fun helps you laugh at the same time as you learn something.  It is also an interesting historical look at how the idea of evolution has been misused in recent years.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazing book that was originally published in 1993 and reprinted in 2000.  It is one of the few history books that actually contains accurate information.   It includes accounts from soldiers and officers during the Spanish-American War, the Philippine-American war, the Revolutionary War, and the American Civil War.  A good book to read while sitting around and listening to the radio or watching TV.
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent book on the subject of the Bible. This is one of those books where you can put down the book and go back to it a dozen times, not because the facts are new or interesting, but because you find yourself so absorbed in the story of the Israelites that you forget to be a "boring" human being.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had my mind blown many times when reading this book. It's got it all, a strong message and compelling characters that really pull you into the story. There's also an excellent ending that really left me thinking (though I still didn't quite understand it, which was disappointing). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a really fun read. It was an enjoyable read as well as informative and useful.  I learned a lot about my own personal issues and that of my parents (who I have no contact with anymore).  It was a great way to spend a weekend.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is such a beautiful novel! I was so intrigued that I bought the book immediately after finishing it, but I kept waiting for it to be over and I finally read it over a month later. I had been very worried about how it would turn out but it's a very good read and I hope you keep writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in 2007 on a flight from NYC to the Midwest. It was a good way to prepare for a big exam and is a great reminder of how important the first few days are, especially if you don't know much.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very happy with this book, as it is one of the best that I have read on the psychology of religion.  It was my third book by Michael Horton, and I am grateful for his other two.  I particularly appreciated his discussion of religious ideas as a metaphor and a metaphor for life.  Horton's book is about a man with Down syndrome and a very strict mother (who is also his guardian angel).  As a result of this, he is very critical of organized religion, and his view of heaven is very much like the afterlife view of many religious people, which has been criticized as pseudoscience.  His mother has come to believe in the afterlife and the supernatural after having witnessed a miracle.  At first, her view does not seem to make much sense to her son.  She tells him that the miracle must be the result of the prayers of many who have gone before him.  But then, the boy begins to realize that the universe may be governed by some kind of natural laws, so that the actions of one individual can affect the whole.  He is encouraged to explore and question his religion. Â  Horton concludes that the supernatural is not necessarily incompatible with our sense of reality, since religion is based on the belief that the things that are seen are in some way real.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and thought that it would have been better had I read it in a more traditional manner.  I liked the book quite a bit because it was informative, but not overly academic.  That said, I'm glad that I read a good academic text because I used to work in the humanities, and I thought the style was quite odd and unnecessary.  In the end, however, I still enjoyed the book a lot because I think that a good read is something that you should do for yourself, and not just because it's what the professors said to do.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such an amazing book about the history of the American South. The author, John H. Richardson, is a brilliant historian, and the book is filled with interesting details about various aspects of the early development of the South.  Richardson has a very good sense of humor.   He has fun drawing our attention to how silly things can sound like when you talk about them. For example, the author has an amazing memory for the various names of various Confederate generals. Some of them include: "Dakota," "Tobacco," "Sassafras," "Duck," "Cuckold," and "Hunk."   I think I even got a "Hump."  I laughed out loud and thought to myself that "Humpy" is a wonderful name for a horse.  It makes me think of "Humped" in the "Happy Days" song, "Hippity-Hops." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will take you on an adventure that will make you think. As a former high school teacher, it really made me think. I know I had to read a good high school book, but this one was better than I was expecting. It was a great lesson in how to learn a subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a very well written exploration of the complex psychology of human nature.   Dr. Jung's writings are full of fascinating facts about his personal and professional lives, and this book offers a more detailed account than I've ever encountered.  Dr Jung's own views of the self-destructive nature of modern life are discussed in detail, and his assessment of the current global situation, including the possibility of a new World War, is also quite interesting.  I especially enjoyed his discussion of how many people have lost their ability to see the best in people, to love, to trust, to be optimistic about the future, to accept a good gift when it's offered, etc.  It's clear to me that Dr. J is no fan of the world we live in today.  This is not to say that he's an optimist about the world or any particular individual, but he does make a case that this time is very different from any other time in our history.  If we are to live in a good way and avoid the kind of destructive pathologies that plagued our ancestors, we will have to relearn the power of inner peace, forgiveness, acceptance, and inner connection.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is one of those rare books that not only brings to the surface one's own experience of the world, but also, like a fine wine, transforms one's view of the very reality one is immersed in. In fact, one's perception of reality changes so dramatically in the course of this book, that it's as if reality has been inverted."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've just started reading The War of Art by David Kelley, and the book sounds great.  As soon as I finished it, I decided to buy the audiobook, and I was happy I did.  Kelley delivers the goods in spades.  He discusses the value of intellectual curiosity, and of being an open-minded consumer.  His observations about the way art and technology have both progressed and become more and more complex over the last few decades make for great reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must-have book for all college libraries. I have a few other titles on this list that I have loved and found very useful, but this one was a revelation to me. The material here was so interesting, so well-researched and written, that I just couldn't put it down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was an absolutely terrific book. I am a big fan of the Twilight series and this is my first attempt at reading it in paperback (although I've done a bit of online research). I love the vampire mythology (it is one of my favorite genres) and I love horror stories.  While I'm glad the author was willing to read her fan letters and get some of the things wrong, I enjoyed reading this book so much because it felt like a genuine attempt to explain vampire society.  It's a world that I really can't imagine going to without a book and it was cool to get my own take on it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's the type of book you want to be able to point to at a time in your life when it was really helpful.  There are some things that I remember reading in it, and other things I don't.  A book that is a collection of interesting quotes, but the quotations themselves were not very helpful, especially when it comes to "bad" behavior:  "The most dangerous thing in the world is to do what you think you should not do"  "If your goal is to be liked, don't do something you hate."    That's all pretty standard advice from any good motivational speaker, and is pretty much true in every field.   I wish the book was shorter because I would have enjoyed it more, but I'm happy with the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is written with a very serious tone and with a great deal of scientific precision. The book is an attempt to explain the physics behind quantum mechanics without making things complicated for the layman. It is an excellent source of information and is an essential book for anyone with an interest in this subject. If you don't understand the physics of light, you're going to have a bad time.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this is a good novel. It has some good ideas, but it's not an easy read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am always looking for interesting and well written fiction.  I found   in my favorite bookstore  The Penguin Group.  The story is funny and has a good plot and characters.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has a lot of good things that a lot more people should read, but its problems are so glaring that it has become more of a burden than a helpful reference. The book opens with an account of the American Revolution and the destruction it caused. Then it discusses the American Constitution, the Electoral College, and the Electoral Vote. Then the book dives right into the American political parties and their leaders. Then there is the subject of slavery and how the Republican Party helped create the institution. Then comes the subject to women's rights in the United States and what that has led to. There is much more to this book but at the end, the author is too pessimistic to be of much use. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is not really a book. It is a collection of essays. But, as you will see from the title and author, it is written as a series of interviews. This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in how we think and communicate. If you have never read a philosophy book, you should. It may not be the kind you enjoy the most, but it is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I'm ever feeling a little down, I can pull myself out of it with a few good reads. This is one of them.
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you can only have one book, this is the one 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book for the first time during my freshman year at university. My English teacher recommended it to me as an excellent introduction to the history of modern linguistics. It's interesting because it shows the influence of classical linguistics on modern languages. As a student of both language and history, this is particularly interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book. It's a good introduction to the field and provides useful advice for students.  The author is a good writer and has the information to back up her assertions.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of the war in Vietnam is so gripping that you begin to lose yourself in it. This book is an excellent companion to any serious student of history. It tells the story of that war as best it can be told, as if to a young child, but is able to draw much more meaning and impact out of the lessons it teaches than just about any other book I've read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in one sitting in June and was amazed at how thoroughly it was researched, and how convincingly it was written.   The story took me to new places and gave me new perspective on the Bible.  I also learned a lot about the world of the Bible's earliest writers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading The Death of Stalin. It is a good, informative and well-written book. I thought it was a bit of a slog at times because the author wanted to present an entirely objective look at Stalin's life and politics, which I do not believe is always possible. I liked the "theory" of his "permanent revolution", but I found that some of the statements made about Stalin's leadership were quite inaccurate, as is the case with most of what you read on the Internet. However, the book did not focus on Stalin's "evil" but his "good". I also appreciated the way the author treated Stalin's relations with his family, especially his wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. Her role in the struggle for power is not explained by Stalin himself, but was instead a result of their mutual love for each other. This was not an uncommon experience for many of those in power, but in the book it is not seen that way. This would be an excellent addition to anyone's library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is told with a lot of subtlety and detail, making it easy to get attached to characters as the story unfolds.  It's like when I first encountered a classic novel, and as I was enjoying it more and more, I began to think of all the other classics I'd read over the years that I still loved.  I'll certainly be seeking out more of her writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. It's got the same sense of wonder and exploration that made The Secret World  such a great game series for me. This book picks up some threads and adds some additional elements, but it doesn't completely rewrite the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I have read on psychology in the last 15 years.  The research in this book is very good and the book uses the same statistical approach used in psychology to evaluate the results of research.  I also appreciated the book's focus on women.   It seems that some people don't like women's opinions about relationships or are very sensitive to them and want to exclude them from the conversation.  However, these views are not supported by the research and should not be dismissed out of hand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very good book. It has a very unique approach to a very serious subject matter (the "evil empire" of Napoleon, and the impact of the war on France and Germany). The book is interesting because of the many details on the people and the times that are included, which are often interesting for their own sake (e.g. "How Napoleon's troops treated the French people," "How the French and German armies changed each other over the course of the conflict," "The extent to which the French army lost its moral drive," etc.). The book also is interesting as a historical study. While it is a great book about Napoleon's rise to power, it is also a very informative book about the Napoleonic Wars (i.e. the wars waged by Napoleon after his defeat in the Peninsula, where he lost his army in a hopeless battle against the French Third Army). I found the "history" side of the book to be quite interesting. The "sociology" side was a bit disappointing. It was somewhat repetitive and sometimes too technical for my taste. I was more interested in the personal side of Napoleon.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent read on the history of women's suffrage, and its aftermath, from the perspective of women who participated in it. The story is presented in an entertaining manner, the author engagingly providing background information about the events that occurred before, during and after the women's convention.   It is well written, especially considering that it is an "ex-history" book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed this book and read the others in the series. I feel that I am in tune with the characters now as well. I also learned a valuable lesson about the difference between right and wrong that would make a great lesson to the kids I teach. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the first 2 or 3 chapters to find out what was in the third and I thought it was pretty good. It's a little slow at times, but not bad. And I think it's got a lot to say about life in the United States, especially on the subject of racism.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I think it is a good place to start and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was written to help an adolescent who has been sexually abused. She is very brave for having gone through the process of talking about it openly and of reading about how other survivors handled the same. In doing so, she has gained a great deal of confidence in herself and other survivors. There is not much of a happy ending in this book but I can't help feeling that it helped her make peace with her past and she has learned from it. It would have been helpful if she had more experience talking about the abuse. It's possible that some of the details were not entirely factual (although she said she did have sex with the first man, he was only 18). I'm grateful for what she has to say. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read so many good historical fiction books in the past few years that I almost feel like I've been a bit spoiled by the genre, but this book is different in that it tells a believable, suspenseful story that takes its time to really reveal all the hidden secrets and characters.   The historical elements are excellent, from the time the original manuscript was written in 1598 to the time it was completed by the first American settlers, to the many events that occurred during the long, harsh winters.  The romance in the book is an added bonus for me, too, because it really helps to flesh out the characters and bring some much needed color to the already vivid and realistic characters. I particularly like the portrayal of the women. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this well-written book, Robert Bly proposes that humans could become as intelligent as intelligent computers. Bly uses several examples to support his argument that we have the capacity for this kind of "higher" intelligence. It makes for an interesting read. I'm not certain that the examples are entirely accurate, but it's hard to imagine how we could possibly become as smart as computers.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting book that I bought to read, but didn't quite make it through. It was so engrossing, however, that I ended up reading the whole thing. The writing was interesting enough, the historical background was interesting (how the Catholic Church came to accept evolution in its official teachings), and the argument was well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book by a gay man. It's about a gay teen who tries to have a happy gay life as a teenager and a gay woman who lives her life as her own and tries to be as happy and as free as a lesbian can be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have ever bought about this tragic but inspiring family. The book is packed with great information that is well written. I also like the author's explanation of how her father struggled to cope with his illness. I would also recommend reading about other families who suffered the same tragedy as my family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating and insightful book about the human psyche that takes us deep into the minds of three individuals at the edge of sanity. I would encourage anyone who is struggling with their mental health to pick this book up and start studying their own subconscious. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pretty shocked when I finished this book; I'd already given up on reading books about love and marriage and family because I just couldn't get my head around them in the past. But this one had a lot of heart, and I'm really glad I picked it up.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the most thorough book I've read on the history of the Jews. He brings to life the lives of Jews who lived in America before and during the early years of the republic. I have found his writing style to be as good as that of the people he interviewed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of The Road is a very compelling narrative. In it, we follow the adventures of a young farmer in England, called Jack, who comes to the U.S. as a young man and becomes an American citizen, becoming a naturalized American citizen of British descent, and ultimately becomes a lawyer and advocate for immigrant rights. We meet several of his family members, including his wife, his father, his two sisters, and his brother-in-law. The main thing that struck me about the book is that Jack's story reminds me a great deal of what I went through, the hardships and struggles that I overcame in the early stages of my American life. The second half of the book follows Jack's adventures in the U..S. after he becomes a citizen. I can't say that I'm very familiar with all the events in the book, but I'm sure that the book was written after the events Jack goes through, and as such, it is not all that far off.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was thoroughly entertained and inspired by the book, which takes us on a journey through the world of medieval music. I have always enjoyed historical fiction, but until now I had never read anything that was based on actual historical research. For all the academic rigor that the book employs, it is filled with the personal observations and humorous anecdotes that make it such a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been interested in the history of American women's education since I read The Gilded Age. This book is both a great historical read and a good social history of women in the 20th century. I loved the fact that it covered a lot of different aspects of women's history from different areas: politics to family life. It is very entertaining as well as informative and helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've enjoyed this book. I'm reading it as an undergraduate course and it's one of the best I've ever read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had this book a long time ago, and while it did not have the same kind of depth as "The Secret," it still contained a number of the same ideas and insights. The material was somewhat dated, as was the author's approach to the subject, but there was still a good dose of truth in there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best historical novels I've read. The author is an outstanding historian who makes her subjects fascinating, not simply to be gory and sad.   The plot is well drawn and the characters are well drawn.   I hope to read other books by her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic study guide in the area of early childhood development, with many examples and insights that can be applied to children as young as age two.  It is a must-have for everyone interested in child development, from preschool teachers and psychologists to parents and pediatricians. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful introduction to some of the fundamental principles of mathematical modeling. Although there are many examples in the book that are extremely difficult to model mathematically, these models are actually quite simple. The examples are usually "simple" because they require very few assumptions about the system being modeled. However, the key assumptions of these models can prove to be very difficult to solve and difficult to verify. This can be especially true if a system's "internal consistency" is crucial to its behavior, or if the system is extremely complex. For example, an example given in the introduction, "the probability that two coin flips will occur heads, heads, and tails, heads", can prove difficult to prove. To model this, you may need to "bias the coin to lie head" or "use a uniform distribution to model a discrete system". There are many more examples of difficult problems to be solved. Although the book is not explicitly geared to students or even mathematicians, the examples are extremely clear and engaging. This is especially helpful for someone who has taken a course or two on probability but is still struggling with modeling situations and proofs. Overall, the book provides a very clear introduction to the fundamentals of modeling and will have a substantial impact on both mathematicians and non-mathematicians.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book a few years ago and it helped me to understand some of the issues that were causing me grief and anger in the Mormon Church.   The author's insights and willingness to get to the bottom of the problems are very welcome.  The book is written very well, and it includes helpful appendices that include many examples of specific problems.  Although I'm disappointed not to have seen these earlier in the book, I'm glad that the author finally had the courage to admit that the problems weren't solved and that they were in fact causing more damage than good.  I look forward to reading more of the author's work.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Great American Scrapbook: A Collector's Handbook for the New Millennium" by Susan D. Kohn is a great resource for any American scrapbooker. I've been collecting since 1987, which has brought me to thousands of books that I am excited to find a home for and enjoy. Susan D.'s book is so very detailed and comprehensive that I feel it really should be required reading for every scrapbook collector. The photographs are amazing and the text is easy to understand and complete.  I've already begun to put my scrapbooking materials in Kohn's book and will be purchasing additional copies as I finish them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If there is such a thing as a perfect book about religion, I would put The Case for God in the top tier. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not just about religion, it's about life. The author doesn't just discuss religion, but about a wide range of different topics that make up the bulk of our existence. She has a lot of fun, and gives a ton of good information on what we learn from different sources. I loved the discussion of what it means to be human, how we can make meaning of the time we have, and how our emotions affect our ability to relate to others. I especially appreciated the chapter about the difference between the personal and the universal. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In my mind, the story is set in two cities (Detroit and Chicago) in two different eras (the 1950s and 1960s). There is one protagonist and one story. The story is about a boy who finds a note that someone is taking his childhood friend away from him. The narrator makes this a metaphor for the boy's mother and his loneliness and inability to connect.   This story is a beautiful description of loneliness. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful book! It's a historical work that examines the evolution of American women's roles from the seventeenth century on and its influence on the way women in the United States today live. This is especially the case with respect to women's reproductive and domestic choices. There is so much discussion on the topic that a full treatment is a major undertaking. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is wonderful. It is extremely clear, informative, and, above all, entertaining. I learned a lot about myself and the world through it. I was blown away by how well-researched and accurate this book was. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a real impact on me. It's one of those rare, insightful, and powerful books that really opens your eyes to a different view of a world you thought you knew. If you're not used to reading about politics, this book is like an instant-classic -- a quick, fun, and effective primer on how to get your own ideas out of your head, and on to the public stage.  I am not a fan of the American right, and I don't always agree with their policies and methods, but this book made it clear to me that they are very much in the minority.  You need to think critically about your beliefs to make sure that your political positions aren't driven by ideology.  This was a book I picked up quickly to give it to my friends and to use as a reference when they needed a little help understanding where I come from.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent, up to date book on the history of the US-backed Afghan resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1979. It is a must for all serious readers of US foreign policy.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been looking for a good YA book to read for ages and this is the one I've been looking forward to.  There are some parts that don't quite mesh with each other perfectly but the story is really great and is a nice change from the books I've read so far.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the definitive history of the National Socialist movement in Germany from the 1920s to the early 1970s.... As the title indicates, the author is a historian who studies Hitler, the Nazis, and Nazi Germany. The first part of this book covers Hitler's youth and teenage years, when he participated in Hitler's paramilitary youth group, the Sturmabteilung (Storm Troopers). The second part covers his political rise in early 1920s Germany..... The third part of the book focuses on the rise of Nazism in Germany, especially during the 1930s. This part was written before the publication of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich..
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first book I read about "the Jewish problem." It was a refreshing, if somewhat controversial, read. The book makes a powerful case for Jewish self-determination and empowerment. But it also makes a strong argument that the only Jewish state is one that exists within the democratic United States. That argument is an attractive one, but it should be clear that in reality a Jewish state cannot be self-governing if it remains outside of the US.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently started reading a book about my mother's life, and in the last chapter she relates the story of her meeting with her doctors after her death: When my mother was very ill, she was taken to the University of Chicago hospital in Chicago. The nurses were in a hurry. They were all working and she was not going to make it. They asked the nurse to go in and examine her. She said, "But mother, I'm not going anywhere. I'll wait here." And so she sat down at the bedside and waited until the doctors left. "She looked so peaceful, so peaceful," she said. "When she looked like that, I knew she was going to be all right." I don't know why she was so calm; maybe because she knew she wasn't going to die soon. My mother's spirit and courage were remarkable, even in her last illness. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. It contains many insights into how to run a successful business. I can relate to so many things in this book: the importance of having a good work ethic, taking charge of your own destiny, not giving up when things get tough, and so on. I will be recommending this book to anyone who asks about the value of hard work.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A brilliant historical account of the rise of the Christian faith. The author covers a wide spectrum of subjects from early Christianity to the modern day, while also exploring contemporary developments. Her focus is always on the human side of the story, and she always provides compelling arguments for her conclusions.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book and I know that I'll have a good time reading it again when the time is right.   It contains many interesting facts about the history of the United States, and the events and people that shaped the country.  It is divided into two parts, "Our History" and "The Present"   The first part is about events that occurred from 1790 to the present, and provides interesting facts of what people did when they had power, and what they did when it came to running their own countries.  The second part looks at events that took place after the first part, and is a great book for the end of summer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was excellent and the book has been used as a "teachable" tool by other teachers.  There were many parts that were informative, and it was fun and interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a brilliant and thorough investigation of the relationship between the modern "sexual revolution" and sexual dysfunction. It is one of the most important books I have ever read on the topic. It has been sorely neglected in its time. I'm a woman in my 30s who was sexually abused as a child. I have struggled with sexual compulsions, which in my case are sexual addiction. I became an atheist in my late 20s, which made me question all of the sexual "myths." After reading this book, I've come to realize that the myths are a huge part of the problem. The author describes many of the psychological problems associated with being a sexual addict, including depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and self-harm. She also gives a clear description of a typical sexual addiction (an addiction to sex without feeling emotionally connected to someone else) and describes the types of people who do it (including celebrities who have gone on to make millions of dollars while being completely detached from their sexuality). I learned so much about myself, and I have made major changes in my life. It's well worth the time and money. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was an enjoyable read. I enjoyed all of the various characters. I particularly liked the two women, who are almost opposites. The first is a tough, old street Â woman who doesn't know much about relationships, while the second is a smart young woman who has a good head on her shoulders. The two characters are the same age and both seem to have a lot of life in them. I liked their interaction so much, I almost wished that they lived together. I like to read about older women as they have more wisdom, and I liked how the story was written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've heard this book before. It has been recommended many times as a great "How-To" book. I have listened to it and then, when it came out as an audiobook, I thought "why the heck should I bother listening to another book when I already have this one?"   The answers are not so much "simple", but are really simple.  Simple is better than complex.  A couple of sentences that I love:" If you want something that you don't have, do without."  If you have one or more of the following, you may be happy.  If so, you donÂ´t have to do what other people are doing.  To take an analogy from my life, if you have the same shoe for every shoe type, and you want to wear the exact same shoe every day, you will need to put a new pair of shoes on each day.  You will get tired of it after a while.   Simple solutions are sometimes better than complicated ones. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful for both teaching and reading.  While not perfect, it is a good place to start.   A wise old author once said that "no one can read all of one book, but they can read a lot of books" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book!   It has become a staple in my house, and it will be on the list every year I reread it!  It is a nice change of pace from the more traditional, "manual" books I'm usually forced to buy.  I like how you don't go over the book's actual rules for writing, but simply explain the practical tips and tricks that I use to improve my writing.   Thanks for a great book that helps me write better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good first book for a general audience.  The story is compelling and it follows the development of the characters.  I really liked how the character motivations for their choices are always presented in a believable way.  While the novel is certainly long, the writing style is easy to follow.   I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about the history of modern warfare.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a collection of short stories that explore a variety of characters, often with a very particular theme. Each story is told through the eyes of a different character and explores the different emotions and experiences they are having at the time.   I enjoyed reading them and enjoyed the different viewpoints.  The writing is very good and the characters are well developed.  I think I'll re-read all the stories at least once before I put it down.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a very good book, but unfortunately it's a bit out of print. I picked up a second-hand copy of it a few years ago, but it's been almost twenty years since I've been in a position to buy it.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are a lot of good books that cover the same topic, but never seem to have the same depth or insight. This one comes to the rescue.   The book covers a wide range of topics -- both practical and theoretical -- in an accessible, well-written style that's easy to follow.  The author describes the process of using the right tool for the job, so that anyone can pick up a book and be up and running on the right system.  I recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who need to find the right tools for the jobs that keep their organizations running. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. It is a good reminder of the need to be skeptical when someone tells you that your favorite book is "the best thing ever written about the Bible!" You can't just go to the Bible and "read it for yourself" and come away with the truth. You have to read it with an open mind and an open heart. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is perfect in its description of the Jewish practice of eating matzah.  In order to be recognized as a Jew in the world of the Sabbath, one must have a special, unique and separate matzoth. To obtain this matzoh, one can purchase or receive matzot from a mamzer (Jewish ritual collector), rabbi or rabbi's personal cook. The matzof itself is a special kind of flour that has been dried and milled to become a smooth, slightly crunchy biscuit. This matzuh is eaten for the sake of the Seder (Passover seder). The matzuah is cut into small pieces and eaten by the Sages (or the guests who are supposed to be eating the matzummah) to indicate their special status. This is an example of the uniqueness of the Torah in that all Jews share in the same special ritual, and the custom of eating the Matzuh has survived for more than two thousand years! "
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a well-written, highly accessible textbook on historical political writing.  It also includes many important and interesting interviews with scholars and writers from the early 20th century, including W. E. B. Du Bois, William Morris, and Robert Conquest, along with many of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read about a very personal and important subject: the importance of learning the history of one's country.  I have a great appreciation for the efforts of historians and authors who try to give readers an accurate view of the country and its people.  This book was such a success as it was an easy, engaging read.  A fun and enjoyable read that is also very informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.  It gave me a lot of good advice about how to think critically about a problem and to approach it from an unbiased perspective.  The book is divided into five parts:  Part One: The Facts  Â  The book begins with a good analysis of some of the problems we face in society.  But at the same time, it doesn't just dismiss these problems, it points out their commonality. Â  There are problems with the current monetary system, with the distribution of income and wealth, with unemployment, with inequality.  At the sameÂ  time  we have the problem of mental illness. We are more likely to go to the doctor when we are ill, but we are less likely to get the right treatment.  We use drugs, but more of them don't work.  A lot of the health problems we see in society today have origins in our culture. Â  These are the problems I wish people would think about more when they are confronted with problems.  And the book makes the point that a problem is a useful tool.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an important book about one of the best literary mysteries ever written.  Its a mystery about the death of the Marquis de Sade (or rather, the death and resurrection of an evil alter ego).  There is an eerie, haunting beauty to the book, as the author explores the character of Marquis's most hated enemy, Sade's favorite mistress, and Marquis himself, whom Sade loved so much that he tried to poison him in order to spare him from Sade himself.   All of this is well-written, especially for a thriller that is so dense and detailed.  It is also very well researched and carefully put together.  The author's use of history, letters, and interviews with historical figures are all quite fascinating and well-researched.  In addition, the book is a very good illustration of what a detective book should be like, so it is a pleasure to see Marquis at work and in the process of unraveling the mystery.  This book is perfect for a rainy afternoon, so make sure to grab a copy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I finished reading this book several months ago. While I have a long way to go in order to be ready to read my first book by Ayn Rand, I am glad I got to read this book. It was well-written, entertaining, and informative. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in philosophy, economics, and the free market.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've loved reading The Art of Manliness since I first read it as a college sophomore. After a couple of years of studying and living, I started to realize that the author isn't a manly man. Not only is he not the manliest man around, he isn't the man of principle, either. This book is a scathing indictment of the manliness craze that is sweeping the nation and its culture. The man who is supposed to be the hero of the book is not the one that is presented as being the most masculine. Instead, he is the man who shows up late, who doesn't work hard at his job, who is lazy and selfish. He is the guy who just says whatever comes into his head (and I quote, "That was the way it was done when I was a kid.") The author is aghast that most men are taking this book and putting it on their bookshelf. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am reading this book right now and I just LOVE it. I have enjoyed many books on psychology and personality, but this one is different. The author has done a great job of weaving the author's own experiences with her patients and with her own theory of the personality. She covers so many aspects of the human experience, and we get such a nuanced view of the psyche. I can't wait to dive into the rest of the books in this series.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have loved the novel 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy. I'm a huge Cormac fan, I consider his work to be a masterpiece. This book, though, is a different kind of masterpiece.Â  The novel is a fast paced and suspenseful adventure story. The characters are complex, the plot is complex, and the story has suspenseful twists that make the reader feel like he or she is there, with them, on the edge of their seats. The ending of the novel is shocking, as the author writes: 'I am the villain of this story; the author of the book is also the villain, and we are all victims.' The ending is chilling, but I didn't feel cheated. I felt that the novel was told well enough that I was glad the author pulled this one off.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was at first skeptical of a book about a woman who suffers from mental illness, but the more I read, the more intrigued I became.   When I finished this book, I was shocked at how much I had learned about the subject and how much further I had to go.  I am convinced I was never as mentally ill as I thought.  My experience has been far different from the common stereotypes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book.  I have been reading the biographies of notable American leaders for over forty years, and have always been impressed by the depth of knowledge and experience they have acquired from long and varied occupations.  Here we have a woman who, in addition to being the first lady of Arkansas, also served as U.S. Secretary of Labor, U.N. ambassador and Secretary of Commerce under FDR, and as a member of the board of the Arkansas Education Association.  As a public figure, Mrs. Clinton brings a deep knowledge of the public policy debates of her day and has the insight to relate the results of her experiences. She was also a good student. I learned a great deal from this book. I will never forget her comments on the importance of government being able to function on the basis of the consent of the governed.  A truly fascinating book."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always thought that the only books that were worth reading were the ones by authors that you couldn't wait to get rid of.  A great idea, not very good execution. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In short, my favorite book is The God of Small Things.  The book is about a New York rabbi who is searching for God while struggling with his own faith.  He talks about his own search for God's meaning, the many ways God has answered his questions, and God's answers to other people's questions.  The God that he finds and experiences is not a religious God but one of generosity, humility, and forgiveness. The God he finds is different from the God that others believe in but is not necessarily different from God the person. Â  He is a God who understands God's ways and is willing to give God's wisdom. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so thrilled to have found this book!  I have been struggling with my identity for a very long time, and had I been aware of this problem earlier, I might have been able to better cope with it. The book has helped me to see that there is a good part of my personality that is "dark", and that's okay.  My mother told me about a book that said that "darkness doesn't have to be dark".  That inspired me to read it immediately after finishing the book, and I was very surprised at how well it related to my own life.  It is a very uplifting book, so I encourage anyone who is struggling with this, or who is just thinking about it for the first time, to buy it immediately! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, which was published in 2010, is a fantastic historical account of the American Civil Rights Movement.  Although I was initially disappointed that it was written as a "biography" rather than a "sociological" treatise, I have come to appreciate its thoroughness and its historical accuracy.  It makes the reader aware of the important role that the NAACP played in the Civil Rights movement, and how crucial the NAACP was to organizing poor whites who were more likely to be victims of discrimination.  The author includes historical notes and an index, which makes it much easier to follow the author's narrative.  Also, the author emphasizes that the Civil War did not make racism a non-issue in the South, but rather that it allowed blacks to fight for their rights.  This is a good reminder for those who want to think about the Civil war in a historical context, and not as a moment when racism became an acceptable American practice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a very skeptic of "The Little Prince" when it was first published in French. In French, the book was called "Le Pigeon s'oublie," which I always thought was an insult. But the translation to English was excellent, so I read it on a plane with my daughter and we all had a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most complete and powerful work I have ever read on the subject of Jewish identity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have now read most of the books in this series by James Patterson, and I find them all to be excellent, from the very first to the last. Patterson, however, has taken my favorite character (the hot headed, rebellious, but ultimately good-hearted, but sometimes selfish, but always good natured, but still rebellious) and has turned her into a complete bitch.  Patterson's main characters are always very entertaining, but, from my perspective, Patterson has created the least interesting female protagonist in the whole series.  I understand that it is very difficult for women to write men as well as they can write themselves, but for a series about a boy who falls in love with a girl, you'd think she would have to be the most badass girl ever.  She doesn't even have a boyfriend!  And you wonder why girls don't write men like they can. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  It was full of life and humor and wisdom, and I'm so glad that I got to read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful. I really enjoyed it! My daughter is in second grade and I got the book for her for Christmas. She really enjoyed reading it. The book starts out a little rough, but then gets into the swing of things. It's a fun story about how the story of Noah is a very good lesson. She also enjoyed seeing how she and her sister are different. The pictures at the beginning of the book are also great. I'm glad I bought it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book and have loved it ever since. I have read many biographies of famous people and this book is a great example of what a good biography should be. The author is very careful about interviewing his subjects and his interviews are great. The style is easy to read and the interviews are extremely candid and the author is so nice in his descriptions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely love this book.  It's the kind of book that a student could read and not feel that they had to be a master to be able to understand it.  The explanations are concise and easy to understand.  There is an appreciation of the history of the American West that is always appreciated, and this book is full of historical information that will help to understand our nation's culture.  In addition, there is information about how people think about the West and the issues that are important to us today.  I am certain that there are many more people who are not familiar with the West who would enjoy this book as well.  This book will be on my reading list for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has been the most useful thing I have read.   The best part of it all is that the information is presented so logically.  The author discusses the causes of the great depression of the 1920's, the reasons why those caused the depression, the causes that led to the financial crisis of the early 1980's, why the economy is recovering now, and many other topics.  A well written book that you can get through in a week. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about 4 years ago but have never re-read it.  It was so well-written and thought-provoking that I wanted to re-buy it right away.  I really liked the book because of how I relate to its premise: the idea that if we do not live as if we were invincible, we will be vulnerable and that we will eventually lose our edge.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much. It gives the reader a great look at the inner workings of the American Psychiatric Association. It also provides an alternative viewpoint to the "normalcy bias" prevalent in most mental health treatments and the medical establishment. It is written in a clear, easy to read, and interesting style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It tells the story of a young, queer boy named Ryan and his relationship with his gay best friend, who is also his age. The book is written in first person from Ryan's point of view, so Ryan is the narrator, but the story is told in third person by the friend, which makes it a lot more personal. This story is written so well, it makes you want to read the book and see how the story ends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am glad that this book is now out in the world. I found this book so interesting that I read it twice. I think it is more accessible and understandable to an undergraduate than most graduate textbooks. I am not an academic or graduate student, but I found myself reading this book several times over. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book helpful when I was trying to understand a more complex aspect of how a human is able to perceive the world and make decisions in the context of their own experiences. I've had many experiences with people with developmental disabilities and/or mental illness. They can be very good and thoughtful people, but they often don't grasp the importance of what they see and what they experience. My grandmother had multiple brain surgeries when she was a child. She spent her entire adult life in a state of "miserable vegetative state" as she called it. However, she was an incredible person. I don't know if the experience helped her become a neurosurgeon, but it certainly gave her perspective on life that most adults can only dream of.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only reason this book is in print is because it was recently reprinted. I purchased it two years ago and it is wonderful. The style is quite different from the more scholarly or academic books I am familiar with. But I enjoyed reading it so much that I am purchasing all of the reprints. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book several times now and I enjoy it each time.  I think that the book is well written, well researched, and easy to read.  The title is a bit misleading, because there are several different kinds of spirituality.  However, there is one universal aspect that links all the various traditions, which I think makes it a worthy and interesting read for those who are interested in spirituality. That aspect is what we might call 'The Power of the Vibe' 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a must-read for any serious reader of the works of science fiction and fantasy, and anyone who loves to read and enjoy great books in general.   This is one of those rare books that transcends genre.  If you love classic fantasy and SF you will love this.  It includes all the classic elements and also takes some very surprising turns.  I found myself wondering, "What if in these other worlds, the hero's quest is to find a lost child, not some lost technology?"  I enjoyed the exploration of this idea throughout.  At the end, the boy comes home, and the hero discovers the technology was never lost at all.  That's the great joy of good literature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found the whole story intriguing and even inspirational. I have a lot of time on my hands, so I was looking for something quick and easy for when I get a day off. This book is perfect!   The stories are short, punchy, and just the right amount of confusing so that a new reader will be able to follow along without losing their place.  It's all presented in a really fun way, so it's easy to forget that the stories are not entirely fictional.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can't recommend this book highly enough.  It is a must-read for every Christian who is thinking about becoming a non-believer.  The author's personal journey is a compelling story, and she writes from a position of strength.  Her strength is a joy to read about.  She is courageous enough to tell her story openly and honestly, while also remaining faithful to God's Word.  I know that many people find it difficult to believe that anyone could really live out their personal conversion story and remain a Christian, but I found it absolutely inspiring.  For this reason alone, this book is a true joy to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading this book. I read it several years ago on the recommendation of one of my graduate school professors. I enjoyed the book so much that I purchased it as soon as I could. The book is well written, well organized, and I think is quite interesting. I like how it covers several interesting topics that are not widely known. The first chapter is called "The American Dream," which is a good description of the American Dream today. In the first half of the book, you will learn about the evolution of the welfare state, the growth of corporations, and the role of government in American life. In particular, the book goes into the role that big businesses have had in government support in the name of the "public interest," which was created in the 1950s to give government support to big business in the midst of the Cold War. The second chapter is about the current economic downturn. In this chapter, you learn about some of the things that people are doing to survive the current recession. The next three chapters cover government programs to promote employment and economic growth, and how those programs have failed. In addition, the chapter goes into why you would be better off just not having to work. The last chapter is an interesting discussion of the state of the economy in the early 21st century. In terms of government support, you find that the amount of money that goes to welfare programs has risen to record highs, while corporate subsidies have fallen dramatically. Finally, there is an appendix with some of those "success stories" in the modern economy.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. As a Christian, I have a very difficult time reading the New Testament.  This book helped me out.  I especially liked the way that St. Peter dealt with the "fallen" angels and with the question of which of the three prophets actually prophesied the book of Revelation.  In addition, I found the chapters about "the Last Days" fascinating.  St. Francis de Sales wrote about how the church would have to face the fact that they were no longer "on top," and that they had to accept the "new order of things."  It was interesting to read a book written by a former Roman Catholic about how that church was approaching the present 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "A powerful reminder of what real heroes do.Â  If you want to live in a country, take the next train to Washington, DC."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book, and although I do not agree with some of its conclusions, I felt it to be an honest account of the political and social consequences of the Vietnam War. I enjoyed reading the author's analysis of the causes, consequences, and consequences of U.S. intervention in Vietnam, including her view that the U.K. was more culpable than the U to the war, and also of her account of how the U was caught off guard by the Soviet invasion and was unprepared to respond appropriately. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good story that touches on some of the issues that confront us as we come of age: maturity, faith, growing up.    It also touches on the difficulties of having two parents who are married to each other.  It's a nice read and a good way to learn some perspective from your parents.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I was just re-reading a couple books I had bought over twenty years ago but found so poorly written they weren't worth buying again. The author describes in great detail his trip to the South of France during World War II, the hardships he and his fellow Allied soldiers faced. It's a fascinating read, but the writing is quite shoddy. He mixes up and changes descriptions of things with no explanation, and he makes careless use of quotation marks. The same thing happens in the last third of the book, with more careless mistakes. His descriptions of the places he's visited are as well written as in any other book I've read about World War I, and while it would have been nice to have more detail about the war itself, this is probably a good compromise.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is probably the most important thing I've ever read. A writer on the verge of bankruptcy recounts the struggles of having an artist's eye.  It's an excellent book, but I think it will help a lot more people if it's put on a bookstand.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had been struggling with addiction for many years before realizing that a drug or alcohol was the problem. I read this book as an exercise, because it is so good at capturing so many of the key aspects of how addiction works.   It's such a good read that I have had the book for a couple of weeks now, and it is not so much about addiction as it is about the challenges involved in learning to live with a disease that you don't know you have.  The book has some of my favorite illustrations in a book: how the "rebound" that happens in addicts after detoxing from drugs or alcohol can leave them a different person.  In addition, this book includes a lot of information that can be used for addiction treatment, because I think that addiction is a disease, and that treatment can be designed to help people learn to live a better life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a solid historical account of a very important event, one that influenced the development of American law and policy for more than two centuries.  The book is organized chronologically with a thorough bibliography at the back, but there's no indication that this is done only for the benefit of the student.  Instead, it serves as a good introduction to a major historical event.  I found the account interesting and informative, although a few things raised my eyebrows.  It took me a couple of chapters to get used to the title "The Dred Scott Decision," but after I got there, I was pretty satisfied.  There are a lot of references to the decision in the books I've read that cover the subject, but I found them less convincing than the book itself.  On the other hand, it was refreshing to get a book that was so frank about how this decision impacted the American legal system, even though I felt it was a little too quick on the draw.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really good. It goes over all the ways in which people make bad decisions, how they get into trouble, and how they can avoid it.  For example:  Someone is thinking about buying a new car. They walk into the dealership. The salesperson explains the features of the car. The salesman shows the salesman how to use the car and shows the man how to get the key.  But the salesman doesn't mention the other important features. He doesn't tell the man that there are many bad things that can happen when you put a gas cap on the car's tail pipe.  The salesman doesn t say that when the gas cap is on the gas tank, the car becomes dangerous to anyone who breathes the fumes.  And then the salesman leaves the salesman alone, because he knows the salesman isn't going to let this stop him from buying the car, but he lets the salesman know that the salesman has a reputation for being very good at what he does.  Another example: A young man gets into a car accident and has to have his hip replaced. The man decides not to go to the hospital for his hip, because the insurance will probably cover it. But the insurance does not cover hip replacements. It only covers spinal surgeries. So the man is sitting in the hospital, and he is having a horrible time because he cannot move his hip. He is thinking, "How can they be so stupid?" The insurance agent who is checking on him in the waiting room tells him, "Well, they have to pay the hospital bill, but it will cost you a lot less in the long run if they take you to a spine specialist first." This is really important advice. It can save you lots of money. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  The stories really hit home in a way that books can never do.  I've always been a little skeptical about the health benefits of coconut oil (or any oil for that matter), but this book really showed me why.  It shows how coconut oil is an effective treatment for everything from acne to high cholesterol.  You also learn that the fats in the coconut oil have a special, antioxidant function that allows the body to absorb many essential nutrients better than the same nutrients obtained from any other source.  That alone made the book worth reading!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is brilliant, and a must-read for every serious feminist who considers herself a feminist.  There are a lot of good things in this book that are often overshadowed by the book's many errors.  For example, I think that it is extremely important that feminists be honest about their own privilege and why they benefit from the system we live under (as opposed to saying, "I am not racist, butâ¦" which is the same thing in a different language).  This is an important book for those who do not have the luxury of having friends who accept their privilege for what it is.  It is also very good for those of us who are white and male, and who are often accused of being the root of all evil because we are white, straight, and male.  I also liked the section on why it is very important for white women to understand that they need not apologize for what they do, but rather just be more careful in their language and actions.  This also applies to any privileged person.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the book so much that I bought it to read while driving home from a long, tedious business trip.  I knew that I needed to stop writing, but just getting it down felt like such a relief.  This book is written in a fun, informative and sometimes silly way.  It will get you up and going and will encourage you to keep writing.   It's also hilarious. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. There were many good lessons for the author, myself included, but one that stood out was the importance of the time and place a person lives. The author says the importance is that the time in which you live determines how you think, the way you look at the world, the relationships that form, and the path you take in life. The book also offers examples of people from different times who have been influenced by different times. I am glad this book has been updated so that people can learn more about the importance and the beauty of different times of their lives. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title, The Secret World of Alex Haley, is too long to be taken literally; it was an attempt to create a fictional world that looked like it might be real but was in fact made up, or at least, very loosely based on real-life events. Haley's characters had a real and varied range of personalities, and Haley's prose style was so easy to read and so easy on the imagination that it gave the novel a sense of realism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of this author. She is such a nice person.  Her stories are funny and heartwarming, and the characters are well-drawn.  I have recommended this book to many people and it makes them laugh out loud. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book which shows why you should never be afraid to go against the grain in politics.  One of the main authors is a very good friend who has known Reagan and both are very good friends of mine.   I'm glad he had this book with him when he worked on Reagan's campaign.  He is an incredibly brave and eloquent man who knows he's right.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much.  It's not so much about the subject in itself as it is about the personal growth that comes with learning the art of language.  I had not learned a foreign language until I was 21 (I'm 23 now).  I felt that this book was a good way for me to go about learning another. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The way the authors explain the creation of nature is truly remarkable. It takes the author a bit to get there, but she eventually hits the nail on the head in what I've seen others miss. I am not an ecologist (although I do enjoy reading about them, so if you are, you'll find here much to relate to) but I have always thought that the way in which the authors relate this subject is fascinating and enlightening. I love the way they describe the formation of the ocean and of other elements, as if they were real. It's quite something that in some ways is a "realism" in that nature is not always a dream but rather a living thing. I like to think that nature has a way of creating itself from chaos or disorder, as opposed to the more orderly and orderly forces of the human mind or of the universe. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a comprehensive overview of the history of the LDS Church and Mormon culture. It is by far the most thorough and up-to-date book I have read on the topic.   The subject matter is fascinating, the information is accurate, and the conclusions are sound.  If you are looking for the definitive, authoritative, and complete reference work on this subject, I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book a lot.  The plot kept me intrigued and entertained, but the characters also had the potential to be more than I expected.  In fact, I had so many questions about their backgrounds, motivations, and relationship that I almost felt that I should have asked the authors.  I hope that I can enjoy their next book, as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been waiting for a copy of this book for about a year and a half. After looking through numerous books, magazines, and websites, I found only one that met the criteria: a practical, up-to-date, and relevant book for home, classroom, and church use. And this is it.   It has everything: information, pictures, exercises, and more.  And it's only $20!   Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much. It's not a perfect read -- the protagonist is too much of a ditsy bimbo for my taste, and there's no shortage of stereotypical women in the book. I think, though, that it's a book that would probably be enjoyed by a lot of different people.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My second choice for any library, but this is the one I recommend.  It's full of memorable quotes and stories that will stick with me.  In particular, the one about the last day of a trip to the Grand Canyon is a classic.  The book is a wonderful companion to any time I spend outside my comfort zone, and there's something about the images of a river at dusk that just hits home. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book.   It's easy to read, doesn't have any technicalities that would drag down the reading experience, and it's got some great examples of effective teaching.  It also makes sense to me why so many teachers are struggling to get their students to take writing more seriously.  The book is filled with ideas about how to teach writing and how to do it in a meaningful and meaningful way that makes students pay attention.  I'm glad I picked it up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a long time "reader" of the wonderful works of Mary Shelley, as well as a fan of all her other novels. The short story collection "Lovers and Friends" is, for me, one of the most important collections of stories ever published. The writing in it is beautiful, as is the way Shelley shows off her incredible skill of telling the stories and then ending them as if they're just beginning. In fact, I think I could read "Lover's and Friends," one of her short stories, over and over again for weeks on end. She is truly a master of the craft. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Dylan is a book about the most famous and influential musical figure in the twentieth century. He writes from both sides of the record, the side of the public, the one who is fascinated and the side who is disgusted by the man. Dylan's own views of himself, his music, and his contribution to popular culture are as varied as his own music and his own public image. There are moments in this book when Dylan's music is as relevant as ever and his public image is as strong as ever. There other times, however, Dylan feels like an old-fashioned pop star, a person who needs to be rescued. He says he is trying to put an end to the commercialism of popular music and has been given too many chances by the press, the music business, and a world that isn't quite ready for him. Dylan is so consumed with his work that he has a hard time finding time to take pleasure in the things he cares about most. His friendships are also complicated by the public image he's built over the years, which has also given him an albatross." -Publisher's Weekly
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" and I absolutely love it! I was never a tidier person in my youth and my house was littered with unorganized junk, but I started making a conscious effort to clean up a few years ago. Since then, my home is filled with neat and organized objects and I am amazed at how much I have been able to clean off my house without doing much more than taking out the trash once in awhile. I now own two houses and both have been tidied up. I have a few tricks that I've learned that are especially effective, and these will definitely make a difference on your own home. If you have a house that needs a good cleaning, you just might be interested in purchasing this book. You won't regret it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading this book for years. It has been through many editions, and many editions in that they have been corrected. This time, it is an excellent revision. It includes a short section on how to write a successful biography, and is very helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a really interesting read about the history of early America, particularly in the North and West.  It gave me the sense of where I live and what it is like, and was a fun read to boot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found The Last Book of Zora so interesting and well-written that it was a joy to read. It's a fascinating look into the life and times of the famous author, and even offers some insight into the creative process.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book, and will likely seek it out in future. The concept of what can and cannot be accomplished by technology is interesting, and the stories are engaging. If you enjoy science fiction, then you should definitely pick this one up.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a wonderful book. It's well written, easy to understand, and is the perfect book to give your child to read. It also has a very good message.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little apprehensive about reading this book, given that I had heard so many stories about how people use drugs and how they are a waste of time. But I really enjoyed this book and I learned some interesting things about the drug use in the early American colonies. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little skeptical of this book, but it was worth the wait. It gives a really good overview of the history and evolution of the concept of equality, and is well written. I think it would make an excellent high school text, and I'm already looking for a copy for my own book collection.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not a huge fan of books on economics. I've read several, but they just aren't very well written.  I was looking for something a bit more technical for a short study, and this is it. It is not as mathematical as textbooks, but that's not really a bad thing.  In addition, the discussion on how different countries operate, especially in the context of the current economic crisis, is helpful.  Highly recommended.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a brilliant exploration of the many ways that modernity and Christianity are interconnected. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It's very useful to get a deeper view of religion and culture, and it's really refreshing to see Christians who are critical and thoughtful rather than preachy or condescending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was an absolute treasure. I was blown away by all the insights and stories within.  In addition to being an interesting read, this book offers a clear and useful framework for the development of new skills and approaches for overcoming the obstacles we face every day.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, written by a man who himself has suffered from anorexia, is a very brave and honest exploration of the disease. The author takes us on a journey with the man who has struggled with anorexic feelings and eating disorders for decades. He shows us a side of him we usually don't see. He reveals that his life as an anorectic was often hard but very good and rewarding. He gives us the perspective of someone who lived through it with honesty and compassion. While it might be difficult for some to read, this book will give anyone who is interested in understanding how anoreytic feelings are actually caused, a new perspective. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. The theme of a woman discovering her body and identity as she goes through puberty is a very real one for me, and one that's unfortunately still quite stigmatized and misunderstood by many. And, like the title suggests, it's also a lot of fun, filled with stories from people in a wide variety of sexualities and genders. I particularly enjoyed the stories of female drag queens, straight women who crossdress, and bisexual and pansexual people.  It's great to see that people are out there like me, being themselves, and that it's okay to be proud of who you are and to be yourself, no matter what others may think. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book.  It is written by a well-known author who gives great advice.  I like this advice about setting goals for a career.  Some of the ideas are good for every kind of professional.  There is also good information about finding a good job that matches your skills and talents.   The book also has a great chapter on how to deal with a difficult co-worker. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite novel so far in the series is A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and this one is even better.  It's the same guy, and yet so much more.  There's so much wisdom and grace in his writing, I feel like he's reading my thoughts as I write them.  He brings out his sensitivity, his empathy, his knowledge and his humanity, which makes him truly beautiful.  I'm already planning to read the next novel in theseries. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really good. It's so good that you wish that it were perfect.   It's the kind of book that makes you want to write a sequel, or something to the effect of 'I could have done that, too.'   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been trying to get into the genre for a while, but never seem to be able to get ahold of the ones that strike me as being better than average.  I liked this one, but didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  It seemed to me like a very dry, dry copy of the 'best' book, with almost no characters, just one paragraph on each, and a lot of exposition about what each character does and why.  This wasn't that bad, but it didn't really strike me that strongly enough, and it made the whole book a bit dull. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a long time reader of the original Harry Potter books, and I always enjoyed the story. I've read every novel in the series, but for whatever reason I never really wanted to get the movie. I just never seemed to find much to like about it. I was surprised that a sequel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was made. As a big fan of the books, it's an absolute joy to read. This is the first of what will probably be many sequels. The main character is still Harry, but this time he is the leader of the Order. The book is written in the third person, which can cause problems with the plot if it is not used properly. Harry is now older, wiser, more mature, and a little bit of an ass to the other members of the order. He also gets the Order involved in a new mission, but he finds himself in a situation that requires a bit more cunning. The other characters are also much improved from the first novel. The characters that were originally annoying and annoying now aren't that way at all. The author takes some liberties with the magic in the books. I don't mind them too much. I'm a little more of a realism kind of person. Harry doesn't have a wand or any magic of his own, and the books just don't describe how they work. I would probably be okay with a character having one magic, but Harry's is really something I hadn't seen before. The Harry in the movie is really pretty close to the book Harry, with his intelligence and his sense of right and wrong. I am not quite as into the Harry Potter series as I was in the first book, but I found it very enjoyable anyway.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been waiting a long time for a serious exploration of what happened during and after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is it. It's a great book, with great analysis and an engaging narrative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book contains a great deal of information about the development of language and the role that culture plays in language. The author uses examples from various cultures to give an overview of their linguistic development and how they came about, giving examples like Chinese, German, Hindi, and Japanese. I found this to be a very interesting book and I highly recommend it to all who are interested in linguistics or in learning more about language. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very good. It has the right balance of historical information, psychological insights, and humor.  I would recommend it to a variety of people who are interested in history or the psychology of the mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good book for the beginning SF fan:  It is full of good ideas and good SF stories, and it has a great concept: a world where the population lives inside virtual realities called "suns." Â  The first story in the book, which is about a group of people living in these new realities, is especially great.  The characters are just right: the "real" world is very colorful, and the reality inside a virtual sun is very cold and black and lonely, with little to do and much to fear.  I wish this book had been written a decade earlier, but it is still good.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed    This book does a good job of making it clear that people like the way the United States has run things for a long time and how it was a necessary evil that served some beneficial purposes. I didn't agree with everything, and I wish the author had included more references to historical facts.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a good primer on how to do a great job of research when you have a limited amount of time or want to be as efficient as possible.   In the first section, you discuss how you need to find a topic that you know is interesting and write about that.  The next two chapters are about what to do in terms of reading research and using it as your primary source.  I think this chapter on reading research is the one that most people can relate to.  It provides a good definition of "research" and the reasons you should do it, such as finding good information that will be important when you are writing or doing research on your own.  This chapter also has a lot of good examples of how to find good information on the Internet and from sources you can find for free. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A really good, very well-written history of the American Civil War.  It's important, even if it's not a straightforward narrative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The problem with being a modern woman: You don't know what to do with your life."   This book is a perfect example of the female mind:  it can be as well-intentioned as it can also be shallow and selfish.  I was always a bookworm and used to look forward to the next book in the series.  The last one was really hard and left me feeling confused, because the author clearly has a firm grasp of the science and literature about women.  However, it seemed like she was trying to cover a lot of ground with very little in the way of depth.   In this one, she is more or less just discussing the symptoms, and trying to describe what you can do to correct them.  What is so important is that her book can be a great tool for those who want to learn about the differences in women's brains, which is something they may already know (especially if they are female), but who want a quick read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My first time reading a book that isn't a self-help book, I had to skip through a couple of pages, because I just couldn't figure out what was the point of it. The author tries to explain the benefits of being a good leader, but the end of the book just ends in a "you know what? I guess I don't believe any of it anymore" kind of conclusion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great historical work on the evolution of the American economy. It's not about the stock market, though it does offer a very useful account of its rise and fall. Instead, it's about how the U.S. economy evolved from the late 19th century until the end of the 20th. A lot of this has to do with the fact that the United States began to develop a domestic industrial base by the mid-20th century and gradually began to export goods and capital to other countries. The U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all began to open up their markets to U. S. goods and services. In addition, as trade and investment flows were growing, the cost of living in the U, S., and Australia started to go down, which was attractive to a lot of American workers. Finally, the collapse of World War II put an end to the prosperity of the U., S., Australia, Canada, and the British Isles for several years. By the late 1950s, most of those economies had recovered. The United States, however, has not been as fortunate. While it was once one of the largest economies in the world, its industrial base is in trouble and it is not doing well economically. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very interested in this book as a follow-up to my review of the first book.  I have had some issues with the earlier book and had to stop and reread them in order to understand the content.  In my previous review, I gave the book four stars, which is not quite enough for me.  However, this book has some important information, particularly about why men are so reluctant to have sex, and how that can be addressed to benefit both partners.  Unfortunately, the book suffers from an unsatisfying ending as well as some typos.  Hopefully, a revised version will be published to correct these problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent. It makes me think about how I spend most of my time as a writer.  I'm an avid reader who is always looking for a new book to read and the best I've ever seen is "The Art of the Steal" by Richard Schickel.  There are some aspects of that book that I like a lot.  But other aspects of it that are really disappointing are:  (1)  It's not about the art of stealing, but the art behind stealing.  (2)  The author doesn't even know that the book is called "The Steal."  Instead, he just refers to it as "The Gift"  (3)  He says that the only way to really steal is with the gift of humility.  He gives the example of a rich guy who steals things from his neighbors:  He makes the neighbor feel bad by leaving a note on the door, which the neighbor doesn't want to read.  The neighbor doesnÂ´t like the note.  So, the guy gives up on the idea of stealing. I find that a pretty sad way of going about it.  To actually be embarrassed by the fact that you are stealing from someone else is a pretty low standard.  It seems like the guy doesn't realize that the neighbors are grateful to him for the gift he gives them:  I am so grateful.   Thank you, thank you, you made my day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this remarkable study, David R. Benson explores the nature of learning and why the same cognitive processes that allow us to learn new skills also enable us to fall apart when we attempt to apply them. Benson shows how the brain's capacity for learning can sometimes be abused.  Benson writes:  "I'm just getting to the bottom of the paradox: Why, at times, can't you take something from the classroom that you've learned in another context?"  I would suggest that Benson is right.  When we try to apply a skill learned in the classroom to situations outside of the classroom, our brain's propensity for recreating the same skill (and falling apart at the same time) is the very thing that gives us that skill.  Sometimes we need to stop and think about why we were able to learn something before, but now we find ourselves unable to even apply that skill to the same situation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been looking for a good mystery to read and this one has a lot of twists and turns and the ending is so perfect. The mystery itself is interesting enough to keep you reading, but the ending was especially nice to hear. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in a kindle version, and I enjoyed it.   It is well written, and is a good historical account of the rise and fall of the Ottoman Empire.  I like how much historical detail is given.  As an American, I enjoyed the reference to the Civil War in the South.  The reference to Ottoman history is also a nice touch.  It was interesting to see how a European society was affected by a Muslim one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters are realistic and come across well.  Although they're all over the place (I liked them more when they were all together in the book), I liked them most when they are separated, as when the characters in "The Big Switch" are out of town (they had a wedding) and the characters from "The Old Man and the Sea" are in town (I found that their stories had a lot in common).  I'm curious to know what the publisher's plans are for the next two books in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first real exploration of the history of the Mormon church.  There is a lot of good information in here, but it lacks a thorough understanding of how Mormonism developed as a religion and was later influenced by the rise of the Roman Catholic Church, the Enlightenment, and other social changes.  The church's leaders, the "high priests" of Mormonism, seem to have done little to understand how the church evolved, but instead focused on preserving and improving the church's past.  They seem more interested in maintaining the status quo rather than finding new and innovative ways to change the church.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a really great book. As I've said elsewhere, I am not a fan of historical fiction, but I love the idea that some of the greatest minds of the last century worked on the projects that led up to the nuclear era. It has also helped me to think about the history of the space program from that perspective. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the only book I've read on the internet about the history of the U.S. presidency that I found to be informative.  The focus is on the first and second presidents, but the details of George Washington's early presidency are also interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I love how she takes the time to talk about the importance of getting out of the house to go for a walk or a bike ride. It's nice to have someone write about this in detail. I found it very encouraging and I hope that we can get out more.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading about the Mormon church for over two decades now. I was raised in a Mormon family and never found any problems with it, so I'm still trying to figure out why it has this negative image.  This is the first book I've read that I really liked and was able to feel a lot of how my beliefs were different than my parents'.  This book was great.   It was refreshing to see how much of my beliefs about the church have been molded over the years.  I know I was never really into the church the way my parents were, but I guess I have a lot more in common with them.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because my husband has a severe case of Tourette's, and he'd been struggling with it. I bought it for him to keep for himself. I also bought it in case my husband gets a hold of it.  My husband has read all of the books that he has read about Tourette, and was very disappointed that he had to read this one.  It was short and well written.  If you're in a similar situation, I would recommend reading this book as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book a long time ago in college, when I had a lot of trouble with the meaning of the Bible. I had never heard of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; I thought they all came after the events of Acts. After I read these books I had no problems believing that the Bible actually contained the truth. After reading this book I still believe the Bible is the inspired, authoritative word of God. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm giving the author's other book a four instead of five stars because I found it a bit thin on details.  The book is about one very particular aspect of the modern church's history: how it has dealt with the issue of same-sex marriages.  In the end, however, the author doesn't say much more than to say that it is wrong and the church has always been wrong.    The focus of the book, as a whole, is the rise of feminism and how the church, as one of the first institutions to recognize and respect women's rights, has had to adapt in ways it has not always done well.  While not an easy topic to deal with, the book makes for a fascinating read, even if the final results are not what she expected.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book on a difficult subject, the Church, and the rise of modern-day cults:  We were just about to turn in for the night, and my husband was saying that we should read a book on the subject of cults. He mentioned The Illuminati by John DeCamp, but I told him I wasn't interested. After we finished our meal of turkey and stuffing, I went back to my seat on the couch and pulled out The Late Great Planet Earth. After flipping through the first two chapters, I knew I had to buy it.  In this book, John De Camp details the rise and rise of the Church of Satan, an American-based satanic organization. I have read DeCamp's works on the Catholic Church and Mormonism, and although I was interested in this cult, I found them to be less than compelling. But The Church of the Final Judgment was a different story. It made me interested.  I learned about a cult that started in the late 1950s, called the New Age movement, that blended together Eastern philosophy, Eastern religious beliefs, Eastern practices, Eastern fashion, and some things that seemed like witchcraft. They eventually became what we know as the Church Of The Final Judgment. I'm glad I read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book very quickly. I have to admit that I did not care for the book. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the book covers a very complicated topic with very clear and informative examples. I'm hoping to learn a lot about that topic, but the book doesn't give me a lot of information to begin with. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like the fact that he has an intelligent, rational, and witty take on the events in the book.  For example, in one scene in the first part of the book, the protagonist, a military officer, is telling his father that the U.S. was responsible for the death of the Japanese emperor, Hideyoshi, and that Japan would never have surrendered to the United States unless it was assured that the United Kingdom would not do so first. In this scene the father explains why the United Sates could not be expected to give the Japanese the assurance that the British would not follow.  In this way the father is demonstrating how the emperor's death should have been seen as a bad thing.  But if the father could not see it that way, the emperor was doomed to die anyway, and it would be better to die by American fire than by the hands of the imperial regime in Japan.  The author shows the father's point very well and explains why he does not think the United State was in a good position to assure the Japanese that they would not be invaded.  I found this to be a very interesting and relevant reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is excellent. I had read some of the others on this topic, including "The Good and the Bad in Science," "Striving for Balance in the Heart," and "Good News about the News," but each of them was a bit less than perfect.  My favorite is "The Wisdom of Psychopaths: A Neuroscientist's Search for the Roots of Psychopathy," by Carol Dweck.   This book, by contrast, is very readable, very well argued, and contains a lot of valuable and original ideas.  I have already recommended it to others. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is interesting, the characters are interesting, and the plot is interesting. I like the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book while sitting next to my computer on my couch while I was watching a movie. I was surprised and excited by its contents. It's funny, informative and it's quite funny. The book is written for a general audience, so don't expect it to be easy reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As my wife and I began reading this book in early August 2006, we were both immediately intrigued and taken with the idea of finding a better life. We loved the theme and the characters, but found it difficult to believe that we would actually achieve it. Then, our lives seemed to fall into place, and we both found ourselves happily living in the suburbs. We had discovered the perfect life.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a lifelong fan of science fiction and fantasy, but I had never really read the books about it that I had been told about in school.  I loved the idea that my family might travel into the past for the sake of my education, and I read it with great anticipation.  As it turned out, I was not disappointed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised by the book, which I learned of through a friend's recommendation. I found it well written and thorough, providing excellent historical and biographical information about the members of the original Star Trek cast and crew, along with some insight on the casting process and the role of women in Star Trek. I have also been very interested in Star Wars, so I enjoyed learning more about the early years of the franchise and the importance of female filmmakers like Lucas, Nichols and Cameron. It also provided a valuable update of the character of Kathryn Janeway, who has become a cultural icon and is frequently described as the first female captain in Trek. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept and plot are great - it's a great tale of a group of people living on the fringes of society in an oppressive society in the middle of nowhere, all the while doing the things they can to stay alive. But I do wish it was a little more suspenseful. I liked the characters more than the plot, so the ending was a real letdown.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a well written book that covers the topic of the relationship between children and the people who are closest to them. Children are often left feeling alienated and alone in a situation where they are most needed. The author clearly has the insight to address this issue in a loving, caring and respectful manner.   I learned many valuable lessons, including that I didn't need a parent to keep me safe, and that a close friend could be very important.  I highly recommend this book, especially for parents. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very pleased by this book and recommend it highly to other students of history. It does not shy away from the dark side of world history and brings a new light into many of the more interesting events of the twentieth century.   As for the history in general, I found the author to be very informative and clear in his interpretations of events.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book because I was really looking forward to seeing the reaction of the children who had already been in schools. As far as my children went, I thought it was pretty good. My four-year-old is not good at reading, and we got the book after one year of intensive reading in the home. I found it much more fun and interesting than I had anticipated. The book is written in a way that is easy to follow and the illustrations are really nice. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good introduction to reading and creative writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I bought this book as a Christmas present for our two daughters.  We are both educators in the same field, so we are not often exposed to these kinds of books.  This one is very well-written and makes many points very well.  It is very clear that many people who have "lost their faith" are people who had no previous problem.  There is a lot of support in the text for people who feel that they have been abandoned by God, and that is definitely helpful in making sense of the problems we are seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. The author really captures the spirit of the "good" (and bad) people in the book, and she doesn't hold it back.  She writes of two characters, a man who takes great pleasure in seeing his wife's pain, and a woman who doesn't let her children grow up thinking that her husband is cruel to them. She talks about a "bitter marriage" and she describes how the husband had a habit of picking up little girls.  I can't say that I relate to either of these characters, but I did really enjoy her portrayal of them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a great book about how to live your best life as an Asian person.  It has a lot of great insight and it's very well written.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the Asian American experience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I read that seriously discussed gender as an issue, in the context of human nature, and I was interested enough in the book to make it my primary reading, and then to use it as the starting point for my own study of gender.  I am not interested in the gendered nature of the human race or of gender in general, but I do find it very interesting and helpful to see how many of our cultural assumptions have been based on the belief that men and women are the same, regardless of differences. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read "A People's History of the United States" in preparation for the PBS documentary about the book and was delighted with its scholarship and detail.   The book shows us that, despite a lot of talk about "democracy" and "freedom," in fact there have been a lot more people enslaved, oppressed, or otherwise oppressed than people thought,  And that is why people are able to take a lot from the past. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found myself very interested in and enjoying  The Woman Warrior.  The book opens with a chapter that is about a group of women that has been persecuted by the law for fighting back against domestic violence.  At the beginning of the book, the author tells the story of one of those women: a woman named Roseanne.  Roseanne was an alcoholic who had a long and storied career as a professional wrestler.  She would later become a model for many of the clothes and hairstyles she would adopt during her time as a successful pro wrestler. Â  The most interesting thing about Roseanne is that she believed that she was the only woman who could fight back against a male attacker and that she would be able to win.  Her belief was that if the man was able to successfully get the upper hand in a fight, it would make him feel more powerful and dominant.  When this belief took hold, Roseanne would fight back with her fists even though she knew she was losing.  To her, losing was inevitable because the man had power and dominance that no other man could ever have.  After a long, brutal fight, Roseanne managed to kill her attacker.  This chapter explains how, because Roseanne had accepted the idea that she had to have a male abuser beat her in order to have power over him, she had become complacent in the face of his abuse and had become a victim instead of a survivor.  What she didn't realize was that he was actually enjoying his domination and power over her.  I was very much interested in how this chapter explained how this came to be. Â 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've only read the first 2-3 pages of this book but I'm already very interested in exploring the topics and ideas in this book.  This book is based on research conducted by Dr. Richard A. Muller (the "God of the Gaps" in a previous study) that shows that only 1 out of 4 scientists accept what they say (or that they understand what they believe to be true). Muller's findings were published in 2001 but this study was never published in a peer-reviewed journal so it has gone largely unreported.  The results are so negative and the studies so rigorous that I was surprised that more scientists didn't accept the findings.  Muller's research shows that, even among scientists, most accept only 1 or 2 ideas and that those who do believe that there are many more problems than solutions. The problem is that we are in the process of creating a god that can do many things and there are lots of things the god might be good at but we can't test. We're creating a deity that might have all the answers but we don't know what the answers are. The results from this study were so shocking and so surprising that I wonder if they are a fluke. I've been trying to convince myself that the bible is true for 20 years and I'm still waiting. I know people have faith in their beliefs but this is so bad that I don't even want to talk about it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved reading this book. It's a great example of how important family is in our lives, and the importance of being a good parent. It makes me think of my own daughter, now eight, and how she may be suffering from some of the same things that are being described in this book, but is being held back from expressing her own thoughts and feelings because of her parents. I think it's sad that our children often have to face challenges that we never had to face, such as their parents being unfaithful, etc. I wish I had a book like this when I was growing up. It'll give me hope for the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most complete and accurate books on quantum theory available.  It is an exhaustive and well-written survey of all the current state of our understanding of the subject.  This book should serve as the bible for anyone serious about quantum theory, and is a good source of inspiration and guidance in the pursuit of one's own career in this field. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a collection of short stories by people I met on the road and who I met in real life. The stories are all about small-town America and people who make a difference by working together for the greater good. The authors have done a great job of making their characters relatable and likable. Each character is a fascinating individual who makes a positive difference in their community and the lives of others. The writing style is easy to read but sometimes feels slightly clumsy at times, but is certainly not unreadable. I recommend this book to everyone who loves travel and people.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been struggling to figure out how to read this book so I haven't yet but here I am with the first part    A great book for people who have been in an abusive relationship 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought this was an excellent book, one which I have been meaning to get my hands on.  While the book does not give much in the way of detailed discussions of the religious teachings in this book (and I can't imagine it would), the discussion about the various interpretations of the Bible, the nature of God, and the question of how "good" a human life is, are very interesting and well written. I found the discussion of this book very useful and a must-read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been thinking about this book ever since I read it. It's a book about love and life and marriage and I've found myself drawn to it ever since. I've loved many books about the subject and I know many more will soon come, but I don't know how I've not read this one yet. I'm hoping that this one will be one of them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely loved this book.  It was an interesting read that I found fascinating, and that I thought I'd already read, but this one was written better.  A great deal of the information came from the authors' personal experience, which I found very interesting.  I was also struck by how little this book seemed to have to do with the recent financial crisis.  The authors' story of going back and forth on whether they should buy a home, and whether they'd be better off with a cash-out instead, was also pretty interesting. I'm not saying that the authors were wrong in this decision, just that they didn't make the choice they did for good reasons. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book I have been wanting to read for many years, but couldn't because of its subject matter and the fact that I don't want to read about how my father was a racist. In this book, he admits that he has been a racist throughout his life, but he never used any of it as an excuse to be racist, nor did he ever use it as a crutch. Rather, he used his racist views as a way to help him achieve a good outcome: he believed that by being white, he would never be a target for the Black Panthers.   The book is short, but it is a valuable read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's hard to think about a bad book, but I'm going to admit this one is a real stinker.  It reads like a hastily written and poorly edited version of some poorly worded pamphlet from the anti-vaccine wing of the antivaccine movement.  The arguments and assertions made here are so clearly wrong it's almost insulting to read.   There are a number of factual inaccuracies that really need a rewrite (in order for the book to even have the slightest credibility to it).   But what really irks me is the way the authors use scare tactics to try and convince their readers to be afraid of vaccines, which in this case includes scare tactics that have been shown to be utterly false and unsupported by the evidence. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's really good! I've found that a lot of books on philosophy just have the same basic premise:  The best way to make sense of the world is to take a hard look at how things work, and then to make a list of things that seem weird and unworkable. I just don't buy that.  When I think about the philosophy of quantum mechanics, I realize it has no real use for everyday life.  But it's good for the kind of stuff that philosophers are good at, like philosophical puzzles and moral philosophy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was looking for something to make my writing better.  This is exactly that.  A very engaging book.  I've already recommended it to other authors...
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you've never listened to John Lee Hooker's songs before, this is a good introduction. If you do, you'll have a good time as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that doesn't really have any surprises or plot twists. It is also pretty dry and uninteresting. Still, I did find myself wanting to read more, and that is worth the price of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book quite interesting and thought-provoking.  I did not have much interest in the subject matter in this book, which is somewhat dated, and the general style was a little too wordy for my taste.  However, this is an interesting and thoughtful exploration into the historical impact of women in history and how it influenced society in a myriad of ways. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book, I especially like the fact that it shows that all races can be good Christians in our society if we just try. I would not give this book 5 stars but it's well worth a read. It is definitely the best Christian book I have read in the past year, I just wish I had a copy when I first started 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best part of The Little Prince is reading it to my son. He can see the parallels with his own life and how the book is just as relevant today. He even asked his sister to read it to him and she's so pleased that she has gotten to do the same. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed the "dangers" and "challenges" of the book.  One part that really stood out for me was when Dr. Wright mentions the "Pagan" origin of the practice of Yoga.  In this book, he states that this practice originated with the worship of the sun goddess.  I found it interesting that he stated that the ancient Hindus worshipped the sun and its goddesses and that the practice is "derived from that religion."  It is interesting that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the man credited as "the father of modern Indian Constitution," who was instrumental in establishing the Hindu-nationalist political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, also stated that "there is a Hindu doctrine of 'the worship of nature as the Lord and Goddess.'"  I find it interesting to see that Dr Wright states that Hinduism is one of the oldest religions and that this ancient religion worshiped the sun as its "Goddess" or "Guru."  I thought the book was interesting and gave me a little more knowledge of the ancient world that I did not have in my previous studies.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like the way this book deals with the subject of religious freedom. It is not very popular in the US at the moment, and people don't realize what a strong position religious freedom has on other freedoms, including free speech. This book shows how religious liberty is a precondition for other freedoms. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-read for anyone interested in the subject of religious freedom and its relationship to the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s.   The author, Charles C. Haynes, has a fine grasp of the historical context of the civil rights movement.  He uses this book to show that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and other groups that advocated racial integration were also deeply interested in preserving religious freedom for people of all races.  It is not a simple case that one can simply "blame" the SCLC for the civil unrest.  I think that the Southerners, on the whole, were well-meaning, but they were also in a position of weakness.  The SCLIcents had already suffered through their share of racial strife, and they saw that this problem could only be solved at a political level.  They thus adopted a different strategy: they made racial separatism a centerpiece of their theology and advocated it as a solution to the problems they faced.  Haynes provides a good picture of the complexity and strength of the SCC's religious freedom policies, which included: allowing ministers to lead Sunday worship services without being asked to serve black congregations; allowing ministers and lay people to live side-by-side, and sometimes together, in the same home; allowing black ministers to distribute their religious literature on street corners in black neighborhoods; and allowing ministers (including the minister of a black congregation) to serve on a city council.  These are not the kind of policies you can simply shrug off as being of no consequence.  When Haynes speaks of the need to avoid "blaming" the "Southern Christian Leadership Committee," he makes clear that he is referring to the South.  This committee is widely seen as the main catalyst behind the Civil rights movement in that region.  That's the story that is told in most schools.  In my view, the SSC is, in fact, the major catalyst behind that movement, as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so glad I picked up this book! It is the perfect introduction to some of the basic knowledge and principles of human anatomy that most of us assume we already know, but don't. I learned more about the pelvic bones, the perineum, the pubic bone, and the anus from this book than I ever had from any one textbook before.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book, even though it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  The title is an indication of the author's interest in religious symbolism in art, so I expected the book to be full of quotations from religious texts. However, the book focuses on a different area:  It is well written, with a good number of illustrations.  I especially like the illustrations about the Greek, Roman, and modern churches, as well as paintings, sculptures, and posters.  It also includes interesting information about the life and times of some of the most famous artists in the religious art world.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book because I wanted a new perspective on one of my favorite authors, Peter V. Brett.  Brett's novels include several excellent novels, and this book is a good re-reading for me.  I like Brett a lot, and I was disappointed in a lot of the things I liked in his earlier novels.  This book was the book that got me interested in Brett's writing in the first place.  Vast in scope, Vast is a very good book in its own right.  The world building and world building in Vast was fantastic, and it made me realize that Brett really is a wizard when it comes to world building.  While I enjoyed reading Vast, I felt that I could have done without the story that followed.  It was a little too heavy handed and I felt like I knew something was up right from the start, and the book just didn't do a good job of justifying the information I got from it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  It has lots of good anecdotes about how people use and abuse the Internet to try to improve themselves.  Although some of them are true (such as the time I bought a used copy of The Art of the Deal from a used book store), it's still a lot of good "Internet stuff" that can be made into a movie or book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book to my children, and they were both quite interested, but my 7 year old was less enthused:  In the last chapter, "The New Adventures of an American Teenager," a young boy, John, is described as having "the worst personality of all." He is "unable to be bothered with trivial matters; in a word, he is a'shyster.'" In the next chapter, John's older sister, Susan, is accused of "shoddy work" for which John is the scapegoat, but the accusations are not quite true:  Susan is not shoddy, but she does sometimes get things wrong. In this book, Susan is the good-hearted young girl who "puts a lot of effort into everything she does; she gets a lot done." John, in contrast, is a "disgruntled worker," "always up in people's business," "hard-working and lazy" with a "bad temper."  My boys were interested in reading about John, but not in reading a book about John. They were interested enough in this book about Susan that they tried to copy some of her manners. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The second book in a trilogy is great. This book has so much depth to it.  A nice mixture of character development and plot twists.  The characters were well written and the plot was excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those rare books that is perfect for a summer vacation or weekend reading, even if it is only for the last hour or so of the day.  I have not read many non-fiction books, but I really enjoyed the variety of topics covered in this book.  The author discusses some interesting theories about how people behave that make me feel like I am sitting next to the best professors at university.  This book is highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleasantly surprised by this book.  The prose is excellent and the information is both clear and interesting.  I have not read any of the other books in the series, but I am going to give this one a go. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't usually read YA books, but I've been wanting to read this one since it came out.  A boy who is sick and can't be cured learns from a psychic that he is destined to win the lottery and has the ability to heal others from a very severe illness. The book has a very fun and upbeat style. It's not as serious as I expected, but there's a lot of humor and adventure.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book, especially the part about the old lady's son.  She knew that the boy was a genius from an early age, and it was evident that this knowledge made her feel much better about herself as well as her family.  It was nice to hear about people's experiences as I've had some of my own and have felt similarly.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I've read by one of my favorite authors, Terry Brooks.  I love the originality, and I love Brooks's descriptions.  He captures the characters and their personalities in a very effective way.  Brooks is also able to give voice to many of the more mysterious characters of the book, as well as some of the less well-known people.   The characters are so well-written, I think it is difficult to believe they are fictional.  Despite the flaws, I am very much looking forward to the next Brooks book,  and will be adding this one to my ever-growing list of books to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent resource. It's been very helpful for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am still amazed by how well this book relates to the real world. We all have a certain "I feel  " factor that may come and go, but there is always a comfort zone within which we can re-establish a level of normalcy. And that comfort zone is when we take stock of the lessons we've learned. It's been a while since I felt like I had learned anything new about myself or others, and now I feel like I know quite a lot.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   In a perfect world, I would have loved to find out more about the actual process of a writer's writing.  To me, this was a slow-burn book, the kind that takes time to really sink in.  If you like writing, this will have you reading for many, many years.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was born and raised in the midwest and was fortunate enough to be exposed to all that there is to see and hear and know about the country and people that live here. I think that my life experiences have shaped my views on politics, which is now a central part of my life.  Although I have no real interest in the subject, I do believe that this book will help many people make informed decisions about the future of the United States. I was struck by how similar some of the issues in the book are to current events. For instance, how are we dealing with the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear power? The threat of terrorism? I think this is an important point, but I don't think it's the only thing that makes the book valuable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book!  A good introduction to the Christian faith for children.  It's really entertaining, and I can easily see how this would be a fun book for a young Christian boy to read.  There are a few pages that are more for children, but they're well done and well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is well-written and the information is very helpful.   I've been trying to figure out why I am depressed, and reading this book helped.  It's always been my belief that my feelings of depression are caused by my biological make-up, not by the events of my life.  I was never sure if the author would find the same results as I did. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am not much of a writer.  It takes me forever to put together a sentence or two.  But when I read The New World Order, it came out of the blue.  I thought, "Wow, there is something I need to do to prepare for what's coming."  I spent the weekend reading about all the things in the world that are coming.  And I think that I have been studying them for a long time, in preparation for what is coming.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book really helped me with some personal issues that I had been dealing with. It was really helpful to see other people dealing with the same problems. It also made me realize that many people who have been in the same situation as me might be having the exact same problems as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazingly good book on the history of a popular but utterly bizarre Christian cult known as the Jehovah's Witnesses. It's a bit hard to swallow at first, but the more you think about it, the more reasonable it looks. The most important thing to take away from this book is how a bunch of people who believe in a completely false book can have such an impact on the rest of the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just finished Ian McEwan's The White Album, and can't recommend it highly enough. This is a brilliant book, and it is a joy to read.  I was surprised by the amount of information that McEwen covers, particularly about the role that culture plays in society.  While the book doesn't cover it in detail, I believe that he's arguing that in certain ways culture can have a more powerful influence on us than genetics.  McEwin's theory has had some early success in the psychology literature, as well as in social sciences, and his book looks like another good example. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found it to be very informative and interesting. I was a history major and it really reinforced what I had learned the previous fall.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book, even though I have to admit I've seen it many times. It is clear and accessible without being preachy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am always looking for a good introduction to the Bible, and this is it! I was intrigued by the title, and even though I didn't know the author's identity, it was good to see her name on the title page. It helped me keep my expectations realistic, and I was glad to learn that some authors do have a name or at least a handle.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best book series I've read.   I've enjoyed every one so far.  It always takes the characters in the right direction and keeps them from being entirely annoying.  They never seem to be able to settle down into an old pattern of living (as one of my characters once said, "It's like we live forever")   But despite this, they are still interesting and likable enough to keep me interested.  I even gave up reading this series for awhile to help someone who was having a hard time with one of these books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am reading this book in preparation for my writing course next year.  It is the first real book I've ever read on the subject, and I think it's going to be a great resource.    In addition, it's the first time that I've seen a non-traditional approach to the study of the Scriptures and the Bible (i.e. using the "scholastic" approach, rather than the "progressive" approach.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a self-described "reader of books" who usually doesn't really like reading books, but this one took my breath away. I had been reading a lot about the history of the church in light of modern scholarship, and while I am not completely convinced of the official story (e.g. the Book of Abraham) I liked how they handled the Abrahamic religions and what some of the more controversial issues are.  I liked the way they handled those issues, even though I didn't think all of them were as cut and dry as I initially expected.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. The main theme of the book is the relationship between humans and robots. While there are some flaws, the book does a great job of making you think about how robots will eventually replace humans and what humans will be like without robots. I also really liked the book's use of humor.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't understand why people hate books this much. My only criticism is that I felt the narrator was more present in this book than in some of the other books I've read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought that this was a great book. I loved it.   It is an easy read with good explanations.  I would recommend this book to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think the most compelling thing about The Unstoppable Book is that it is so funny. The author is clearly a natural comedian, and has a quick and funny sense of humor. This humor is very much at home in an academic book on The Great Depression and, I think, a really important book in its own right. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been struggling for some time with the idea that a religion can teach morality but not always love. It was a hard read at times but I found I could empathize with the character of Mrs. Beauregard.   Her faith seems to have given her the strength to live through the terrible loss of her husband, but it also seems to be a constant hindrance on her love life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the world of magic and its practitioners now. It's not like a Harry Potter book where there's a big, complicated set of rules and magic and magic users are all a bunch of idiots. Here, the magic is kind of fun but not so much that the reader needs to read more. The main character is very bright and is really good at his job, which is just being an interesting human being (and one that's a bit off on a few points, but that's to be expected). He gets in a bit of trouble, gets into a car accident, and loses his job and his girlfriend. He comes out the other side more or less unscathed but doesn't have much else to show for it. The protagonist doesn't always do well in school, but at least he's not a total loser. The book ends on a note of optimism, but I think that's just because the world's in better shape now.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm looking forward to reading The Death of Superman. It sounds interesting, and it looks like it will be well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I first read "The Road Less Traveled" in a college class on the Great American Novel.  The book was an instant favorite.  I bought the Kindle version and the audio version  at the same time.  Both are worth the price. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. It covers a wide range of topics, from the rise of capitalism to the problems of climate change. It has a strong focus on technology and innovation as an engine for creating wealth and power, and the problems we will have in the future if this engine is not properly regulated. It also offers some good explanations of some of the more bizarre aspects of capitalism such as the "trading at will" clauses in many contracts. However, one of the most striking passages came when he explained that although capitalism might be a great engine, it is also a dangerous one. He wrote that capitalism is a "self-destructive system". And that is the problem that I found most compelling. Capitalism is a very positive system. It creates wealth and abundance. But that doesn't mean that it is good or that we want it to continue.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really liking this one. A book on how to be a good mother, how to communicate with your children, how not to be overprotective but also not to try and take everything too seriously, and all the rest of the stuff you can find online. I hope this book will find it's way into my house!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. It is the first part of a series on the Great Depression. I loved the first installment because it taught me the real causes and effects of the Great Recession. This book, however, takes things to a whole new level of importance. It gives the reader the complete historical facts that show the real reasons for the Great depression, and why the Great recovery, far from being the result of recovery, is really just another chapter in the story of how the Federal Reserve caused a long-lasting recession. I am very thankful that I have found this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. The writing is simple, and the ideas are very practical. The author offers an alternative to the typical 'college isn't the place to find success' attitude that many have, and that a lot of people seem to hold. While the first two chapters of the book were about being a writer, the last two chapters were about taking over as head of the accounting department at a large accounting firm. The book is about how to succeed in your profession, and how you can do it regardless of your college major.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book a great deal, although I thought it was kind of a mess.  In part, that's because it had been a long time since I'd read a book of such a long format.  Some people seem to have difficulty picking it up, either because it's so long that it's hard to follow or because it doesn't include many illustrations.  But there's also just too much information for it to be a good read, especially for someone who's not a biologist.  I'm still not clear on the genetic basis for "genetic diseases," but it is obvious that the genes that "make" people sick are not the same genes that are "making" other people healthy.  And the book's emphasis on gene research also means that it is a good source of information on how we evolved our bodies in response to the environment.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed  This is the book I've been waiting for.   It is a must-read for every new teacher of kindergarten through fifth grade.  The book includes information on different kinds of behavior problems in children.  There are lots of good pictures as well.  My favorite is a picture of a child getting on a swing and swinging to the right with the swing chain dangling.  This child was "fearful of swings" but the other children tried to comfort her and the swing broke.  I wish more parents had these pictures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I read this book together. It is about the impact of the internet on business. He enjoyed it, but I didn't love it as much.  The problem is that it is written with a business mindset, not a humanistic one.   It is written as though a businessperson was a great visionary who understood business (rather than, say, a human who saw a new technology for the first time and was immediately amazed at its potential).  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't apply to my life as well.  It doesn't explain what my husband does, and how it makes him happier, and more productive.  That was the main thing he read about in the book, but in an obvious way that doesn't make a lot of sense.  I don't think the author is a bad writer - it's just that the book is so oriented around business that it's not really a good reflection of the human condition. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received a free copy of this book as a review copy for another book. It was quite enjoyable, and a bit humorous as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book really helpful for my writing.   The writing was clear and concise and not overly poetic.  The examples were helpful in clarifying concepts.  If you have any writing problems, this is a must-read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this book when I was in my early 20's.  It was a quick read and was quite good in some aspects. I found myself wishing that more of his books had been written at the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was interested in the new book by William C. Dement on the early history of the United States. Dument is a good scholar, but he has also been criticized for not being sufficiently attentive to the racial aspects of American history. I agree with his critics in that there is not a lot of research in this book. He does focus, however, on the role of black people in shaping American history as an important minority group. The book also includes an interesting historical discussion of the first U.S. Congress, which had no African American members at all until 1849. I enjoyed this section much more than the other one, which was more about the origins of the Federalist Party.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really excited to read this book, especially because it's a nonfiction account of the early days of the United States, as reported by the pioneers. This book, however, left me disappointed.  The author does a good job of covering the major events and personalities that shaped the country's history, but it doesn't really do much to explain how it actually got to that point.  It is mainly a look at the early period of America's history from the beginning to the 18th century, and it's good that the author does this, because it brings a little bit more context to the way the country became what it was, but I found the story a little boring.  One interesting thing about this book is that it shows how the founders didn't really like each other, especially in terms of who was to lead the country in the future.  They both tried to get each other to agree to a majority leader, but neither was willing to do it.  I really liked this, and found it a little surprising that the first president to make a serious run for the presidency didn't end up doing so.  There are some interesting stories about each of the founders in this book too, so it's definitely worth checking out.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent and one of my favorites.  I loved all of the details.  It is a good guide for people who are looking for something new and interesting to read.  If you are already an avid reader then it might be too much information at once.  But, if you're new to reading and are looking to pick up something new or interesting, this is the book for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite "biography" of Abraham Lincoln is by Dr. John Henry Fenn, The Man Who Would Be King. Fenn does a masterful job of describing Lincoln's early life and how he grew to be one of America's greatest leaders. He has even gone so far as to give Lincoln the rank of "Greatest American."   Fenn is the author of The Abraham Lincoln Diaries: The Personal Writings of Abraham's Son. Lincoln's writings are not only incredibly inspiring, but also reveal that he believed God was with him at every step.  I found myself quoting some of Lincoln's statements out loud and having a good laugh. I was also quite impressed by Lincoln's ability to relate to all Americans and to people from every walk of life. Lincoln was not just a political leader or statesman, he was also a great friend, a loving husband, a devoted father, and a great man in general.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. The main theme of the book is one of life-long learning and how that leads to happiness.  The book makes this obvious through numerous examples and by writing about some of the most intelligent people of all time: people like Einstein, Newton, Plato, Plato's friend Aristotle, and Socrates. Â  I believe that these examples will help readers in their own lives and in general in life in general. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as part of a class I took on writing historical fiction, and one of the students said she thought the author had been teaching her to write like this for several years.   This is exactly what she is talking about -- and it works beautifully  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  The plot was not original and the characters were generic, but I enjoyed the book a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed the book!  The writing is extremely well done, and the author manages to be concise while still conveying important information. I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. It is not a "how to" book. I really don't even know if I have to read all of this book before I can really understand it. It does give me some good ideas about what not to do in certain situations and what to do instead. I like how the book also makes fun of a bunch of the bad habits that seem to come natural to us in certain social situations.   It's a great read and it will serve as a good read while I'm working on a book about some other good habits: how to eat healthy, exercise regularly, and manage my time better 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in love with this book when I first picked it up in a book store. It just seemed right for my kind of writing.  I really appreciate that the author's own life as a gay man was reflected so beautifully.  There's just something so relatable about the experiences of being closeted.  It's like a friend or a relative who's been there and done that, and you don't have to experience it yourself to recognize the suffering and frustration that comes with not being able to tell the world how you really feel.  This book makes it possible for everyone to see it for themselves, even those of us who don't experience such life experiences as privileged gay men. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It took me a while to get into this book. It is so easy to get swept up in the story of a girl's life and never stop to think about who's really being affected by her. The author does a wonderful job of exploring the many ways that a girl can be a hero in the most different contexts.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fine book that examines the moral character of the most important figures in human history. Its title implies a moral equivalence between two great evils -- slavery and abortion. I find neither morally worse than the other. Indeed, I find the former far preferable to the latter, both in its ultimate results and its moral implications. There are some points that could have been made more succinctly. However, for me as a reader, the overall value of this book is more than outweighing these small imperfections.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "In spite of all her own misgivings, Jane Austen remains one of the great literary figures of the nineteenth century." --The New York Times A contemporary literary classic.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a self-help companion for those who are recovering from substance abuse. In the book, we learn that it is impossible to go through life unscathed, and that there are people who can help. The book does not present a positive approach to recovery, but it offers an important truth: if you find yourself wanting to harm yourself, please do not act on your desire. I found this book helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book back in 1991 and it was the first time I ever read about Native Americans.  I still remember reading about the "war" between the U.S. Army and the Comanche and how it ended with the U S. losing its Indian Territory (Texas) and much of the Comanches, most of whom had never been in the U.S. in their lives.  In this book, I think the authors capture the feeling of the time very well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's easy to understand but difficult to put down.   This is a good example of a novel I love and would recommend to many people.  It also has a lot of good images, especially of the American West, a favorite subject for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good read about a really important topic. There are a lot of excellent books out there about social issues but this one, written by a gay man with a lot more experience, is a gem. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished listening to the final three books of "Ender's Game" and am just now getting through the fourth. If I'm going to read a series, I always read them in the order they were written.  As I've read the book and re-read the books, I feel that the fourth book in the series is just a bit better.  It has the most action and excitement of the entire series, with some interesting new ideas and a very good ending.  This is the first book where I felt I was really learning something new about the Ender characters (as opposed to just reading about Ender and watching him go on adventures).  It also had the best character development of all the Ender books so far.  A lot of that has to do with how the novel portrays the Ender character, as well as the different perspectives of his friends.  In a lot of the other Ender books, the main character has the same friends and/or classmates throughout the book, but in this book he has more diverse experiences.  I'm also very interested in how this novel will be compared to the movie "Escape From the Planet of the Apes," as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a fascinating look at the psychology of lying. There are a couple of moments in particular where the author makes a very strong point.  First of all, what really drives me nuts about people who tell tall tales is that they have been told about something that never happened by someone who was also a victim of a hoax. In these cases, they simply can't tell the difference between a genuine lie and a false one.  The author has written a lot of books, and these ones stand out because of their insight. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was amazing! It covers an awful lot about the subject matter:  It explains all of the problems of the current system, and how it was created by political and economic elites. Â If you're ever in a political bind (as in, not sure where to stand on something), this book will guide you through the details.   It is not a dry book.  It's incredibly well-written and well-organized, and it makes excellent points.  I would recommend this book to anyone, and I would also recommend a copy of The New American Revolution to anyone interested in history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic read. It is a rare book that shows how religion and politics can be compatible in practice and philosophy, and how we may actually use our spirituality to better ourselves. It goes beyond the usual dichotomies between the good and bad of religion and religion and the secular, with a view of how a spiritual life can lead to a better society. It also demonstrates how some religion can be used to help our social and political systems improve too.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The one thing that I disliked about this book was the lack of clear explanations in the first two chapters as to what is meant by "a good story" and "a bad story."   I understand why they chose this approach, but it's not as if this is a difficult subject to explain (most of us are not writers), and this book also had a pretty large cast of characters (a number of whom I found very likable).  Also, I found the discussion of what makes a good story a bad one to be somewhat tiresome.  If you're only interested in reading a good one, then you could probably do without this book.  I think it would be better to start with  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book explains the difference between an authoritarian system and a nonauthoritarian one, and gives a great overview of the history of the American experiment in self-government.   It has also proved of great value to the American constitutional system - especially in relation to the power of the executive in our Constitution.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so excited to get this book.  It's one of those things that always gets me when I am looking for something new.  And I'm always looking for new books.  Even though this book is a little bit different, I found it to be fun and interesting.  I'm not sure how many people will like it, but I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great.  It is the first book in which the author deals directly with the problems of being gay and also with being a Mormon.  His approach is simple and clear, and I believe that the solutions he gives will be helpful to many who find themselves in the same predicament.  I especially like the discussion on "spirituality," which is something that I have dealt with quite a bit and have never really found a good answer to.  This is a great book to read and I would definitely recommend it to others.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It has an almost Shakespearean tone to it with a cast of characters whose names are so similar and one who's only distinguishing characteristic is he speaks in rhyme.  This is a nice and witty book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best thing about this book is how much it reminds me of the best of my favorite college textbooks.  I would love to see more like it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book.  It provides a solid historical basis for understanding the origins and development of Islamic thought.  The author discusses the development of early Islam through a variety of viewpoints.  He also makes clear that there is no clear connection between the early Islamic texts and the later, Christianized Islamic texts.  A brief note of caution is needed though.  If one has any interest in Islamic history or theology, this book may not be a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent summary of the development of the field. The book also provides an extensive bibliography, which is very helpful. The discussion in the book is not overly technical, so anyone who's interested in these concepts and how they've changed over the years can find the material very useful. The only criticism I have is the book could have used a few more photos. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have ever read. It is written with a simple, yet clear style that gives the information needed in a nontechnical way. The information is easy to understand and it shows how simple it is to read a scientific paper and do the math. It also explains the methods used by some of the world's best scientists.   The chapter on genetics was particularly interesting. It describes how a genetic mutation could cause blindness, paralysis, and death. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The authors take a few different angles on "Gone With the Wind" and all of them are very good. The book is a good retelling of the book and covers important information about the period, from the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and segregation to the film version and the impact it had on a nation.  The book also includes excerpts from the books "Memoirs of an Invisible Man," "The House of Mirth," "How to Win Friends and Influence People," and "My Fair Lady."  In addition to the book, the authors offer essays about the film and the cultural impact it has had on the world today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I highly recommend  The Woman Trap.  It is so much fun and a great book to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think there is so much here to discuss in terms of the nature of narrative in fiction, that I will be rereading all three books in the trilogy.  These books are all about the quest for identity, and I have spent a lifetime wondering what my identity is.  The central character in all three of these books is Anne, who has never been able to define her own "true self" (even to herself) and is only able to get to know her true self by interacting with others.  She discovers a new identity through her friendship with a former soldier, whose identity is just as mysterious.  I loved these books so much that I reread them in two days.  They were well-written, well-paced, and perfectly paced for young readers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book, though it was not as enjoyable as some of my other reading. It is written well, but I did not have a good time with it. It felt a little like a book written by someone who had just read a novel.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The    plot   revolves around the   friendship of three women,   Gertrude, Ruth, and Ruth's mother.  The women are so good that the story even manages to be funny at points.  Gekko Gertz is great as Gert: 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very skeptical about this book because most self-help books are just the same old stuff I've been doing. But I wasn't disappointed at all.  This book was very much tailored to my personal needs and interests, and it is a very good, well-written and helpful book.  It's not about what will happen to you if you don't do this or that thing, but about what you can do to become more successful.  If you don the best you can and stay focused, your life will change.  The book is full of great examples and you get to see yourself in these people and situations.  I also think it has a lot of useful practical tips on how to make decisions.   For example, in a section called "How to Choose a Good Mate," she discusses how to find a good partner and what you should talk about when you're meeting someone.  She also talks about how to handle negative feedback from other people.  All in all, a very practical, helpful book that you should give a try if you're struggling with your life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book so much that I bought the print edition after I finished it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great in its description of the origins and evolution of the modern world. While the book does a good job of explaining how the world worked before the invention of agriculture, it does not do a good enough job explaining how it works now. The book is mainly concerned with the rise of agriculture as the dominant technology. While it is true that agriculture has been around for some time and that we can now produce enough food for everyone on the planet, there was a very large, but also very abrupt, change in the way we produce food between the Stone Age and the 20th century. The change in farming technology was very rapid, and it changed the way people did agriculture in ways that greatly increased their environmental impact. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book about the historical roots of contemporary feminism, including an exploration of the connection between feminism and socialism. While some have suggested the book is too academic for a general audience, I found it easy to read and I think anyone who is interested in the history of feminism should give it a chance. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is so fun and witty!  Â I am already dreaming up new ways to have fun with my husband.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book about the U.S. Postal Service I've ever read.  I had never heard of the post office before, but I now have a whole shelf of it's things in my house, and I have a lot more respect for it.  My wife is a lifelong postal worker.  While the book is funny, it's really the depth of information about the Postal Service and it's employees that I found most interesting.  She takes us on a journey through the history of the Post Office, the development of the postal system, and the problems they had in the early days.  It's a fascinating look at what happened to a once great institution.  Thanks for sharing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished Ian McEwan's The Great Gatsby. It is, I think, my favorite novel ever.   It is so beautiful and so rich in detail that I just want to keep reading it until it's over.  I have had many excellent novels in my life, but this one stands out. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters, plot and overall message are the best things about this book.  Although the characters were cliche, the plot was well written and compelling, even though the characters would have made good characters in any other book. I enjoyed this book and it will be an excellent addition to my shelf.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been following the work of Dr. William Sears and Dr. Robert Jensen for a number of years, and   their writings on the positive aspects of a healthy lifestyle are excellent. They share the findings of numerous reputable studies and lay out the implications for daily living.  This book is no exception,   it  contains a comprehensive set of recommendations  to help people live healthy and fulfilling lives.  Dr. Sears and Robert Jensen  are both highly qualified health care providers.  I highly recommend  this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read several books by writers who claim to be "experts" in "women's studies" and so on, but this one stood out to me. It was one of the most interesting discussions I've ever heard in a classroom.  I would've appreciated it if they'd included some citations of primary sources, which is a common problem among writers and academics, but that's a small quibble. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. I found it very helpful, because I'm a medical student.  I'd heard of many of the theories in this book before, but I didn't think that I'd actually get to experience the science of them in my own practice.   It made me think that other doctors I knew who were studying the same diseases as me may not have this same benefit. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most important book on the topic of the Illuminati in a long time. This book has taken me months to put together and it is well worth it.   It has everything you need to understand what the Illuminati are, why they are doing what they are and how they get away with it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a lot of memoirs and autobiographies about famous people - including myself, and this is easily my favorite.  I enjoyed the anecdotes and the stories, especially those about the life of a real life hero.  And it's so refreshing to read a book about a woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main reason I liked this book is that it does not try to answer all the questions that it poses. It just goes to the heart of them. And then it gives a good answer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is very informative and entertaining, and I found it very informative in the areas of "badass women" and "manners."   This book will help you be more comfortable with women, and even your own father.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was skeptical about this book. As I mentioned, I was a very religious Christian when I was in school in the late 80's and 90's and had never even heard of the Word of Wisdom. I didn't have a "religious conversion" to any religion, but it did make me think about what I was doing and whether I would like my health to improve if I kept that going.   This book is just about that--how I used the Word to become healthier.  It doesn't tell you to avoid coffee, for instance.  And I find it interesting that she does mention coffee, but not about the potential health risks of drinking it.  She discusses a number of things that have led her to believe that the Word is true:  "This is not about avoiding caffeine. It's about having caffeine in moderation. There are several things that make coffee a good thing and one of them is that it helps one live more naturally and sustainably."  "The Word of wisdom is the best recipe for health I've ever found in the Bible." "My health is better than it has ever been, not because I drink coffee, not even because I have a lot of caffeine in my body. I drink wine. I eat fish and I'm happy."  She talks about how the Word has helped her get past her fears and the various health problems that came from them.  In a wonderful passage, she mentions a doctor who asked her a very important question: "How do you like to be treated?"  "Well, if it's done properly, I like to just go to the doctor," she said.  "And, what do you do with your health?"  His response?  "I use it to make myself stronger."   What a wonderful and honest response.  I hope that she continues to be honest in her writings.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a terrific book on the Holocaust and the atrocities that were committed against the Jews during the Holocaust. The author, an Austrian, has a masterful grasp of both the historical background and the events that led to the Holocaust, and he puts that information to great use in this book. This book is the perfect book to start your knowledge on the topic of the Holocaust: you get to understand how and why the Holocaust happened, and how it relates to contemporary day events, like 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful guide to understanding the world around you: from languages to physics.  It covers everything, from the creation of languages to the evolution of human beings, from a simple mathematical definition to the origins of the universe.   It's so comprehensive and well-written that I could see myself going through it all the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so much fun and a must-read for any self-respecting author or serious reader.  The writing style and flow are great, and the book has lots of great trivia, trivia that will definitely keep readers going.  Also, as a history buff, I found some of the details interesting, like that when James Madison wrote the Bill of Rights, it was a joke.   Overall, I would recommend this book for any reader who is interested in the U.S. Constitution or the founding fathers.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure who the first person was who said "You must be able to be nice to a girl with a mental disorder, but you can't be nice because you don't know what you're talking about."Â  I think I understand the "kind of" attitude, but I'm still confused about what I mean by "nice."Â  What I'm saying is that I don't consider myself to be "nice" or "smart."   My friends seem to have more success than me.  I don`t know what it is about me, but most girls who date guys like me are really, really nice. Â I'm kind of the "nice guy" in my family.   Â Maybe I have to be different from the others to get girls. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The premise of this book is intriguing: that the two most common sexual fantasies of young people are "coitus" and "homosexual sex."  This is an interesting idea, although the writing in the book is not great.  There are numerous spelling errors, many grammatical errors, and the occasional use of the word "fart."  Overall, though, this is a fun read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I was born in 1968. I remember being very excited to read about how a computer could be used to save data. The original program I used was called TRS-80, and the name stuck with me forever. When I saw that the author used TRS as the name for this new type of computer, I started to think about my own computer and the TRS tapes that I had used to store data.   After reading the book, I've decided to go out and buy a TRS system. I would be very surprised if the TSR's ever become obsolete. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book itself is a good one. This is a great introduction to medieval literature. The prose is crisp and easy to read. The images are well chosen, especially for such an early period. If you're interested in this period of history, and especially in a part of that period that has little attention or even recognition today, then this book will be a welcome addition to your collection. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! My students have never had a class on Jewish history, so this was great! The book contains lots of pictures and a timeline of major events from the Jewish people. It also tells the story of Moses, who was raised by a Jewish mother and converted to Christianity. I also appreciated that it was written by a woman, as well as that it included a lot of good information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I finished this book in one sitting because it took me so long. I liked this book.   This is a good use of "I didn't know" in an entertaining way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was initially disappointed by the low score I gave, but then decided to give it a second chance because of how much I loved it:  It's a very interesting take on the nature of time.  The characters don't really "do" anything in the book, except maybe go to a museum, but it's the time they spend talking about those things that really keeps you hooked.  And the way it's written makes it even more enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I finished A Life Sentence in one night.  I was overwhelmed by all the details of a man's life.  How hard he worked to get where he is, and how well he worked, despite the discrimination he endured.  It was an eye-opening experience.  The ending was emotional and heartfelt, and I cried, in real tears, when I found out that my man was going to die.  He had been given a "sick" note.  In retrospect, the whole story sounds like a nightmare.  But it wasn't.   He was a sick, but happy man.  What an important book to read to anyone thinking of writing a book about themselves.  Thanks 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.  It is written by a woman who is a woman herself.  I am interested in learning more about the women's rights movement.  This is a great read about the difficulties women encountered. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing I would add is that I would strongly recommend 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this lively and witty book, the British academic Richard Tarnas explores the idea that science can improve the lives of ordinary people. From a simple but effective method for treating common colds to a successful anti-aging treatment for osteoporosis, Tarnats' book offers a wealth of practical advice for anyone who wants to do more with their own health. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought I'd read a good memoir about the Vietnam War, but I was very disappointed.  The author does tell the stories of many of his friends and family, but he never seems to connect the war's horror to the actions of the US government or the American people.  He also mentions how some of his buddies went on to be successful in business, but the book never explores that issue.  I also found it strange that the book only mentions one incident in which someone was killed in a gunfight: that of Captain David T. Johnson, who was killed by an errant round in 1968 in a firefight with Viet Cong.  But this is the only incident mentioned in the book.  After that, it becomes very difficult to find anything to relate.  If the author had done a more in-depth investigation, I'd have understood why the war became so horrible and why the country seemed so indifferent toward it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In reading this book I had several things to say to the author: 1) As an amateur historian, I thought that she used a variety of sources to prove that Jesus Christ existed.  As a professional historian, and someone who uses a variety  of sources,  I found that she was totally without historical basis for this claim.  In fact, there is a good chance that the book was written by a group of religious fanatics (or perhaps atheists) who found it convenient to use the Gospels to prove a belief in a messiah after they  had already done so in the Goliad   2) While the author claims to be quoting the historical Jesus, she is quoting the disciples in their own words to prove the existence of Jesus, which  is not how historical accounts work  Â  3) I was really annoyed by the amount of information she gives in this book that was either not actually in the Bible  (like the details about the time of Jesus' birth), or that  didn't seem to be in the earliest sources (like what Peter thought about Jesus or whether or not Jesus ever said "I come from the Father").  All of that information was in the bible,  but she was choosing to ignore it.  4) Another thing I found really annoying was the author's use of quotes from the Giniad.  The first quote (in the first chapter) is from Jesus' first sermon (on Mount Olivet),  which is in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas, but is not from the Gospel of John at all.  I have to admit that I didn't notice this until I had a good look at the apk, but it's a little  surprising that it's not in the early sources (at least as an example). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book more than any other I've read recently.  While I'm glad there are other authors talking about similar issues, the authors in this book seem to have more time to do so.  For example, they discuss how men are expected to control the women in their lives and are given no other options.  Their solutions are to be more emotionally unavailable to their wives or to let their wives go at it (both of which I think are bad ideas).  I also like that there's more discussion about the issue of gender bias in the legal system. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. The research and the writing were superb.   For me, it was fascinating how many of the historical figures who appeared in various religious writings were either Christians or Jews, but also believed in spiritual beings. I thought that was fascinating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very disappointed with this book.  It's an interesting idea, but the execution is so poor that it feels like the book was written for a different audience.   The protagonist is a young girl, a typical 9-year-old who has been very upset with her family because of how they have treated her.  She is adopted by an adoptive family, but not before her family's religious beliefs are brought up, leading her to a difficult conclusion.  Although she has had some pretty good role models in the past, her parents are still pretty horrible.  They are also pretty terrible parents who don't teach their children anything valuable.  But despite this, she is happy to go to her "cool" family, who have adopted a Jewish child.  Despite the fact that she has no knowledge of the faith and doesn't seem to really understand anything about it, she still has a very positive attitude about it and wants to go.  Eventually, though, it becomes apparent that the whole religion isn't very pleasant and she realizes that she'll never be happy there.  I didn't like that she was only allowed to talk to her father about her religion, rather than to her family, whom she really wanted to speak to.  When her adoptive parents finally get involved, they treat her like a child who is always crying and demanding attention, not a person who has genuine feelings about her religious beliefs.  Even though I understand that this is what the author wanted to write, it's just not what I read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked reading this book   The way the characters were written was very well done.   Even the author describes how the two women are like brothers, with each carrying the other's spirit, making them a perfect match. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have enjoyed The Age of Anxiety by Michael McCullough. I found it to be well researched, well written, and well presented. McCullough is one of those rare writers who can read people's brains and understand their behavior in a way that ordinary readers simply can't. He is also one of the few writers who understand how to convey his messages with a humorous, honest tone.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was very good. I did not enjoy the second half much (in spite of its title) but that was because of my poor enjoyment of the first half. I think I would prefer not having to wait for the third half to see more of the characters and how it develops. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I've ever read on the subject of Islam. The book is extremely well written and, as an amateur in the field, I enjoyed the book very much.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The authors of this book, the "founders of the science of personal growth" or so they are fondly called by some, may well have been inspired by the "Power of Now" approach of Eckhart Tolle. Their book is about the impact that such spiritual teachings can have on the lives of ordinary people. The authors are not religious, and their approach can be a little jarring for people who believe in a very strict code of conduct and morality. Yet their advice is surprisingly simple: keep a daily journal. Keep a list of what you do and don't like about your life, and keep notes about how you feel. They suggest that people who have found happiness through such a discipline would find it particularly useful when they are faced with the need to make a major life change such as getting married or getting a promotion. It is also helpful for people struggling with addictions. They note that some of the most successful people in history have had some form of addiction in their lives. For me personally, the book has had an impact on my life because it has been one of the main tools I have used to try and stay in touch with what matters in my life.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book.  I can already tell it will be a classic in my next book group.  The author has a knack for describing the psychological consequences of a good and bad outcome, and then making you feel like you could've done things better, or that you were just unlucky.   It's an engaging read, as she talks about things like the meaning of success, how bad luck is a constant companion, and how having bad luck isn't necessarily the worst thing that can happen to you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can honestly say that I was completely sucked in by the first paragraph, then completely taken in by it's entire first chapter.  This is one of those books that will keep me reading for as long as I have to. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a woman who's been around the block a few times, I thought I knew what I was getting into when I started reading "Tales of Wonder and Woe." Unfortunately, I was wrong. In her book "The Joy of Pregnancy," Julie Bergner is more of an expert than her self-proclaimed "Tale of the Tampon" character. I was disappointed in that "Tampon Tales" is really just a collection of "I hate to be pregnant and want to put the baby down" stories. I thought "The Tampons Are My Friends" would make more of a difference. Instead, this "Totally Wonderful" feels more like the more familiar "I'm pregnant and I hate being pregnant" collection that's been collected on these bookshelves for more than a decade. I've always been a "don't let your emotions get the best of you" kind of gal, but this book leaves me feeling a bit "weird" on a few levels.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book about a very different type of book: a philosophical treatise.   I have been looking forward to reading this one for quite some time.  I really enjoyed the philosophical section, which is just excellent.  The section on the nature of time is a little too lengthy for my taste, but it does a good job of outlining some of the main tenets of time travel.  For a non-academic book, the philosophy sections are very good.  This book could easily have been a better one, but I think the non-philosophical sections are probably too long for most non-serious students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. The main characters are very relatable. Their lives are like mine (middle class, married with two kids, college educated, middle class, but a little behind), and they are dealing with the same things. They all have problems that I can relate to, and I wish there were more books like this one in existence. The author shows that she understands both the pain of being poor and the joys of being middle class. I am thankful that she writes in a way that isn't heavy-handed. I recommend this book to anyone who feels like they are in a similar situation.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm still trying to wrap my head around all of the science in this book (and I'm writing this review on my Kindle, which doesn't have the ability to automatically make the book book-friendly), but I enjoyed it very much. It's not perfect, and there are definitely some inconsistencies with the evidence presented in the book, but it gives you a good idea of how some of the more controversial ideas in the scientific community are actually held by researchers in that field.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book, despite the fact that I found a number of the factual assertions and comparisons concerning race and gender so off-base, and the portrayal of certain characters so offensive that I wanted to throw it across the room and scream. I can't even say I enjoyed the writing very much. It's so full of errors, I felt like I was reading an in-depth scientific study. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book that I've read about an Indian woman living in the West. It's quite the opposite of 'The Other Woman's Wife: The Untold Story of a Chinese American Woman in Los Angeles', as this book is very different. 'The Little Brown Hen: My Life as a Little White Hen' is about a poor white woman trying to keep her house, but ends up in a deep spiral of self-pity. 'Little Brown Hen' tells the story of a little Chinese girl who lived with her American mother for several years, and how her mother changed her for her own ends. It also tells of the author's experiences living in an Asian-American community in the Los Angeles area. While 'Little White Hen', as a novel, is the better read, 'The Hanging Bride' is probably the better book about an Asian woman's experiences, because it does so well in exploring how white people view Asian women in America. The Hanging Wife's main theme is that she is unhappy about her past as a white girl who was adopted and raised by her mother, and she does so by creating a new identity for herself. 'Reverie in Red: How I Found Myself in a Native American Village' is another excellent book about a girl who goes to live with an Indian family, and comes away with a deeper understanding of her culture and identity. The book does a great job of discussing the ways Native Americans see their cultures, and the ways in which Westerners view it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As someone who has been in therapy for years, I am so glad to hear about people who don't "get it" and are able to see what other people are "seeing" in therapy. I am also glad that Dr. Siegel is honest about the fact that it's hard to stay motivated, and the reality is that it is often a struggle to remain in therapy even when things are going well, and to stay accountable. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is considering or has already tried the therapist-dramatization approach.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been following the "science of" yoga for years and I am so glad to have it in my arsenal now. I am a lifelong yogi and I've learned many tricks from the best. The "science" part is very easy to follow (it's just a different perspective than what I've experienced in the past).  The exercises are a little more challenging than those I've done in the   yogic tradition, but I still love them and find it relaxing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was not a huge fan of this book, as the style is too pretentious to me. I guess I just don't like books that are so full of literary quotes. I also didn't enjoy the prose. I liked the book much better when I read it in print, and I think my opinion is probably shaped by reading the audiobook. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of the most complete and thoughtful pieces I have read about the history of the Jews in the United States. It contains information about the many different groups that intermarried during the period, the social issues of their integration, and the eventual assimilation of the Jewish immigrants.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been meaning to read this book for a while now and finally decided to grab a copy.  The author begins by laying out the general thesis that American government is flawed and needs to be changed in order for the country to function.  This is something that has been in my mind for a long time but I am glad he addresses it in this book.  As the author points out, the American Dream is an ideal that cannot be fulfilled in a country that is run by greedy, unprincipled politicians.  I agree and I've found that most of the arguments in favor of the American government I have heard come from the left.  It seems they want to believe that the government is good and the people are dumb so they don't need to do anything.  They believe that if the government puts its foot down on something, it will be forced to change.  But the truth is that the people need to step up and do what needs to happen.  People need to be willing to sacrifice for the greater good and do things that they normally would not do if forced to do so by their government.  That being said, I do think this is a book that people would benefit from reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a historian and scholar of American race relations and the Civil War, I was particularly pleased by the use of the writings of prominent white women in the history of the Civil Rights Movement.   These women include Mary Pendergrast, who wrote about her relationship with her father, a Union army surgeon, in the midst of the battles of Forts Henry and Donelson; Mary Pless, a former slave and author of a widely-respected volume on slavery and the war, In the Shade of the Black Flag; Jane Addams, a woman who was among the first black female congressmen; Mary Harris, a prominent slave and leader of the anti-slavery abolitionists, and Mary Church Terrell, a social reformer and leader who led the first women's suffrage campaign in North Carolina.  These memoirs, and the women who narrated them, make it possible to see the role of white women at the most challenging moments of the Reconstruction era, particularly the debate over whether blacks should be admitted to the National Convention and how blacks should participate in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of great advice and great ideas.  It does a great job of making sure that you are in a position to learn and that the information is not overwhelming.  Also, I appreciated how she pointed out how some of the most popular books are actually less useful.  If you can find a good source of good information online,  you can read some good books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a beautiful addition to the body of knowledge and resources available in the New Zealand English-speaking world.  It is a practical guide to improving the   pronunciation  of English and to improving  understanding  of the various  grammatical constructions, idioms,  vocabulary,  and historical events  in English that have been lost.  Although a few  passages are  rather dry, the bulk of the book is full of ideas and insight that are useful to all of us.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a gem, full of insight and insightful thoughts.   I was surprised how deep and meaningful many of my comments were.  I've read a few articles on the Internet that have similar ideas to what Dr. Pimple Popper had to say about the cause and treatment of acne   However, I am a physician so I was much more interested in her treatment of the emotional aspects of a bad skin day.  That's what I was really looking for.  If you haven't read this book yet, I'd highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book on early medieval European culture. It is a must-read for anyone interested in medieval Europe, both from a historical and a literary perspective. I also like the book because it does not simply present the information but asks important questions that are worth asking. The author begins by examining the impact that the European Christianizing movement had on the culture of Europe. This is important, because the early medieval Christianizing trend (which includes the Reformation) has been largely ignored by historians of early medieval Europe. The authors then turns to examine the impact of the Byzantine Empire in Europe, and the rise of the Carolingian Empire in Italy. The idea that the Carolings were successful because they were able to convert Muslims to Christianity, as the Carolists do in their propaganda, is a myth, but it is also a convenient narrative that is easy to swallow. I do not believe that the influence of Byzantium is responsible for the development of Carolingia. If it were, the Carolers would have had a huge advantage, and they would not have needed a military conquest of Muslims as the way to expand. In fact, the Byzantines did not succeed in converting Muslim rulers in Italy until the late 11th century. After the Crusades, Byzantinism was in decline in Europe. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished The Secret Life of Bees by David A. Bednar. It was the best part of my year, and I found the idea of the secret life of bees fascinating.   The bees can communicate by pheromones, so it seems like they all might be trying to get married. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book on all things French. I love both the book and the series, in particular the one-shot "Le Petit Prince" by Philippe Druillet. I got the e-book for free from my e-reading service and loved it. Thanks, ebook-reader.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was one of my most-anticipated of 2013.  I enjoyed it, but it was a bit of a struggle to get through in one sitting.  It's a complex book that deals with a number of topics related to social class, which I find particularly fascinating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The two books that I have read by Elizabeth Hardwick, "Elizabeth Gaskell and the Great Fire of London" and "Elizabeth Hardwick and the Birth of the New England Romantic Movement" are really two sides of the same coin. While Gaskell's book is the more scholarly work, Hardwick's is the one that will be the most popular. Gaskell is much better informed and her scholarship is impressive. Hardwick is a bit more accessible and can make the book more fun to read. However, as is the case with most Elizabeth Gaskell books, both Gaskells are good, but they are not the same book. While Elizabeth Gaskelfd is a masterful storyteller, she is a much more restrained writer than Elizabeth Hardick. Gaskell is more concerned with the development of the new Boston culture, while Hardwick does the same thing in New England, but the two books are not entirely similar. Hardick is far more interested in the personalities of the people involved and the story that emerges. Gaskin's stories of Boston's decline and the creation of the Boston-New York culture gap is more about the people and the city itself. Hardi
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book about 7 years ago. I was in the process of making my way through graduate school at that time, and I read it cover to cover and decided to read the entire series of " The Secret " at the time. The book has a very compelling and thought-provoking title: " The secret to success is to keep changing the things you don't like " and as I think back on it, this is one of the biggest takeaways I got from the book: changing the way you think is the most important thing you can ever do.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the perfect book for those who have been through an abusive relationship and want to have a place to go to talk. It gives a good overview of abuse, the process of recovery, how to create a safe space, and how to cope if you don't believe that you are at fault. It is also written in a gentle, non-threatening voice that is a great aid in coping with the trauma. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a college student. The subject matter was not new to me. I've always understood that women are the weaker sex in all ways - physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I think it's important to understand this. This book was not intended to be a feminist manual, nor was it written as such. But it was written in such a way that it could be read as a feminist book. The author is very honest about her experience in the workplace. The title, Women, Work, and Power is a good one and the book is definitely aimed at women. It is aimed at all women, not just women who have been in the work force, but is definitely for women who haven't. It's definitely a book for women to read, but it's also a book that can be read by men. I really enjoyed reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this very entertaining and educational.   It does not try to reinvent the wheel, and the author has great knowledge of the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received a copy of The Devil's Evolution in exchange for an honest review. I had no idea what to expect, but I thought this was a good read.   The book has the feel of a classic academic text, with all the usual academic jargon: terminology, arguments, references.  The arguments are interesting, though not particularly original.  However, the main points are well-supported by many other sources, and are not just a matter of personal opinion.  I especially liked how the author was not afraid to use the word "devil" and "reincarnation" in the book, which I hadn't been able to resist while reading other authors' writings.  Despite the author's claims, this is not some kind of "myth" (if you can call them that), but rather a reasonably well-reasoned book by a rational and well-informed individual. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I have to tell you about this book. I had so much fun reading it!   It is hilarious, and I loved the way the narrator talked about his favorite food - chocolate chip cookies, while his wife ate macarons and other baked goods  I can't wait to read more by John Grisham 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book of Mormon makes a good impression on readers. I'm a Mormon and I was disappointed in the first edition. The author spent a great deal of time on details that were superfluous to the central argument and which did not help anyone's understanding of the Book of Abraham. A more helpful addition would have been a better discussion of the book's title. It was the wrong book. The title says it all! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have tried reading more than my fair share of fiction books by men. I have a good idea of what the main characters like and don't like. And I know, when I am reading a book, what it is going to be about.  When I read The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, I thought it was about spiritual awakening. When I went to bed after finishing it, I knew it was more about how it feels to not make the same mistakes over and over again.  This is definitely not Tolle's first book that I enjoyed. He has a long history of writing about the power of positive thinking.  And he certainly knows how to tell a good story. I'm sure that his next book will be a lot better than this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I were delighted with this book, which was the first of a new series of books about the great characters in the Kingverse.   The characters and situations are all handled with an incredible amount of love and respect.  The story moves along rather quickly, but never gets bogged down in excessive exposition.  King is able to tell a gripping tale without the usual cliches.  His writing style is beautiful, and he uses his characters well.  If you've read one of these series you will surely enjoy them all. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My friend got this book and really enjoyed it. I liked it, too, but I didn't know as much about the history of the film. So I'm really glad he gave it a chance!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading a lot about this book by a woman whose name I can't remember. I was surprised that it's not really about race at all. The central story involves a white male professor who goes through a very painful period while his family is dying. This is part of the book's theme. But, I really enjoyed reading about the "good old days" of a different race.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy reading books by authors with whom I disagree politically. I agree with nearly every point made by Thomas Friedman, but have my reservations about his support for a military strike on Iran and his endorsement of a policy of "smart power." Friedman and his colleagues seem to believe that, by relying primarily on diplomacy, it will be possible to prevent a military conflict. But that's a dangerously naive notion: diplomacy has a terrible track record, not to mention the enormous costs it imposes on our own economy. The Bush administration learned this the hard way, and it seems they still believe it. In any case, I doubt that Friedman's plan of "strong leadership" will work either, or at least not if the US continues to rely so heavily on diplomacy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  For some years I've been thinking about starting my own Christian retreat center, but have been hesitant to commit the hundreds of thousands of dollars it would cost.  With The Way Home: Living With The Heart Of Christ In A Relatively Unorthodox Christian Home I finally decided to take the plunge and buy the first book in the series.  The book is not just about building your home.  It is also about building a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  And what a powerful, liberating, and fulfilling relationship it is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a big fan of Dr. Seuss ever since I was a child, and I have really enjoyed most of his books ever since.   This book is my favorite so far.  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is another of his fantastic books, and this one is just as good.  The characters are so realistic, and the story so well-crafted that the ending left me so satisfied I cried. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. I was especially taken with the last few chapters, as they are full of fascinating information and advice about marriage and life.  The author also has a unique perspective on the life of a single mother who doesn't believe that the church can change her, so she is leaving it all on her husband.   She discusses how the church has contributed to their divorce (as well as some other issues) in great detail.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is good because it is readable and does not attempt to be too complicated or technical. It is very readable and well-written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book on the subject of women. It covers the same material as "Happily Ever After: What Happens When a Man and a Woman Fall In Love" with a lot of added insight and understanding. It's not the same subject matter, but "HAPPILY EVER AFTER: What happens when a man and a woman fall in love" isn't bad either. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book very seriously. I didn't realize how important it is until I was reading about the time when her grandmother died, and she lost her ability to remember. I wasn't ready to give up on that particular part of her life, but she realized that a good education and a strong community can be a lot more comforting than having memories from her past. That really resonated with me, especially after I read the other two books I'd just finished - about women whose lives were cut short by their marriages. This is a great book for those who are struggling with some form of mental illness or loss - especially one that can cause a loss of memory and communication - and that loss can be particularly devastating when it comes to family and friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little skeptical at first about The Great American Book Fair. After all, what are the odds that I would come across a book that, on first glance, appeared to be about the literary equivalent of an amusement park ride: A bunch of kids all walking through a giant labyrinth to get from A to B and back again?  I bought it anyway, mostly because it had been recommended to me by a good friend, but also because it was on the "must-read" list of the kids at the local library, which I thought was awesome.  The Great Books  (my second favorite book from this fair) was also at the library, and I was so pleased with both of them that I immediately picked them up to read.  I am a big fan of the nonfiction category at the fair, which is why I have purchased all three volumes of Â  I Never Told You  (which was so good I wanted to buy the whole book ). Â While these are great books, The Great Book Fair is definitely the book that I was most interested in.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and was very pleased to find this book.  It was a perfect complement to my first reading of the series in 1999 and has given me much more enjoyment than any of my other Potter books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book several times over the course of a couple of years. I always liked the idea behind it; I can't remember any time I felt like it took a wrong turn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "If you are interested in history, I can recommend this book with confidence: it provides a clear and compelling history of the Second World War, from the defeat of France's fascist regime in 1940 to the liberation of Paris in 1944. If you are a fan of the popular media, you will probably like it as well: it has all the elements that you'd expect to find in a successful fictional thriller: espionage, sex, love triangles, political corruption and murder."
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I were having a hard time with this one. I'm not sure why, but we just couldn't get into it. I was just frustrated that it was just more of the same. In the end, we agreed that it's not for us, but the author did a fine job in conveying the emotions of the characters. I give it four stars, but only because I couldn't put it down."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be extremely engaging. The writing style is conversational, which is good since you do not need to know what's being said in order to enjoy the experience. In addition, the author offers insightful, useful advice on managing expectations and dealing with people.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book I've ever wanted to read.  It contains what I think are the best writing and argumentation on the subject of race that I've read. Â  My problem is with the author's choice of terms.  He prefers "white privilege" over "race privilege".  I'm sick of these terms. Â  "White privilege" is a term I use in a general sense.  Race privilege is a specific form of privilege and is different from white privilege. Â  When I say "white supremacy", I mean the social, economic, and political status that white people have that people of color do not.   "White power" refers to the "power" whites have in society as a whole. Â  He also uses the term "racialized oppression" which seems to me a non-starter.  I'll leave it up to others to decide if racialized oppression is relevant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a fan of my local library's "The Essential Guide to Modern American Life" but I just wasn't looking forward to reading it on a plane.   This is the first "how-to" book I've read for the iPad.  The author, Chris Anderson, shows how the technology is changing the way people work, live, and play.  He also offers ideas on how to live smarter and healthier lives.  This was my first time reading a book about the iPad, so I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book   Because I am a recovering addict, I felt comfortable reading the author's perspective on this topic, which is in no way unique to myself.  This is a very thought-provoking book, and I'm looking forward to more of her work.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book on a whim on a long road trip. It was a great read! The book is short, but it has a lot of great content. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The most extraordinary account yet published of the Holocaust, and of the atrocities that resulted, is The Final Solution: Why the Germans Could Not Die is a stunning document. In addition to the chilling account of the mass murders by the SS, a remarkable account of German scientific experimentation during the war is recounted, as is the story of the 'Bundesmeister,' the scientific leader of the Nazi death camps. The narrative is also a fascinating account of life in Nazi Germany, from the beginnings of the movement to the destruction of the Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and others." -- The Holocaust in America "This book deserves a place in every library and book store. It is full of fascinating details of how Hitler, Himmler and others worked to develop and execute the Nazi solution. It also provides fascinating information on the Nazi war machine and its technological achievements." -- Choice "The Final Solution is an extraordinarily important book that, at every turn, adds to our understanding of the crimes committed in World War II." -- Robert J. Higgs, Professor of History, Syracuse University "This is an important and very good book. It presents a powerful account of how the Germans came to develop the technological means to kill millions of Jews and others who had no right to live. The Holocaust is perhaps the most important and darkest period in the history of mankind. The Final solution is a powerful and moving book." -- John H. Miller, President, National Council on the History of Medicine "The reader will be surprised to learn how the SS and other Nazi Party leaders came to know the medical knowledge they needed to exterminate so many people in such a short time. The authors show how these leading Nazis were able to make the most difficult technological advances of the war and to implement them with remarkable precision. They report on the efforts of a variety of scientists and medical personnel to create new lethal products, including the chemical gas Zyklon-B, the lethal insecticide DDT and the lethal pesticide Dipel." -- Stephen Biddle, The Journal of Biomedical History "A powerful and frightening book, which, unfortunately, is rarely read in English. With the help of an impressive list of primary documents and dozens of photographs and personal testimonies, the authors bring this history to life. This book is a necessary and timely reminder that in the face of atrocity after atrocity, the world should not forget or forgive those who committed the horrors. The Nazis knew how to kill but it took the world years
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was surprised that so many of my peers and I had not been exposed to the true and terrifying legacy of the Nazis in Germany.   This book is just fantastic    - it makes me want to run to the library and pull out the original Nazi-era encyclopedias. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this is the best introduction to economics I've ever read.  I'm in my early thirties, but had never studied economics prior to reading this book.  It's just a joy to read. If only it were more popular!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book after having been a Jehovah's Witness for 30 years.   It explains all the doctrinal inconsistencies and how those are not important.  It's all about what is really important: love and acceptance. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book on the evolution of the human mind. It's a very well written book, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in science, especially those interested in the cognitive and behavioral aspects of evolution. I'm glad that I picked it up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book because I was looking for a good introduction to the concept of a post-scarcity society. This one did a pretty good job of it, not as good as the last book I read about the topic (which also covered the subject very well), but still good.  The book itself is well written and contains some good information.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of Stephen King and his other works. This book was a joy to read.   King and the author are good friends and both are well known authors of horror.  The characters were so well developed and interesting.  King gave these characters a sense of life and emotions they usually don't get to experience.  I have a hard time putting down a good story, especially one about a crazy kid and his big scary monster! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful read for all levels of students.  I love how she takes a look at the historical impact of gender on the educational systems in America.  She has a lot of fun doing it.   I recommend it to anyone interested in the ways in which the gender and race of a student impacts how that student is perceived and treated by the education system. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first part is a classic work of philosophy on how to think. It's one of the first books I've read on the topic of rational thought. It covers a lot of ground - from the nature of rational thinking to how we can learn from our mistakes, and how to avoid those mistakes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  I used to be very cynical about most things, and I thought most religious books were just an expression of that.  This book has a different outlook and is much more uplifting.  It's very simple to understand, but a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides clear, comprehensive information about many issues in American life, in particular: the growth of inequality in our society, our current political and economic systems, the relationship between religion and politics, and how these systems affect both individual lives and the economy at large.  In addition, there is much about contemporary American religion that is interesting and insightful, including: the growing prominence of a "New Protestantism"; the recent decline of religion in America; the rising prevalence of "Nones"; the emergence of new religious groups in America such as agnostics and atheists; and the impact of American culture on the nature of religion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really impressed by this book, and the quality of the writing is fantastic.  It was great to read someone who knew about the history of these issues, but had never thought about it in quite so much depth.  I'd never been so convinced that the book was the right one for me! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a copy of A Natural History of Hell (2003), which I've enjoyed many times. I had a hard time keeping up with the story. It's a very short book but the writing was so good, I kept going back for more. The book is interesting, informative and thought provoking.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the Bible.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been on an amazing journey through The Unofficial Guide to Atheism, which has been a valuable source of information in many ways. The authors are brilliant, and have done an amazing job of making their information accessible.  They have been able to do so in a way that gives the readers a more direct access to what they think is important.  It is a good resource for anyone who is trying to figure out what to believe. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the second book I have read by the famous American novelist Ralph Ellison.  This time I was not disappointed:  Ellison's prose is clean, his characters are sympathetic, and his themes are intriguing.  The main point, as always, is to reveal the human side of things that are seen in the abstract.  For a novel about the search for identity and the loss of faith, this was a timely and moving story.  I think Ellison would have approved of the final chapter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In my opinion, this is the best book on the Christian right. It makes it clear that the fundamental Christian right is fundamentally anti-feminist and anti-gay, and they go further than just not recognizing gay people as human beings. They go so far as to support discrimination against gays. If you support this ideology you have absolutely no business teaching kids about the Bible. This book will be required reading for anyone involved with this movement.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The language is extremely vivid: the descriptions, the images, the emotions are just so real and so perfect I could feel them in my bones.  It's just impossible to describe in words how much I enjoyed reading this.  The ending was so satisfying, I had to keep rereading to see if the characters survived and found the love of their lives.  If you like this sort of book, you will love this one!
Write a positive review about a good book:   In "The Gilded Age: The Rise and Fall of an American Empire", Michael Wolff describes the reign of Andrew Carnegie in the first half of the nineteenth century as "a century of the worst poverty and the worst wealth inequality in history." For more than half a century after he died, Carnegie was able to build on his empire by extending his family's control over vast areas of the American economy. At the same time, however, many American workers suffered from the Great Depression. How did Carnegie, the architect of a system of exploitation, remain popular? One of the most persuasive arguments of "The Gold Standard" is the historian's argument that the rise of the trusts was driven by greed for money, not by any concern for the common good. In the end, the trusts had to be broken up. Yet we never hear the story of how the trusts were allowed to go on for so long.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have just started reading the "The Book of Mormon," and I'm already very impressed. The book's primary author, Richard Bushman, is a Mormon scholar, and as such, the text reads very well. This makes for a nice introduction, even if the overall substance of the book is not quite up to par.  I enjoyed many of Bushman's other works as well, so I'm confident that the Mormon material will also be good.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for beginning writers. It has a real sense of "what works" and what doesn't.   I like that it doesn't spend a whole lot of time discussing "how to do it right" but rather just lets writers do it their way.  The structure is very efficient and there is a lot of useful material in it.  If you are in the beginning stages of trying to write a book or novel, you might find this book a good way to get started.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was excellent for those that like history, but also for those who have never had a college education.  The focus of the book is on early American history, from the pre-colonial era to the 19th century.  I enjoyed learning about some of the people and events covered in this book.  Also, the author included an appendix with many interesting, insightful historical documents and quotes from historical figures.  Finally, the book included a bibliography and a map.   I would recommend this book to anyone, regardless of their age. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about the Holocaust, but is so much more. I have never heard about the concentration camps until I saw this film and was overwhelmed. This is an incredibly detailed and well-researched book. I don't know how anyone could not want to read it and live out the atrocities that happened here. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is well written. A good story told well. I would recommend this book to students who love history, and especially to students of religion.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful novel, full of life, humor and drama.  The characters are fascinating, well developed and complex.   The plot is exciting, moving and believable.  I can't wait to get started on this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're a fan of science fiction or fantasy, you'll probably find something interesting in this book. I'm a long time fan of the space opera genre, so I was pleasantly surprised by the author's attention to detail. In fact, the characters in this novel are so well designed and presented that I wish I'd bought the print version.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! I think my favourite thing about it is the fact that the author has a child in the group, and is trying to encourage that child to be open-minded about gender.   It was a real eye-opener for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was recently diagnosed with severe depression after a divorce.  For the past 4 months I have been trying to get better.  I had read so many books and videos about how to get out of depression.  As usual, the solutions were "well, do this or that," but I never found them to be effective.  Then I found a book by John C. Wright called: "The Science of Low Mood."  He was able to get himself out of what had been a deep depression by implementing a new habit, writing in a journal every day.  After reading "The Nature of Madness" in an attempt to improve my mood, I realized how much I was still suffering from depression and found "The Scientist" by John Locke to be the most useful of all.   In this book Locke explains that the brain is made up of "the nervous, respiratory, and circulatory systems" that work together to produce the mood you experience.  It is the combination of all these systems that cause your mood to be "the mind's response to the world."  For me, "The Mechanic of Morals" by the Swedish psychiatrist Hans Eysenck was the most helpful.  He explained how the mind can be very simple, very rigid, but nonetheless can be influenced by the environment in ways that make it behave in a different way than the environment alone would predict.  By understanding this, you will not be surprised when you are presented with a different reality than the one you thought existed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first of many to come from the new Starz series "A Song of Ice and Fire." This book takes place immediately following the TV show "Game of Thrones," which is quite a departure from the novels and therefore makes this book feel a bit "off." This is the second of the three books I've read about George R. R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice, and it's the only one I'm disappointed in.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a lot of books about the assassination and I have always found the evidence to be questionable and even suspect. But this book really blew me away.   The best part was that they went so far as to show how the President was actually wounded and that the bullet was almost certainly from a different gun.  It made the whole thing seem more plausible.  If you're looking for a good read with some interesting facts about this important part of American history, you really can't go wrong with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book for the first time two years ago and was absolutely blown away. It took me a few months to really read the text and appreciate it, but I finally did. I liked the way he treated the idea of time in his book and how much he thought about how much time he takes in his life. The chapters were short and succinct so that I could learn as much as I could without having to reread the same information over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book on parenting and children I've ever read. I loved this book so much that I re-read it this spring.  I read this book the night before bed as a way to sleep.  The first five pages (I think) are a series of quotes from important authors about having children.  And then it turns to the point of this book.  It's a little bit preachy, but that's okay.   When the book gets to the end, it explains what the author believes is right about raising children.Â  Â It's based on her own experiences raising three daughters.Â  I'm not religious, and this book had me thinking about why we do the things we do. Â And I really liked the chapter on marriage, which I found to be pretty well written and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you want to know about the history of the British Empire from the start, then this is the book for you.   The author makes a very good case that Britain's rise in power and wealth were both caused by European imperial expansion and that the Empire had to be ended to save European interests.  He argues that colonialism was only one of many factors that led to Britain's eventual economic and political decline.  While he is very critical of the various European empires that succeeded the British, and he admits to being biased, he is absolutely correct about their disastrous impact on the peoples of Europe and elsewhere.  The Empire's economic failure and its military overreach is a major reason why the British eventually lost their empire, and one of the main reasons for the end of their rule.  As for the political collapse, he makes a convincing case that British rule in India was inimical to Indian nationalism and led to the growth of Pakistan.  Even if one does not buy into this thesis, he still makes a good case, and there is little question that Britain would be just as bad off today as India was with British rule.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I didn't like it at first, but after I gave it a chance I realized it is an excellent study of the evolution of the Roman Empire. The book gives a clear and concise picture of the cultural influences which brought about a new "Roman" Empire. While the authors are careful to avoid any kind of romanticism, they are also careful not to portray the Romans in a negative light.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading The Great Gatsby. The book is divided into two sections. Part 1 is about Gats and Part 2 is about Daisy.  Part 1 introduces Gats who is the primary protagonist of the book and gives us a taste of his life as he tries to fit in and find his place in the world. Part 2 gives us the other half of Gats' life as Daisy. Daisy is the secondary protagonist and shares much the same life and experiences. I found that part 2 made the story better. I liked the part where Daisy was told that her father would like a new baby. I thought it was a great idea and it was well written. It also explained the fact that Daisy had a lot of money while Gats had very little and that helped her make the decision to stay in New York. I also found that I really appreciated the fact the book gave us Daisy's life story at different ages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must-read book for anyone who cares about global warming, particularly Americans and Canadians. The book lays out a plausible path to saving the planet, and in my view, it's a more realistic approach to global warming than that offered by Al Gore, whose movie, An Inconvenient Truth, is full of inaccuracies and omissions. The title "Citizen-Earth" is particularly appropriate: 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The problem with modern psychiatry, as I see it, is that the old model is just too much fun to pass up."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book as a non-fiction introduction to the theory and practice of the "fuzzy logic" approach to mathematics. The author is not an expert in the subject, but has a keen eye for the "unreasonable" that can arise from such work. The book is not for mathematicians but for anyone interested in this area, and as such covers an interesting variety of interesting topics. For instance, the chapter "Unreasonable Proofs" covers both the standard and the "Fuzzy Logic" approaches to proving an algebraic property. I enjoyed a lot of the material that was presented and learned a lot in the process.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  I have a B.A. in English and Literature, and have spent my career as a teacher. I thought the lessons learned in this book were relevant to a wide range of subjects. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really entertaining book.   The humor and action make this a quick read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A novel of the most unique, unusual and brilliant characters I've ever read in the genre.  This is a wonderfully written story, one of the best that I've read in some time.  It takes the form of a diary that follows the lives of a group of women as they experience life in the city.  There is no 'plot' in this book but instead a series of events that are related, and often in a way that is extremely poignant.  If you're a fan of female protagonists who are very intelligent and are usually quite self-confident, this is a story for you.  The book also has a lot of great quotes from the women in the book as well, which are very humorous.  I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very interesting and a good place to start reading about the Holocaust.   The book is written by an Orthodox Jewish woman.  This made me a little nervous, but I was glad I did.  There is a lot of good information in this book about the treatment of Jews in various countries.  Also, there is a good amount of history about the use of force by Jews to try to protect their religion and community.  I think the best parts of the book are the personal accounts of the people who were affected by the Holocaust and the information that they gave about their experiences.  For the most part, it is not all that difficult to get through the book.  If you want to know more about the holocaust, I would suggest reading " The Day of the Locust " 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book because my husband had read it and loved it.   The book is a good resource for getting the most out of your yoga practice, and includes exercises that you can practice at home.  The yoga teacher she interviewed also gave me tips and pointers on how to improve my stretching technique. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book helpful in understanding the process of writing a good novel. The author does a great job in conveying her experience in writing a book, and the book gives readers a useful toolkit to begin their writing career. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in writing novels.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book as much as it made me laugh. I love funny books but I've never been a big fan of the same old stories. The best book I've ever read about traveling is a funny travel book: the original "Travels with Charley." The author of the book has traveled in many countries and has stories about almost every single one. It's a hilarious read. The story of Charley is a very similar one, though less serious. I think it's because the book is a travel diary. There is also a joke about traveling on the way to work every morning: When you board the plane to go to work, you check the luggage first, then you check your suitcases. You check your shoes. Then you check everything else. You can't put everything in your suitcase! In this case, the book might be a little better if the stories weren't about traveling for a book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had been looking forward to this book for a while and finally bought it in paperback last night.  The book is beautifully illustrated and contains information that most Americans could use at some point.  It also provides examples of some of the "isms" that come up in conversation, like "What the (expletive) is wrong with you?!"  I was surprised to learn that the "ism" I'd been hearing since childhood was considered the most normal one, and that it had its roots in the 19th century when white people were considered "unclean" and people of color were considered inferior.  Also, as the "ist" suggests, the book does contain the occasional historical joke, which is refreshing in an otherwise serious book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had high hopes for this book and I'm sorry to say I wasn't so sure at the outset.   However, I read it in less than two days after receiving it.  The first chapter was the most helpful in my opinion.  My problem was that I was just starting a journey to develop a more spiritual life, so I was confused about the concept of spirituality and how it relates to religion.  But the author answered my questions immediately.  In the next chapter she explained the idea of "the cycle of rebirth."  She says that "we are born to this life and then we live in it and then die, a cycle which repeats over and over again."  But after reading about the Buddhist teaching of  nirvana (the extinction of all  attachments) and about how the Buddha is in nirvanic consciousness (in the state of nirvÄá¹a) in every moment,  I found my path to spiritual awakening.  I'm glad I read this book before I embarked on my own spiritual journey.  It wasn't easy to start reading this book at first, but it's not too late. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a few nonfiction books about the Holocaust, but I can't say that I've ever been able to relate to them.   This book by a survivor has made me change my tune.  It is very informative.  I think I have a better understanding of my parents' beliefs and the attitudes they brought to the table for their family.  They did make mistakes, but they were a lot better people than I had ever imagined.  A great book about a great person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I found myself reading the book, I was so interested in its themes. I was even interested in learning how to read.   The book's themes are based on a philosophy of life known as Objectivism.  It's a way of life that holds that everything in life is subjective and must be treated that way.  Objectivism holds that life is made up of two parts: 1. A person's life, which is a series of events over which he or she has some control. 2. The world, which consists of everything that is outside his or her control, including society.  If this sounds like your kind of thing, read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I've read by an American that has any relevance to my own life.  This book gives some good advice on the kind of life you should choose for yourself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a long time fan of Huxley's work, I was delighted to see him making a reference to his great, and still very much relevant, novel, Brave New World, in the opening chapter.  Although it was the first time in any of his works that he had made reference to a specific book, it is a classic of science fiction, which I have long considered one of the most important of all genre's.  Huxleys work has always been fascinating.  I look forward to many more of his writings in the future 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently read "The Secret Life of Bees," by the famous entomologist Charles A. Calvert, Jr.  It was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm glad I did.  Calvert is not just the most famous entomsologist of all time, he is an excellent writer as well.  The book covers all kinds of interesting topics, including the fascinating life and work of Queen Elizabeth the Queen of England.  I was fascinated by the story of her use of the British Royal Family as an entomological breeding station.  And I was especially interested in the ways in which entomologists can become involved in important historical events, such as the rise of the American Revolution.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I tried this book I was very excited to read it.  I had been trying to find a book that would help me learn how to write a good story, and this one just fit the bill.  For the most part it was straightforward instructions and examples, but I did learn a few useful techniques that I use today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book! This is a wonderful, practical guide for learning the art and science of writing. You won't find a more helpful book on the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Taken together, The World Only Spins Forward and This Unruly Mess I've Made are a remarkable collection of essays and interviews that tell a story that's as inspiring as it is embarrassing: how one writer and his family's personal and political struggles led him to confront, and then confront hard, what he had been taught to believe about the human condition. " --John McPhee, author of The Good Life: How to Make Good Decisions for Good Times
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of excellent information and fascinating historical information about the Roman world.  The author's background is in medieval literature and history and she provides an excellent explanation of how this influence has been felt in modern history.  Her research is especially interesting, as she examines the influence of medieval scholarship on the founding of modern universities and explains the impact that the Renaissance has had on modern science, literature, and literature in general.  I particularly liked her treatment of the influence that Italian Renaissance scholarship had on the writings of Christian philosophers such as Plotinus, Augustine, and Aquinas, as well as on Christian theology and art.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book last week and I am glad I did! It is an excellent book on the subject of why people cheat. The author has a masterful way of making his points by showing you how to be successful with it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really good!   I was born in 1972 and read this book in college.  I loved it so much that when I got to grad school I read it over and over again.   It's like one of those old-timey books that you've always wanted to read, but never had the money to.  It explains how God was in the Bible all along!  It has been written in a very easy-to-understand style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, Dr. David Gorski, a cardiologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, argues that dietary saturated fat is one of the greatest dangers to health today. He writes, "Overweight and obesity are a growing public health threat. Saturated fat, found in meat, dairy products, and eggs, has been identified as a major culprit in the rising prevalence of the condition." I've known Dr. Gorski since 1993 and I've always been impressed with his writing style. I particularly like his use of anecdotes to illustrate his claims. It's a lot of fun to read and I'm sure it will provide many new insights about diet and health.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure I'll ever be the same.  I've been following the works of Susan B. Anthony for almost as long as I've listened to the Grateful Dead.  When I first read The True Confessions of Susan Anthony, the only thing I could think of was to go back and reread the first five books of the series. The truth about what actually happened in those moments when she lost her life to the medical profession, however, is as startling as any novel written about the subject, and just as profound.  It's about a woman who's been denied the opportunity to have her own life as she wishes, and whose death is blamed on the doctor who refused to honor that choice.  While the book is not an accurate portrayal of the life of Susan, it's a very honest look at what a woman does when she's denied her desires.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The premise is interesting and it does the job of bringing the author's expertise to the forefront: the way that the American media is used to sell a war is a good example. As for the substance, the author does an excellent job describing how these military operations actually take place and how they can become counterproductive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very impressed with this book. It's very well written, well-researched, and the illustrations are excellent. As an adult I've never been much of a fan of children's books and this one was especially interesting to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R Tolkien. I've heard about this book for some time, but I couldn't seem to find a copy. My kids were into this book, but not Tolkien, so I never got around to reading it myself. I did, however, like the story of Frodo and the ring. It's a great read for the kids, and the plot is interesting, as is the world and the characters. I'm looking forward to finishing it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first chapter is excellent. I have heard a few good things about Dr. David L. Gelles, but I wanted to hear his side of the story. His book is well-written and has a good overview.
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you enjoy historical fiction, you'll enjoy this one as well.  The story is based on an actual historical event that happened during World War II, which is why the narrator (John K. McEwen) makes it sound like it happened in the actual 1940s.  McEwan does a fantastic job of blending historical details with contemporary stories of the time, like the life of a famous author.  You can tell that McEwin is well versed in both the history and the characters.  I can see that there's more to the story than the title suggests, and I'm eager to read the rest of the book to see what else the author has in store for me.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was looking for a book about people with Asperger's syndrome and autism.  This one has it all: interesting history of the condition, interesting perspectives on the condition.  If I had autism, it would have been in the seventh grade at school.  I'm a person of color who is highly attuned to color and sounds and smells and has excellent attention to details.  But I don't read a lot of books.  The person I'm with in the book, who is on the spectrum too, is a reader.  She finds this interesting because she and her brother had a very similar developmental curve in their development. Â   In addition to interesting perspectives and perspectives on what it is to be autistic, the writing is well done and full of ideas and interesting details. I think this would make a good addition to your library.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best science book I've ever read.   There's more to the natural world than what you get from the textbook.  I was impressed by the amount of information and the variety of topics covered.  There are also some very interesting anecdotes.  The authors show great attention to detail and do a great job of outlining their sources, especially the great work that's been done by Dr. Thomas Hunt Morgan.  They're not afraid to lay it out in the form of a table or diagram.  It makes the information crystal clear and easy to understand.  If you're going to write a book on anything, you might as well write about physics and the great thinkers who have contributed to our knowledge of nature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's just not a fun story to read. The writing is not great but it's not bad, either. The characters aren't very memorable, and the plot is pretty weak. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't think I'd call this a memoir, but it's a fascinating look at the creative process. The authors do a great job of making the story come alive and the writing is strong, entertaining, and full of wit. I thought I'd read something about the process of coming up with the title for a novel when I don 't think I have a book idea at the moment. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In the process of writing this book, I have realized that there is no single way of doing a good historical novel. No matter how great or terrible, a novel has to deal with historical events, people and situations in a way that allows for an exciting reading experience. I find that a great deal of historical fiction relies on either an obvious lack of historical knowledge or a very biased historical perspective. If the former, the historical account becomes "so bad, it's good," if the latter, it can become a kind of glorified biography. Either way, the results are usually not very good. This is not my experience with, say, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe: A Novel. I am extremely skeptical about whether or not Crusoe ever lived (he did not, although he did come close), but I have never been troubled by its historical accuracy. That Crusoe had two wives and eleven children is a pretty well-known fact in historical fiction. In this book however, the fact that the author (John B. Palfrey) is the son of the late historian (and former governor of Texas) William E. P. Pufahl (who also wrote the aforementioned "Robinson Crusoe" book) is completely glossed over. Piefahl was well-liked by historians as well as historians' wives. He was not only a highly respected and accomplished historian, he was also the husband of the first female secretary of the state of Texas, Julia H. Piff. The result is that the book is a very one-sided view of history. In addition to its lack of objective historical knowledge, the book suffers from a very narrow and biased political perspective. Prentice is a right-wing Republican with a strong evangelical Christian worldview. His primary concern is that liberalism and diversity threaten the conservative Christian values he has found to be so appealing. This viewpoint was very similar to that of the "religious right" at the time. That this book will be published by a very conservative publishing house should not be surprising.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book! It's a fun, light read about a "real-life" man who goes to a conference where "magic" is discussed. After a bit, I found out that magic is actually quite common, and there are plenty of ways to become better at it (like using the "one percent rule"). Even so, "One Man's Magic" is a very funny book about how a real-life man is convinced that a magic spell can solve all his problems. In addition, the author tells a pretty funny story about a woman who thinks she is pregnant with her husband's child.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really good. I've had a lot of interest in it, but I didn't get it until after I read a lot.  It is an interesting study of human nature, and I liked that it is based on psychological theory (rather than mere data on human behavior). I'm glad I finally got it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was my first non-fiction book. I was skeptical about reading a memoir but I liked it and I'm glad I did. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has inspired me to look into different ways of creating a book, and I think this one is my favorite.  I've been reading lots of "write to order" books about writing, and many of them are pretty bad. This one is different. It's a mix of good advice and bad, and it's all in the writing and the formatting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book, and enjoyed it. It's funny, well written and very well organized.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It is an explanation of the philosophy of life and the world. It includes some interesting details of Buddhist philosophy. The book is written by a non-Buddhist man. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the perfect antidote for an unappreciative student, one who feels as if he or she does not deserve a great education. He or she is angry about not receiving the credit for their work, but the writer shows them how a true education is a two-way street, with each individual contributing as much to the outcome as the other. A well-rounded student who makes great contributions will never be told that his or her effort is unimportant.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a superb book on the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). It is, at its core, an exposition of the work done by the Soviet-era Communist Party's Central Committee, especially by its second secretary, Aleksey Kosygin, in the period following Stalin's death. This book is an important book because Kosykin's work was essential to the building of the CPSU after the death of the second Soviet leader, and it is only through his work that the Russian Revolution is known as the Bolshevik Revolution. If only American textbooks on the Soviet period had been able to include Kosykyin in their works in the 1950s and 1960s, the world might have been spared years of American Cold War triumphalism.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first in theÂ Â Gladwell trilogy.   It describes a world in which things are different:  The world is filled with great thinkers. Â  Everyone has a great idea, everyone has a brilliant way of talking.  The difference is that they don't act on the ideas,  but leave the ideas alone to develop in the world.  People live long lives and haveÂ betterÂ health and less crime.  This is the world we live in now.  Gladwell describes the world asÂ precious.  It's full of wonder.  Everyone can have a chance at something.  Everything is interconnected.  Good people get good jobs, and bad people get bad jobs.  We have to learn to work together to get the world to work for us.  And you're never the victim, you're the cause.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was very good. I loved the plot - it's the story that's the trouble - but also the characters and the world they created.  The world is rich and varied; you can find yourself at various points in the book in a different place, time, and with different people.  It really is like a different world.  A wonderful book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book when I was looking for a good horror novel. It was definitely a good read. I think it's a good idea to have a list of recommended horror stories when a friend, or a stranger on the subway asks you a question about a favorite movie or book.  It has been great to hear others enjoy it as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm glad I finally read this book after so many years! I've read a lot of books in my time, but this one was particularly enjoyable.   While it does delve into the history of mental illness and the medicalization of people with mental illness, it does so in a way that is so accessible, so honest, and so refreshing, it makes me want to read the book all over again.  It shows how important being open and honest is to a person who has experienced a mental health issue and how it can be an important part of recovery.  The book also contains many useful tips for those who may be experiencing mental illness in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book, and I am happy to have found it! I loved the story of how the father of my current boyfriend, a Marine, came across the book and read it. He really wanted me to read it, and now that I have, he is convinced that the book is a true story. I'll admit that I was hesitant about buying it, as I found it rather tedious and had trouble following the story. But the author did an excellent job of explaining the story in a manner that is easy to understand. She also provides interesting background information about what motivated the soldiers to take part, and why they chose to go against their commanders.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "A fascinating journey into the inner workings of the human brain."   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book because I am a professional speaker and thought it would be good for people who want to be prepared for a professional speaking job.   It's interesting and not at all dry.  If you want to do a lot of speaking, I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book   It is very good, well researched, and full of useful information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The premise behind this book: "I am a heterosexual woman and my husband is a homosexual. I have always thought I knew what it meant to be a lesbian. I thought I was born that way, but I now know that is not true. My husband is different. He is more of a man than I am, more aggressive and dominant."   A lot of people have a problem with this premise. They may think that a woman who wants to have sex with another woman is a contradiction of her own identity. They think a woman like that is a "bad lesbian". However, what the author does is to point out that heterosexual women are also attracted to men, and men are attracted to women. Men who want to have anal sex with women are not "bad lesbians" but women who are attracted only to women are. Men are just as much heterosexual women's husbands as women are their boyfriends. I also like that she discusses female friendships with other women and why that matters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my first foray into the field of non-fiction, and this book provides an excellent foundation.   Although it is not the first book I have read on this topic, it is the first to include a lot of very positive material. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't know what it is about this book that I love so much but it is amazing!   The first five pages are the best, and I'm definitely going to be picking up the rest.   This is probably the best book on philosophy in a long time, and it makes a strong case for why the word "philosophy" has gone from having something to do with the mind to being a separate, but useful, discipline. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read this book, I thought it was great. I'd heard that it had been an academic favorite, and I thought I'd found the perfect book to bring to the university library. But it wasn't just that.  It was also so much more.  This book was written with the utmost sincerity  and care.  Each chapter is written with a sense of  humility, not wanting to be so pretentious as to sound pretentious, and this is the right way to go.  The book is so honest and so sincere that it can be a bit irritating.  But it is never insincere, and it is certainly a joy to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a very good introduction to Christian history.  I am in the process of writing my graduate thesis on early Christianity and am having a hard time finding the time to read books.  This one is so very much shorter and concise that I am very glad I picked it up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought this book was wonderful! I am a college student with a major in psychology and I was looking for more information on the brain and what it can and cannot do. It's so obvious that our brains are hardwired to do certain things. I have always thought that when it comes to emotions and behavior, we have no control over it.  I have learned, however, that we can take control over our emotions, and that we should try to.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. As I have found out about the research of women and men on their differences, I have come to realize that there are indeed certain similarities between the sexes. I have yet to find a book that actually explains these similarities. This book does so in a very simple and easy to understand manner, without being condescending.   It also has a nice balance of anecdotes from both men and women, in a way that allows the women to shine, while giving the men plenty of space to talk. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been searching for a good work of fiction with the kind of realistic and non-bloated style that makes a good story 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Gives you a feeling of what life is really like, and what you are like if you're not on a real motorcycle. A true adventure"   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been trying to get some of my husband's old stories into print for a long time, and this book is definitely worth it. The stories are well-told, the writing is clear, and I was able to connect with the characters through the story's emotional resonance. I have the feeling that I am going to continue reading the book and finding new stories to love.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in 2005. It is a history of the modern American West, which I greatly enjoyed. The story of the formation of the West is often presented in books as being the product of a single individual, such as Theodore Roosevelt, but this is not true. It was the work of many individuals. The people who established the West were also pioneers in their own right, although their work did not lead them to the West. Theodore Roosevelt was the first person to call it the West, in his book "Pioneer West." He also wrote of the pioneers in the West as being in direct competition with Native Americans. They faced a constant struggle for control of the new land. When they did establish the West they did so by force. The settlers faced many challenges, such not only from the Native Americans but also from the United States government. Roosevelt also wrote, "The new settlers were not well represented in Congress."
Write a positive review about a good book:   The The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: A Simple Plan to Transform Your Home, Get Organized, and Get Your Life Back On Track is a simple and powerful book that is easy to follow.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not the biggest fan of this book when I first read it. In fact, I put it down after a couple of chapters. Then, the more I read it, the better I felt. I found it very informative, well-researched, and well-written. It is certainly not the most "hip" book to read (for the most part). However, I think that many people may find it useful. It does not include all of the technical details that many books have. However, the information that it does have is very good. It covers some things that a layperson would not understand, such as the "Rhodes code" that is used to encrypt and decrypt communications. It also covers some of the more common encryption systems and passwords that have been created over the years. For example, it is very difficult to memorize passwords that are very long, and the passwords that were used in the book are very strong. They are often difficult to remember even for the original password creator. It would have been very helpful for me to have read this book prior to trying to learn how to secure my phone, laptop, and email. This book can help you understand these common systems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read: It's hard to pick a favorite in a book like this; a lot of them are good but some of the writing is atrocious. But as far as historical fiction goes, this is the one I can give the most high marks for. It's an engaging story with a wide variety of characters and locations. The writing is not flawless; occasionally it's too fast or too precise, but it's definitely good. The best part of the book is that the narrator is very believable and a likable one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Good Earth is one of my favorite works of science fiction.   Written in 1977, the book takes place on the planet of Gaia, a biosphere on which the sun, moon, and stars act as a giant thermostat, regulating the temperature at every degree of Earth's surface.  Gaia's "greenhouse effect" has led the human race to develop the first interstellar ships, and this book gives us a tour of the new technology that has been developed to explore these strange new worlds.  The story is one that has resonated with me ever since I read it.  While it takes place decades after the original book, I still read it every five or so years.  There is never a dull moment in the book, and it keeps you reading until the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters of this novel are rich and varied.  The author did an excellent job of giving us a full picture of their lives and of the times in which they lived, in which their characters have grown and changed.  They all have their good and their bad points, and the author did a nice job of writing about those.  I liked that he wrote them as though they were still alive and could recall what their lives were like at the time of writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am reading this book in preparation for the SAT, and I am learning a lot of new concepts about writing. I found myself asking a lot more questions than usual (not just because of my need for a quick review, but also because of the novelty). I was pleased to see a number of questions that had already been asked in the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite book in this genre is David Grossman's The Power of Nightmares.  Grossman has an incredible imagination, a brilliant understanding of human psychology, and a knack for writing good horror, which is a rare thing.  This book is so compelling and full of creepy scenes that I kept on flipping the pages, not wanting to put it down.  The illustrations are especially cool.  I was reminded of my trip to Mexico's National Museum, which also features strange illustrations.  And Grossman takes his research seriously, making sure to include all the facts, statistics, and sources needed to inform his readers.  Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't normally read fiction, but this one caught my attention.  The theme of "dying and coming back" is interesting to me, but I wonder how it is used in this particular story.  I like the premise, and it seems plausible enough to be believable.  It doesn't stop me from wanting more information on the subject, though, so I will have to read some other books that deal with the same theme to see if it was a missed opportunity.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. There are a number of interesting ideas and observations in the book, and it is clear that her goal is not to promote the importance of women as leaders (though she does note the importance), but rather to provide women with some useful tools for leadership. Her approach is not exclusively "woman's wisdom."  She describes a number women who have been successful at leadership positions within a variety of situations.  It is nice to see a book that doesn't use a checklist or a formula to help women achieve leadership positions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful. It's not quite as good as  A Book for Mortals  by David Foster Wallace, but it's still wonderful.  There is something about the way this book is written that feels like it could easily be a movie script.  It feels very cinematic and not like a biography.  The writing style is smooth and smooth.  For the most part, the author just keeps talking and talking until the next paragraph says, "See? It happens again."  If you have ever read Wallace's short stories, you can feel Wallace's voice coming through in the story as well.  In this book, the voice is completely unique and is really fun to listen to.  I'm not sure if this is true of all books like this, but this one was so easy to get into.  You never get to the good parts, which I think is a bad thing, but there are a few good ones.  If it were easy to read it would be a good thing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book for those who have a keen interest in the history and psychology of the Holocaust. The book is written with the utmost authority and with great insight. It is full of well-researched, well-documented information about the Holocaust, both from historians and people who lived it. The author also draws an interesting parallel between the two events and his explanation of why they are similar. He also goes into detail about the psychological effects of the holocaust and shows how the survivors are able to cope in their modern society. This book is an excellent resource for both students and non-students of history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only negative thing I can say about this book is that there is a little bit of bad language in the book.  But it was not very bad and I think it worked in the characters development.  The best thing about this novel was the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be a very interesting and informative history book about the lives of women's suffragists and their contributions to the advancement of women. It covers a great deal of ground, including a number of things that I didn't know and some things that shocked me, such as the fact that women did not have the right to vote until 1920. The history is very interesting but a little repetitive. Also, I think some of the stories about women in Congress were misleading (e.g. the case of Alice Paul), but this seems to be common practice in history writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was quite hesitant to start reading this book because it was written in the    early   days   of the Iraq War. The writing style was rather   amateurish,   and I was concerned that it would make the story too   simplistic.  I had my reservations, but I was also   interested to see the perspective of an intelligence analyst who has a different perspective on   events than I did. He gave an   overall view of why the war was launched, but   he also provided a more   complex picture of events. He also  reminded me  that most of the intelligence assessments that were issued in the lead up to   the Iraq invasion were "not very good," and were based upon a   rather superficial review of the information. This has been   a recurring problem with some of the analysts  who have written on the war. It   bothered me that they  didn't look more closely at the intelligence. I think this book   will make the events in Iraq more complicated and will be  useful to people who have questions about how the events transpired.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My first attempt at reading one of David Foster Wallace's novels was a terrible disappointment.  While this isn't an essential read, I recommend it for fans of his work and those new to it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. It is an account of how the rise of women in business started in an Eastern country that is now a huge industrialized power. The author is a well-regarded economics professor at UCLA. She has lived in China for decades and has interviewed many women and their daughters and granddaughters who have become wealthy by setting up shop there.   The women in the book are smart and accomplished.  Their story is so compelling that I read the first few chapters in a single day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great.  As someone who has lived in several countries, I know it can be difficult to adjust to the culture of another.  However, by following these steps, you will be able to quickly get used to the habits, customs and language of any new country or region.  Although this book does not teach you how to speak a foreign language, it does show you how not to speak it.  I've already found a few useful phrases and expressions, and I plan to try out the other techniques in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am in my third grade class this year. The book has been the most important part of the curriculum, and my students really take to it.  It is a great story, full of wonder and fun and good lessons, and really takes me away from the negative thoughts and negative events of the day, and reminds me of how lucky I am to have a life of such joy and freedom.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a great read, even though the story was rather predictable.  It was fun, with the ending being a neat little bonus.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoy this book. It is really well written, and has a lot of good information about various aspects of human nature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read many different books on the subject of race, both in print and on-line. The first one I read on-air was a book I'd heard about but never really paid attention to. Then I read "American Apartheid: The Tragedy of the Apartheid System in the United States." It is the best book I've ever read. It gives a very precise understanding of exactly what the "problem" is, and it is very hard to argue with any of the points he makes. His point of view is clear and concise and well-articulated. His book gives a lot of historical background but doesn't make any sweeping judgments that I found confusing or overly dramatic. The book is more an exploration of the problems of the day, and the people that are responsible. As for his conclusions and his criticisms of the current system, they are not all that surprising. But they are absolutely right in my opinion. In any case, he's one of the few people that really gets what the American system is about, and I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to understand it, even if they don't agree with all his conclusions.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read all the Harry Potter books, and I have to say that this one by Sue Black is my favorite.  Sue Black has a wonderful ability to make a seemingly complex subject come alive with a perfect blend of humor, drama, and fantasy.   The magic in this book is really interesting, and a perfect fit for young adults.  I recommend this to all young readers!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about two very different women, the daughter of a doctor and a young schoolteacher, who both were deeply moved by an experience during a family trip to the mountains. Although both women had been raised in a religious family, it is clear from the descriptions of the two that they were not as rigidly devout as their parents. Neither had been encouraged to do church-related activities. After the trip, the younger woman, who is a Catholic, realized that she wanted to learn more about Christianity. She has had some recent religious experiences which have led her to be very open-minded about other religions, including Buddhism and Islam. The older woman was not initially as open to religion as the younger one, but when she came to understand that this is not a problem for her, she gradually embraced the idea that religious faith is a personal choice. She had no desire to attend church every Sunday. After having some discussions with her parents, she found a way to go, without her parents' knowledge, to church. At first she was upset with herself for not being able to go to church every week, but she found that she could do it on her own. In a very positive way, she had discovered a place where she could meet other people who had also been able to "choose" to attend and worship with them. Both women had a profound change of heart and found that their religious convictions did not impede their ability to live and love as people of faith and in the midst of other people of different beliefs and backgrounds. These experiences demonstrate how one's spiritual life may not always be dictated by one's religious beliefs.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only book I have read by Susan Sontag that I was not disappointed by. I read her early work, and her first book, while not entirely successful, I found insightful and even moving. I have recently read her new book, and have enjoyed it as well. She does not just criticize the culture of the late sixties and seventies, she also writes about her own time and the culture it created. I was particularly struck by her descriptions of the hippie culture's impact on the family and the development of its own form of spirituality. I also found her book about the sexual revolution, on the effect of feminism on marriage and the family, interesting and thought-provoking. For the past forty years, I have been searching for a book that can adequately represent Sontags work in English. This is my search. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have tried a lot of romance books but this one is my favorite. It's about a guy who is in a relationship with a girl who he meets at a party but he gets jealous and decides to break up with her.  This book was written very well and I loved the way the authors portrayed the feelings of the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  It's a great work of fiction about a man who spent twenty years in a mental institution, in the 1960s, because of his homosexuality. He's now happily married with kids and lives a normal, law-abiding life. The ending is a great shock, too.    The book is well-written and engaging, with a great sense of humor and the author's ability to bring a surprising amount of information into the story without making it feel like a "pitch-black" story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have always been a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, and the first book in the series is my favorite. The first two are more of an action-packed adventure, but the third book is a slow, contemplative read. I love it because it allows us to see that despite the best intentions of people, sometimes they make poor decisions that are not necessarily wrong, but just the way they are at the time.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be a great way to introduce many concepts about the history of technology that I have been meaning to understand, and also to teach about different aspects of the history which are important but have not been taught well in popular books. I'm especially interested in the idea that the modern smartphone has a great deal to do with our "digital" lifestyle, and I was also surprised to find how important it was to many early Internet pioneers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters are not unlike your own children at different stages in their lives. They have their ups and downs but are always able to make it through. The author has a way of capturing a small amount of this joy for all of us.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have had a hard time getting into YA in general. I'm sure there are a lot of other people who have experienced the same, but for me it was always a disappointment. I always thought that YA books were supposed to be a positive experience. But this book made me look at that expectation more skeptically and honestly. The characters are interesting, the stories interesting, and the language is refreshingly good. I really enjoyed the dialogue as well. I would totally recommend this book and it would also be a great book for my own library! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in preparation for my first foray into an intensive program. It is a good introduction to the subject. I found the book to be both informative and entertaining.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised by "The End of Work," a book about work and the future that I never knew existed. As a young man, my father worked at the post office. It was his "career" and he was the breadwinner. He told me about his days of working, the hours, the challenges. I found it refreshing to read a non-mystical account of that time, but I wasn't always in the right mindset to take on the challenges that he describes. That said, I found "The Future of Work" enlightening. The book covers the "end of work," but not in a doom-and-gloom way, with some of the most optimistic predictions I've ever seen.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great example of how a woman can look at a man and know how he is feeling and think about it in a new light. This book was given to me as a gift after I had a baby and had to get away from men for awhile.   I was so intrigued that I just had to read it.  The advice was interesting and I can't wait to give it to my son when he comes of age. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was the book I've wanted to read for many years. I'm an old guy, and my generation has mostly forgotten about The Wind in the Willows, the tale of a lonely young boy who discovers a magical book in a cave, where he encounters an unlikely friend and helps him save his village. That book was one of the most important influences on me growing up.  I loved The Windy Willows so much, I had a hard time reading about The Little Mermaid, too.  But this is much more than that.  This is about the importance of stories, how we create and shape our reality. It's about how our imaginations, our sense of the world, and our belief in magic can make the world a much better place.  The Little Princess was an important book for my generation, but this one is even better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have heard of the books of this group before and I was excited to hear about this one.  I've been struggling with this idea of what the body is.   There are many books I've read about this.  But this one is very clear in what it is. It is a body of fluid that you can't really see.  The idea of fluid and blood as one and the same has been around for centuries.  It is also very useful to look at how the body functions.  If you understand the physiology of the heart and lungs, you can understand a lot of body processes.  So much for my own research  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in 2008 and I still find it compelling. Â I've always been interested in the effects of drugs on the brain, especially those used as performance enhancers.    The effects of amphetamine, for instance, have been well documented.  This book focuses on an even more extreme example of such drug use, heroin.  The author writes well, clearly, and with a thorough knowledge of the subject.  He does not sugarcoat the subject, but he is also respectful enough to allow his reader to draw their own conclusions.  I'll admit that I had been skeptical of the drug users I knew as a kid because of their stories of withdrawal, but now I am convinced of the truth of their story.  They had been in withdrawal from heroin long before they were able to get any of their drugs legally. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "We are the 99.9%. If we could save a penny for every time someone said: 'I'd like to join the 1%,' we could spend the day reading, playing, and laughing at books and magazines. That's what books do for me. They are my friends."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read The Great Muppet Caper before and really enjoyed it. I've been wanting to read a book about the Muppets that focuses on the making of Muppet films. This book is a little bit different.  It focuses on various puppeteers, from the ones that worked on the original to those who worked on later films. I can definitely see the writing in this book.  Each puppeteer talks about their favorite scene and why they loved working on the film.  The book also has a lot of great pictures.  I would definitely recommend this book to fans of the Muppet franchise. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised by this book. In fact, I was quite taken with the characters of Mr. Bowers' characters and their problems. I would recommend this book to all who are depressed or have suffered from depression or are in the early stages of a depressive illness.
Write a positive review about a good book:   As someone who has loved reading a lot of the nonfiction that the author has written over the years, this is one of the best. It is not a textbook, and doesn't try to be one. Instead it is a careful and thoughtful exploration of his personal experiences as a Jewish boy and man in the United States during the Second World War. There is so much detail and so much emotion in the book that you feel as if you are the reader. He is extremely clear about his experiences and does not try to sugarcoat or cover them up. He writes in a very matter of fact way that makes you want to go back and reread them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is perfect for anyone who cares about children. It is written in a friendly, positive voice and the book makes a great case for adopting children.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book as much as the first one, and it is not a bad sequel either.  This book is very detailed about how to build and grow a career in the public interest.  It was a lot of fun to read, and I am really excited about being a volunteer for The Equal Voice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not a huge fan of romance but I was definitely interested in this one.  The first half of the book is mostly about our heroines falling for each other but it doesn't slow down for the second half and the characters really come to life.  This was a good romance and if you like romantic books you'll like this one! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you can tolerate my over-the-top style, you'll like this book as much as I did.  It's a humorous look at the history of science and technology. It's not about the scientific breakthroughs themselves (although there are plenty), but more about the culture that nurtures them. It covers a variety of subjects, including the development of the space program, the birth of the nuclear family, and the impact of the Beatles on popular music.  The writing style is extremely dry, with little use of irony and often a heavy dose of sarcasm. I'm definitely going to buy a copy of the sequel, Why We Make the Stuff We Make, if it's ever published. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! It's very easy to understand and you get the most out of it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always been a reader of historical fiction, but I never read one by a woman until the late 1950s. I always found the writing style of Jane Austen's works to be very  antiquated  although, with some exceptions, her novels are full of real, unpretentious love and humor that can't be matched by any of the modern romance novels. This book seems to have something of the same appeal. The setting was interesting enough and the characters were interesting enough but the book failed to live up to my expectations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It has many good and useful observations about modern life, such as the need for more diversity in our world, and the importance of having open and honest discussions about contentious political issues. The author goes on at length about the importance in being kind to oneself, and her advice is very valuable.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of my first day in a college philosophy program was both exciting and nerve-wracking.  I was excited about the opportunity to study a new philosophy, and about the chance to discover a new perspective and apply it to my life.  My fears were about whether I would be able to keep up academically, and whether I'd be able find a job at the end of the first year. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of life and laughs! My 5 year old loves this book, and I can't stop reading it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really surprised by this book. I was afraid that it was going to be another book on the same subject as another one, but this book is very different in that it's really written by a woman, about a different aspect of her own life. It's actually pretty funny, and really well-written, and I think the concept is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in college and really didn't have many favorite authors, so I picked up this book. I really enjoyed it and will definitely be buying more books by her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of historical fiction and this one is very close to my heart.   It is beautifully written and is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! The illustrations are beautiful and the stories are fun. I also liked that there was an element of surprise in some of the stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Book in general. It covers a lot of ground from the beginning to the end.   I've often felt that we can't get too deeply into the Book without being somewhat lost.  I feel the same way about this book.  The information is presented in a logical and organized manner that makes it easy to follow.  It is an excellent introduction to the history of the Book and it makes the book more accessible and interesting.  If you have never read any of the scriptures or the Book, this is the book to read.  This will give you a good feeling about all of the other great things in the scripture and the history.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book so much. My kids loved it too.  The book, which I bought at the local library, is illustrated with drawings and photos. The pictures are nice, but the story is just as good.  I liked the little bits in the book about the family's trips to the zoo, to the beach, and to the amusement park. The illustrations are lovely.  There's a great story in here about the discovery of a lost family heirloom (in this case, a book of family photos).  I enjoyed this one so much that I will buy it again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book. As a young person with autism I always found that when I wanted something to be "cool" I would often try to imitate it, and that I felt the urge to "be cool". The story is very informative, and if you are someone who feels that some things are "too mainstream", you will probably enjoy this book just as much as I did.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was one of my favorite books in middle school.  It told a story that was very important to me as a kid, but has never really been explored.  I learned about an underground Jewish community that ran a museum that was the first to open up to the public in America.  The story has been retold many times, but it never really got down to the nitty gritty.  To me, it was the moral of the story.  My grandfather had worked for a large company, where he was able to take some time off after a tough day and relax at his family's country home in the Catskills.  There he met his first Jewish family.  They lived there for the rest of his life.  That's when they decided to open the museum and they named it after him, which gave my grandfather his last chance to relax and relax, rather than go home to work.  This book tells the entire story. Â  The story of how my grandfather got involved with this community is told in great detail.  One of the great things about this book was that it gave me an opportunity to find out more about the family and what life was like.  In addition, it gave my mother and I the opportunity to see how much work we'd have to put into our families if we wanted them to survive.  Also, this book reminded me of my dad's letter to his friend from prison, where my dad mentioned that the museum was a very difficult time in his life and his family would have died if he didn't come and be part of it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book. I had a lot of fun reading it. I love the way he describes the process of writing poetry. There are lots of interesting things to learn from this. I also enjoyed how he uses the book to develop some more interesting ideas about his own writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I have a Ph.D. in religious studies, and I've done some research on the Bible, the KJV and the NT. There are a lot of things in this book I agree with. For example, while a good number of Bible commentators are critical about some of the ways the Bible has been translated, most of the Bible was also read during the early church in the original languages, and there are a few things that I agree completely with. In fact, there are several quotes from Paul, James and Peter that have never been made into a popular version of their own writings. That's good! The problem is that the book was written in the late 19th century, and is very outdated. But as I say, I like to believe that if a book is written that was written as late as the late 18th century and is still good enough to be used by many Christians, it has something to offer.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read many books that dealt with the historical figures of the period, but nothing has come close to this book. It has so many valuable information about the period (from the American Revolution to the Civil War), as well as being extremely thorough and fair. The illustrations, too, are excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a beautiful, insightful book written by an insightful woman.  I was so excited about reading it, and couldn't put it down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea behind "No One's Hero" is interesting and intriguing.  I had read a lot of John Steinbeck novels, but "The Grapes of Wrath" was my favorite.  In this novel, Steinbeck focuses on the two main characters (the son and his father), who are trying to make a difference in the lives of others.  These two characters aren't exactly saints, but they are heroes to a surprising degree.  They don't necessarily act as a beacon of light on a dark road.  Their actions are often based on good intentions but they often make a poor decision.  At other times, they don't act as heroes at all and they just seem selfish. Â  They often appear to be self-centered and without remorse. Â  This makes them feel much better in some instances, but in others they act selfishly.  Even the son is portrayed negatively, as a self-absorbed, lazy, stupid person who doesn't do much. Â  Steinbeck tries to give the two characters a sense of redemption by showing that they don' t always get their way.  However, it is also difficult for him to show how one character became a hero.  To be honest, I don't think Steinbeck was successful in trying to convince these characters to become good.  The characters often appear as characters that simply lack the ability to change their lives for the better.  This would be an acceptable way for the hero to become a hero, but Steinbeck doesn't portray them in this way. Â  It seems like Steinbeck tried to force the characters to change, but the story doesn't reflect his efforts.  Perhaps this is a better way of portraying the characters, but I feel like this is not the best way.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It's one of the first I bought when I was in high school, and I still find it enjoyable today.  It's filled with so many interesting ideas about the world, from religion to politics, that I sometimes forget I'm reading about the Bible! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I didn't read a book in a very long time until recently.  It was one of those books that kept me interested until the very end.  I was pleasantly surprised when I finished reading it!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book, and I'm glad I did.   The authors take a look at the history of gender roles in the U.S. and then look at why that is a problem.  They do so in an engaging and informative way, and they point out why women have always done less, but never had it so easy.  The results of that are quite interesting, even if they aren't quite surprising.  This is a book worth recommending to any woman who thinks about these issues. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a great fan of the Grateful Dead, and have been for many years now.  However, I am not an expert on the Grateful experience and this book did a great job of giving a fuller picture of it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great novel: thoughtful, interesting, and often heartbreaking. This book is a must for anyone who loves science fiction and fantasy, but may be a little nervous about getting into reading about them.  I've heard that this book is available on Amazon, but not for my Kindle. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read The Girl on the Train when it came out, and then re-read it recently. I loved the idea behind it, and I thought it was the first great work of non-fiction about women in technology, but the execution left something to be desired. The writing was a bit wooden, the narrative was overly simplified, and the conclusions that the author reached were not entirely clear. But after rereading the book again, I have to say that she's at least partially right: it is not always about the "girl on the train" who has to overcome tremendous obstacles to succeed. I've always been fascinated with the way women make technology work in their lives. I didn't have the financial success or the political influence that the woman in the book did, but I did manage to make the leap from doing personal projects to the creation of systems and tools that have an impact on other people. The real power of women is not in what we can do for ourselves; it's in our ability to give back to the community, even if it's just to make our friends' lives a little easier. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in a weekend. I haven't read anything that is both good and readable in the same night since The Great Gatsby 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a real treasure, and a useful one for those who are trying to come to terms with the Church's current reality.  This is the first serious attempt to make sense of the current Church's predicament -- which is a tough nut to crack.  I was a skeptic, but had to face reality. I also had to see through the apologists' attempts to dismiss the Church and to justify it in terms of political and social trends.  There are many, many good things in the book, but this is the one that truly changed my mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very impressed with "When We Fall: The Surprising New Science That Will Restore Your Health, Fitness, and Life" by Dr. Brian Hahn. This book is a must for anyone looking for good nutrition advice that is realistic and effective. Dr. Hahn uses scientific research from the past several decades to show that we can expect to lose up to 30 pounds of fat in one year by simply eating less, exercising more, and reducing our calorie intake to 1500 calories or less per day.  This will result in a great loss of skin, cellulite, and unwanted fat.  Additionally, he uses scientific studies showing that weight loss is not limited to people who are overweight, but that the more successful dieters usually have a healthier and more active lifestyle.  He also points out that the best results come when one implements the same eating habits that one's ancestors did thousands of years ago, which is why he recommends that all of us cut down on sugar and refined carbohydrates as well as eat plenty of fish and grass-fed meat.   When I first started reading about the potential benefits of exercise in the context of weight loss, I was skeptical, but the research has never been more compelling.  If Dr.Hahn's studies prove true, then we could be losing 10-20 pounds of excess skin a year in less than a month.  To my surprise, he makes a convincing case that this is a viable way to achieve long-term weight loss.  A large part of the reason for this is that the amount of calories that we burn every day depends on the size of our muscles and the amount that we exercise.  When we expend the same number of calories every day as when we eat, we will lose fat and gain muscle.  Similarly, when we exercise, we burn more calories every time we walk a mile than when we sit down and do nothing.  In his book, Dr.B.H. demonstrates that the number of active minutes that we use every day is directly related to the amount and type of physical activity that we do.  I have personally lost 25 pounds in the last six months through the use of the "5x5" program.  Dr. B.H.'s weight loss program is based on the principles of intermittent fasting, and it is probably the best advice that I've heard in the past five years for anyone who wants to lose weight and maintain a healthy body weight. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I have read that makes an effort to explain the concept of the American Constitutional republic. I believe the book is highly recommendable, and even though some of the details are a bit too simple for my taste (i.e., the concept that there's no federal income tax), I think most readers will find some use for the concepts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of Steven Pressfield's books. In fact, I own the hardcover copy of The Power of Habit (which I have actually read and loved) and The New Humanist. So I was thrilled to read The New Animal in advance of its release date.   After reading it, I had to go out and buy two copies!  I loved the cover art, the "How to" chapters, and the book as a whole.  I hope this book gets a lot more traction and attention as it nears release. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have ever read on Buddhism. There are no bad translations, and no filler either. It is as straight forward and comprehensive as any other Buddhist book you will find, including books on other religions, especially Hinduism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really excited to pick up a good new book on the history of music by a very good music historian.  There were two other books I thought were really good on the subject and I was pretty sure I would love this one.   My main gripe was that the book was too short to get into the details of the musicians, so I didn't have a lot of time to look over them.  But that's kind of expected from a new work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think I might have read this book on one of those college course trips I was supposed to take with my parents, but ended up dropping out.  It seemed too easy, too generic, and not very original.  But reading it now, I realize that wasn't a bad thing.  The writing is good, the subject matter interesting, and the characters vivid.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in a bookstore while looking for books on the topic of atheism and was quite pleased that it didn't skimp on the details. This is a very comprehensive, well written and logical book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful. It is about how people's relationships and marriages can be saved or changed based on how they interact with the Lord. It gives you examples of many different ways people have made changes in their lives. It also gives some important truths about how to treat your spouse. I found it especially interesting how many of the women in the book had married people who were just a bit too aggressive in their relationships. They were doing all of the wrong things and weren't giving their spouse as much respect and love as they could have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been trying for years to read The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry. The book was one of those books that you can't put down and never wants to stop.   It's an incredibly touching story, but the fact that it was written by a French Jew also makes it all the more poignant.  I'm glad that a book that so clearly shows the love and care that people have for one another is coming to a library near you.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this very readable and interesting book, Robert M. Pirsig discusses the evolution of the internet, how it works, and how we have used it for good and bad. The book is a very good summary of both the good and the bad aspects of the net. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a bookworm from way back. I've read every James Patterson book I can find. I bought all his non-fiction books for my college library (my favorite genre, though I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it). But I think I've finally found a book that I've truly loved. It's one of those James Patterson mysteries that you can't put down -- and the illustrations were awesome. And the story itself was really well done. I thought that the ending was a little too perfect (even though I liked it anyway), but that's a small complaint.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is brilliant and has made a tremendous impact on my life. It is a simple book and is very much worth reading.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read this before in a different context, but I think this is the best review I've ever read about a literary work I've read.   It's a great book to read after you finish a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book ever on business, marketing, and organizational skills.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I could give the   book 5 stars I would   but the book is a bit uneven and at times too much of a slog.   I would like to see a revised edition of this book with more original material and a more compelling story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book from this collection is "The Great Dictator," by Joseph DeJarnette, a historian and political cartoonist. I found it fascinating in a number of ways. I don't know if DeJarmainette was a communist himself (his politics are unclear to me), but he writes of a number political prisoners he visited in various Soviet and Romanian prisons (his memoir "The Man in the Iron Mask" also has some good material). I found many similarities in their cases, as did many of the political prisoners DeJarme interviewed. It was interesting to compare their reactions to the brutality and political repression they endured in the camps with those of other Soviet prisoners in similar circumstances. Also, the memoir DeJarrhette wrote after his release, entitled "A Soviet Soldier's War," is very interesting and is one of the few Soviet prisoners' memoirs I've read in which the author was kind and humane, something I was surprised to learn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. I really liked the ideas and the overall style. It was a great introduction to the subject and it was a lot of fun to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The novel opens with the murder of two children by their father. I didn't know this until I was reading the book, but I think the book's main themes are about how children are vulnerable and can be exploited. The author has been an excellent source for a lot of literature on child abuse and neglect. If you're interested in reading more on this topic, I'd recommend reading about abuse and murder in other parts of the world.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked the book a lot.  The author does an excellent job of bringing out the strengths and weaknesses of each of the characters in the book.  Although many of the main characters in this book seem rather dull at first, I was quickly able to like them.  I enjoyed the dialogue between Rhea and Harry.  Their dynamic in the beginning was a bit jarring.  At first I thought they had a sexual attraction, but then realized that Rhea was probably the most "normal" of the three women.  While the other two characters were rather creepy, the interaction between Rhelle and Harry was really interesting.  All in all, the characters did their best to make the story enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It has the best plot I have ever read in any book   The main character is the most realistic and likable of any protagonist I have read   This is not a children's book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had been looking for a book on the psychology of parenting since I lost my young daughter, in part because I thought that there had been very little research on this subject, and in part, I was interested in the impact that a child's birth had on their development. I found both of these things to be true, and that the book is very good, well-researched, and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book I've ever written that I've actually enjoyed reading. The style is elegant, clear, and easy to follow. There is nothing in this book that is poorly written or that doesn't make logical sense, which is a very difficult feat to pull off. It would have been very difficult to write the book if I had a better grasp of the English language. In fact, I still have to read the original sources of the book because the book reads like someone translated it for me. It reads better than I did. In other words, this book reads good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was one of my first books I have bought. It was well-written and kept my attention.   The plot is a little unclear, so I'm going to reread the first chapter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's easy to get into and fun to read.  I think it'll take me awhile to get tired of it.   I'd recommend it to a friend who enjoys reading good books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. I'd had some doubts about the book as I tend to think that a good explanation of a complex phenomenon can be found much more quickly and simply in the popular literature, rather than the technical journals or books that deal with the same topics. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were no obvious mistakes or weaknesses in the basic analysis. As I read, I came to see many of the claims made in the book in the light of my own research. It also led me to realize that some of the things that I'd suspected to be true were actually not true. For example, the idea that the brain is designed to allow the user to switch between tasks (as described in the title of the book) turned out to be false; the brain appears to be designed to keep a running list of the various types of information it can process, and to switch to that list as needed. That meant that it was actually possible to switch seamlessly between thinking about something abstract (like the origins of language) and doing something concrete (such as typing on a computer). I was also surprised by the extent to which many of our ideas about the mind, such as the "hardware is software" idea, turned out not to be very true. My theory was that the hard-wiring idea stems from a misunderstanding about how the brain and other organs are connected. In my view, hard-wired processes are necessary for certain things, but they don't necessarily reflect the way that the organism actually is. It's possible to have a fully-wired system that produces an amazing outcome with no hard wiring, but a perfectly-wired one that produces disastrous results. That's why the phrase "hard-wired" gets tossed around so often, because it sounds so simple. It seems that when you look at the brain, it is just a software program, designed to perform the functions that it's designed to do. That means that things like "the mind is hard-coded" are correct, but things like a computer's memory is simply a software-driven database.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was surprised and delighted to read this excellent novel about a young black man in the South who discovers the meaning of freedom in the midst of racism. While I did have some problems with the language, the themes, and some parts of the plot, I still found myself engrossed in the story. I think most students of black America will find it relevant, even insightful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author has written a great book, and it's free. It's a little heavy on mathematics, but it is necessary to understand how computer and networking systems work to be a successful programmer. It is not just for hackers, but for anyone who needs to work with computers. I'm still learning how to use them! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first half is about a girl and her father in the middle of an interminable fight that has been going on for a year. Her father is a real jerk, and she has no idea how to deal with him. He thinks that she's being disrespectful and trying to get back at him, but it's really just because he's not particularly happy with her. At the end of the first half, he shows up with a "big news," and her mother and sister are really excited to hear it. However, they soon discover that the news is untrue, that she actually didn't do anything to deserve the divorce, and that she only wants to go back to his place. Instead, she has been kicked out of the house by her mother for being disrespectful, and has ended up living with her grandparents. The second half deals with the two of them moving back in, and the father gets much more involved in his daughter's life. But after two weeks, he decides that she doesn't seem like she wants to be living at home anymore, and instead wants to move back to her parents. The daughter and her friends are all really happy about this, and want to take her with them. But instead, the father decides to take his daughter to a party at her grandparents' house. The whole scene is heartbreaking, because I really, really liked the daughter and wanted to do everything in my power to help her succeed. Then the father shows up and is absolutely brutal about it, saying that the whole situation was her fault. But then the daughter's mother turns up and totally freaks out about the situation. The mother thinks that it's a waste of money to take the daughter to an expensive, fancy party, and also thinks that the daughter should stay at home and not be involved with anyone. Meanwhile, the daughter ends up having a really fun time, and everyone is really proud of her. All of this is ruined when the father's friend arrives and yells at them for not coming with her to the party. The end of it all is that the son and his friends decide to move to live with the parents and the daughter, but decide against it when they find out that it will mean having to move out by the end The second half of this book is so heartbreaking. The way the father is completely heartless about his daughter is just really heartbreaking. I can't believe he treated his daughter like that. It's not that he's a bad person,
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't usually read long and lengthy books, but this one really stood out to me.  I was particularly drawn to the chapter on women in history, as that is something I tend to ignore in my general reading.  As a result, it really is a breath of fresh air when a book such as this breaks through the "historical" and "narrative" sludge of so much historical fiction.  This book is very well written, but even better is the author's dedication to women.  Even though he is writing about men, his perspective is still a valuable one.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book explains the psychological underpinnings of a lot of the bad behavior in our culture. It also touches on the psychological and social factors that can influence a person to do wrong and wrong again. I have a long list of books to read in the coming years, and I've been itching to read this one ever since I first heard about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is interesting as a general study of different cultures. It is also very interesting as an exploration of the life and work of the Dalai Lama, whose philosophy is very much like that of Buddhism.   A Buddhist author was kind enough to give a copy to a friend. He was able to tell me the author is a practicing Buddhist and that the book is very well written and well-written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must read. I've always wanted to learn about the lives of the African slaves. I was fortunate enough to have been brought up in the African American community and was well-versed in African history and culture. I also was able to travel to Africa and learn from the African Christians of Ghana. I finally learned the name of a woman I had prayed to, "Please bring me my people." She did. Unfortunately, she wasn't in her right mind. But I'm going to keep hoping that someday I can go back and meet her and ask her why she didn't come back and bring her people. I hope that I can see her in a new light. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, like so many others, is about people struggling to be more accepting of their own selves and what they have to offer. As in the first half, the second part focuses on self-acceptance and it is both very important and really hard.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband loves this book. He is a huge Tolkien fan and we often talk about his favorite characters. The characters are well done, and they are really interesting. He told me about one of the characters and how he really liked how he was developed. I agree with him.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book should be mandatory reading for every university student. It is filled with great historical data that will serve the reader well in their career as well as in their life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My first attempt at reading a nonfiction book was, of all things, The Best Way to Rob a Bank . It was a decent introduction to the subject, though I found the pacing a little off. The next nonfiction I read in my reading binges was A Good Soldier and a Bad Bank Robber by Charles Bronson, and that one took some doing (I didn't know that a bank robber had a good military record). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not the best at science, but I'm a pretty good amateur, and I'm glad I was able to learn about this book.  It doesn't teach me the way a good science textbook should, but it's much better than the alternatives I found online.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only nonfiction book about the church I've read so far this year.  I enjoyed reading it and plan to purchase more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book. It's a great book about writing in a variety of genres: poetry, fiction, memoir, etc. I learned a ton about the craft from reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's very well written and the style was great. I liked it so much I bought a second copy to share with friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! I read it for the first time in a while and was so taken with it that I ordered another copy, just to have at my desk when I'm writing.  The characters are relatable, funny, and well-developed.  Even the less-than-flattering characters are likable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete and accurate account that I have of the life of John F. Kennedy, including his presidency and administration, as it happened. Filled with primary sources, and backed up with extensive research, it's the first and best book on the subject.  It covers everything from his high school days, to his college years, his life in politics, his campaign, his rise in the Senate and his assassination.  John F was a highly ambitious and intelligent man, and was able to make the most out of his opportunities and talent. He had the ability to understand politics, to lead, and to make people take notice, despite the often negative aspects of his personality.  He always had a way to get people's attention, whether he was talking about the Vietnam War or civil rights.   F would often be the only member of the Kennedy family not to appear on television.  I find that I appreciate the depth of this book the most, since I was a Kennedy fan from birth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books which if I read it 10 years ago, I would probably not have read it at all. Then, a few years ago I reread it and have become a huge fan of it.  It's a well-written book about some very interesting topics and I'm sure it will have a long life in the popular consciousness as the most well-regarded book about homosexuality in American history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book makes the subject of homosexuality more accessible. Although there are a number of well-known works on the subject, many of them lack the detail and insight that is found in this book. I've found that other authors tend to focus too much on the social aspects and miss the biological aspects. By focusing on the biological side, we miss some of the more positive aspects of being homosexual. Furthermore, a lot of what we think about our sexuality is based on the image we have in our mind. If we can change that image, we can learn how to use our sexual feelings for our own benefit instead of just being used by them.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good introduction to the historical development of Mormonism.  It goes deep into many aspects of the religion and its history.  Many of the problems associated with modern Mormonism can be traced back to the early years, particularly the failure to adopt the social, political, and economic reforms associated with the New England Reformation. The authors do a fine job of laying out the doctrinal development of the LDS Church over the past two millennia. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is absolutely amazing.  It tells the history of women's rights, and why some women think they've won their rights and others think they have no rights at all.   It is a fascinating read, with examples of some of the most prominent women's organizations in America, their goals, and the obstacles they faced to reach them.  This is a history book, not just of feminism, but of women who have worked together and are not afraid to say:  - We are women. - We should be free to be women.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book a while back.   It is a very readable history of the French Revolution, in the sense of the events themselves.  It covers many aspects of the time that are of interest to historians and students, including the role of women, the impact of the Revolution on the family and the impact on religion.  The book has a lot of interesting data on this subject, and even offers a couple of interesting anecdotes from the revolution.  As such, it is an excellent choice for an introductory text for a new class in French history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book over the course of about a month or so.  It's an excellent introduction to the field of functional programming.  As someone who has been working in a large, commercial software company for the past 18 years, it was interesting to see how functional programming has changed the way I think about software.  In particular, this book is very interesting for my own personal development in this field. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In the early 1990s, my mother, who was a psychologist and also the youngest of seven children, was one of the youngest women to join a clinical psychologist group. She had been doing private therapy for 15 years but had always been frustrated by how hard it was. The group was like being on the front lines, giving her the support she needed to become the successful therapist she wanted to be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a hard time reading some of the negative reviews, but I think I can explain this to the author.  He writes in the third person, which means that the characters he describes don't have any actual lives outside of his or her book.  Even in the chapters where they do, there's no connection to anything else that is happening, which can be a little jarring.  However, this is a good use of third person narration, especially since the author has an actual character named Jack.  I love the scenes in which Jack is in the bathtub with Lillith, the bathwater is in Jack's hair and he is so immersed in the water that he almost passes out.  Jack is also so close to the character of Lill, he can read her mind and understand her when she says things.  The author uses this to his advantage to show that Jack is a wonderful lover, as opposed to a bad one.  Also, I don't know how the author manages to get his characters to act so well while simultaneously making them so unlikable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have not seen a better book written on the subject of sexual repression. I had read a few books on this subject but none that addressed the psychological aspects of sexual repressedness. Dr. Sigmund Freud's "The Interpretation of Dreams" and "Eros and Civilization" (by H. H. Holmes) provide the best psychological treatment of sexual frustration. "Hooking Up" is written with the same candor as "Eyes Wide Shut" by Lawrence, and provides a more personal approach to the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always been curious about the history of the "Kerouac" publishing company and decided to pick up a copy.  This is an excellent book.  It's definitely worth the money. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My family and I enjoy the book "The Great Gatsby." My daughter, who is an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and works part-time as a secretary, enjoyed the book. We have both enjoyed "The Life of Alexander Pope" and "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" and like the stories of "Borat" and other films. The writing is very interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. I have been reading it for over a year now. I love how she combines her experiences as a black woman in America and a white woman in France to show us what it was like to grow up in this country. Her stories of growing up in a racist environment with no one to speak out against it are so powerful that it's almost a relief when she leaves. She doesn't give in to her mother's attempts to teach her the language and the traditions and I loved that she stayed so true to her American culture. She knows that her mother will never understand the depth of what she wants to say. I didn't realize how much I was going to love this until she says at one point that her greatest disappointment is that her son is an "unnatural born" white man.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book, and it has been on my long list of recommended reading.  The book describes the "three rules" that parents should teach their children.   The rules are: 1) Don't criticize another person. 2) If you don't understand something, don't talk about it. 3) Never speak badly of your parents.  As I mentioned, I liked the "don't talk badly about your parents" rule.  I think my parents did it too.  But the rule about "never speak badly about anyone" was a little tough for me to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite reads. It is a well-written account of how the American economy works, what our politicians are up to, and what the people who actually do the work think about it.  I'm very pleased with the book and recommend it to anyone who wants a comprehensive book on this subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book on the flight back from Australia, and it took my mind off my troubles at work and my marriage. I hope to have more of the wonderful books by the author in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read this book a couple times and really like it each time. It's not a short story in the way that a good novel is a short book, but it's a good story with interesting characters, great dialogue, a decent pace, and plenty of action. I'm not sure I've read anything in the paranormal genre quite like it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book while in the process of converting to the Catholic faith and was extremely grateful for the information.  The author describes the process from the Catholic perspective and gives a helpful outline of the steps that will be needed for a successful conversion. The author points out that Catholics are a hardy people, that they have overcome persecution and that their faith has been sustained through the centuries.  I have not had to face persecution myself, but I do have to contend with religious dogma and culture that seem to contradict my faith. I don't consider myself a convert but am glad that this book has given me some pointers along the way.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The novel is a brilliant exploration of the role of women in nineteenth-century American culture, from their role in the church to their influence on the political and social landscape of the country. It's a fascinating look at how women of the past shaped the present--and how their influence continues to shape it to this very day.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little skeptical at first. This book is written by an atheist who is working to help people reject their faith.  In a lot of ways, this book is a little dry and even a little preachy. But it does a good job of giving a good overview of religion, and even of a lot Christians who actually leave their religion, like this man, who is trying to do that in his own way.   The book is also pretty well written and I can see that he was trying to present information in a way that was easy to understand. I also agree with the last sentence:  "I wish I could just go back in time and change my mind about everything I ever believed... But I can't." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found The Little Prince a good, if somewhat odd, story. It's about a young boy and his imaginary friend, a bird called Pip. The book is about how a boy is so lonely that he builds an imaginary friend out of his crayons and other little objects. The Little King is a big, bad king, but Pip is kind and always good to the boy. Unfortunately, the boy's parents are strict and refuse to let him do anything nice for his imaginary friends. The story ends on a sad note, as Pip is finally abandoned by the imaginary friend who helped him grow up. The ending does give a happy ending, though.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a big fan of the first book. I've never been so moved by a book. So many words were written with such depth and precision about the suffering of a family through war.   It was heartbreaking to read this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My mother read this book when I was a teenager and never got tired of it. The story was so well told and so well written that she had to re-read it several times just to be sure she had the point. Even as a reader, she kept re-reading it in a desperate attempt to make sense of how the author was able to tell such a story. The ending was also an excellent touch. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so glad that my kids and I have been reading these books together and getting the same laughs all the time. My favorite scene has my son and I going on adventures in a shopping mall in the first book, then having a much better time in another mall in "Boots of Slipping and Sliding."   It's so funny that the same characters are in the same mall and getting their kicks. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found myself thoroughly engaged in the book and I was impressed by the depth of the discussion, with the author's extensive use of primary sources and the depth and variety of her interviews. The book also covers many other important topics, such as how the church can improve its handling of rape allegations and sexual abuse, as well as how it can better respond to financial difficulties, and its problems in dealing with gay and lesbian members.   If you have been in a Mormon church for a while and are wondering if the church is a good place to be,  This book is the definitive response to that question. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had read many books about the Holocaust before I found this one, but this one is the first one that made a real impact on me. This is the kind of book that makes you want to get out and do something about the genocide.   There's a part about the concentration camps in the book that's so heartbreaking that I want to see the book in a Holocaust museum, or go back and watch the movie The Third Reich. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've enjoyed all the books I've read by the author - but I think this one is particularly fun.  The story revolves around a new student, who turns into the sort of character who deserves a good old-fashioned dungeon crawl.  She is the sort to challenge the status quo - even if that challenge is only to see who can get through a door in the quickest time - which she does effortlessly.  Also, I particularly like her roleplaying abilities - she isn't afraid to tell the class what she'd do if she were in charge, which has been a great resource for many of us in my life 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The two most important things a book has to teach the reader is that they should live their lives according to their principles and never to be taken advantage of. I read this book when I was still living my principles and didn't want to be fooled. I learned a lot about living as an independent woman, not as a dependent wife. I didn't realize it at the time, but the author is talking about me. She gives us the "do's" and "don'ts" of how to live our life and how to avoid being taken advantage off of. She also offers practical ideas about money that I didnï¿½t know about and I would do everything in my power to implement in my life. I will definitely use these tools when I travel for business.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read about the Vietnam War ever.  For someone who's been away from the book for decades, it was extremely compelling and made me want to get back to Vietnam, because it was such a pivotal and tragic time.    I've found that most of the best books about the war are written by veterans of the war and the author of this book is one of the most well known and respected Vietnam War writers.  I also enjoyed that this book came out the same year as the film, as it gave a realistic perspective to what the war was like for all sides. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been meaning to read this for a while, and I finally got around to it. The first sentence is what got me. I've read some pretty great stuff in the past, including the early, early, first draft of A Clockwork Orange (which is, of course, now lost to history). But this one is a cut above, and the fact that it's written in the first person by the protagonist is the icing on the cake. The book is about a young man, Alex, whose father is being forced out of his job as an assistant director by the new management of his department. Alex gets the job and is immediately made responsible for a large amount of their work. And the first thing he does is use his superior skills as an engineer to write a computer program that will save everyone time on long, tedious tasks. And so the book begins. Alex is a bit of a loner and the book makes that very clear, but he's also a fairly intelligent, determined young man. It's a bit hard to like the book when it's clear Alex is pretty much the only person in the department who can actually think of anything else. He's not even given much to do and is left to his own devices (although he does manage to turn out one of the most enjoyable games ever made.) That said, the plot is pretty solid, and Alex's problems are well written and believable. If you're interested in some of the science in action, this is definitely one to check out. I haven't yet finished it, but I'm sure it will be worth the wait.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, while far from a masterpiece, does a good job of conveying important, but seldom realized, lessons about the true nature of love. It's so often difficult to understand the importance of love, especially to those who experience it, but the complexity of this story is captured so well. If you are not aware of the role that love plays in our lives, this book is definitely worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked reading this book. The plot is intriguing, the characters are likable, the style is very readable. This book is a bit old-fashioned for my taste, but I really liked it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   It is a history of the world as told by a great poet.  It also has a few things in it that I think are worth reading and discussing.  I would say, though, that I found the book to be a little turgid at times.  The focus was on a few figures like Dante, Shakespeare, Beethoven, and Emerson that are important to me but that might have gotten lost in the shuffle of history if they were all given their own chapters.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a big fan of Michael Gove's best selling book The Cliches of Politics when it first came out.  I loved the insight it offered in explaining many of the political fallacies I had encountered.  Gove also had a knack for writing captivating sentences and for laying out his arguments without any of the dry intellectual analysis one might expect from a writer of scholarly prose.  In The Cents of Politics, Gove provides a much needed corrective to many of our common misunderstandings about politics.  If you have read Gove you will not be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting a better sense of the history of the Christian Church.  It is written in a very accessible, conversational style that allows the reader to understand the background and significance of all the main points.  I believe the book is especially valuable for those who want to take a more systematic approach to studying the history but have been unable to find such books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the real deal. You get to meet, learn from, and ultimately succeed with a great leader.  This author has done a great job in writing this book.  There are countless times in my career when the right person came along and I have made a decision to follow them.  I learned so much from this book from what a great guy he is to work with and from the lessons he's learned.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book immensely. It covers many interesting topics and is filled with a plethora of excellent examples.  The book is filled to the brim with references, photos and interesting graphs that provide a wealth of information to enhance the learning process. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be a very well researched and well written piece of literature. The author, a psychologist, makes very important points in this book and in many other places throughout his writing. He also points out the ways in which psychological problems of modern life are not unique to the 1960's and 70's. The book is well written and is written in a manner that the reader should know something about psychology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been listening to this book for a long time, even though I've never read it.   It's the perfect companion for any serious student of Buddhism, since it combines the study of Buddhism and the study (or application) of economics.  This is the perfect book for anyone interested in economics, especially since it's by someone who's spent a lot of time studying economics. It's also very entertaining, especially in the second half, which is devoted to a discussion of the "Golden Rule."  The Golden Rule is essentially a set of rules about how one should treat others (as in "do unto others as you would have them do unto you").  In a sense, this rule seems to make sense: what we like to do to other people and what we want others to do for us should be mutually beneficial.  But I think the Golden Rule also contains a very important idea: the notion that all good behavior is a kind of "good karma," which can actually be quantified and translated into financial gain.  That's right:  karma can be quantized.  The idea is that "if I do X, then I shall get Y in the future."  Karma is a very interesting idea:  When it comes to doing good, there's no such thing as doing something bad in the pursuit of good.  It is, however, something that can be measured.  As a student of economic theory, I find that very interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read for any student of American history 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very pleased with this novel. In fact, I bought it so that I could read it again.  As it turned out, I wasn't just pleased; I was downright ecstatic.  I had long suspected that this novel is a good one.  This one has that "fuzzy" feeling that you often get when reading a good mystery novel.  It's not the same type of book as Carrie  but I felt that it was similar.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I have read on the Holocaust in the last thirty years.    He examines the issue from the very beginning, and never lets the Holocaust off the hook.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the Holocaust and the people responsible for it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best short fiction I have ever read!   It is the best example of 'fantasy world-building' I have seen - and I have read many books that make the point with their own magic systems.  It takes the traditional genre and makes it fresh, exciting, and very memorable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has opened my eyes and changed my attitude toward the church. I have been a "believer" since I was a kid, but this book has helped me realize the real reasons why I feel that way.   I know I've been wrong about so much in my life, but I know now that the LDS Church is not as God is describing it.  I love all the things the Church does for me, but the fact that I have to go to the Church to get them is beyond belief. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a fan of Michael Pollan for years. He is an excellent writer and his books have always been informative and entertaining. His latest book, "Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation," is no exception. I think the book is both well written and entertaining, and I would recommend it highly. I found it very informative and enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Book: "Racialized Politics in America." Â  This book is a collection of articles written by sociologists, criminologists, and others in an attempt to explain why we have so many black on black crime and violence.  The theory, called structural racism, states that, while the system may make it easier for certain groups to live in certain areas, it makes it harder for those same groups to create jobs and live in good neighborhoods.  This is an article about that theory and how it applies to black people in America today. "Racism is structural"    While I'm on the subject of why it's hard to get a job:Â  The reason there are so many unemployed black people (as well as white people) is that white people are much better at getting jobs than people of color.Â  As for why it is harder for black people to live where they want to live:Â  This article addresses that as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book in this collection is The Secret Garden. I bought it on my own as a teenager, as I was drawn to the book's many characters and plot.  As I matured, I thought about how these characters changed over the years, how their lives and fates were intertwined, how they became closer as they grew up and older, and how they all got away with their sins and even more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am reading the fourth edition of this excellent series, The Wisdom of Psychopaths, and I am continually amazed at the remarkable talents of some of its characters. I read about psychopaths in the late 1950s and 1960s and, for some reason, I never thought about them in a serious way until now. It seems like they are everywhere! I am not sure why I never considered these people to be particularly evil until now but there they are: A young psychopath named Paul Anthony, who is the star quarterback of a team of football players; A woman who gets on my nerves by always having to put down her drink and take a seat when I sit down; A couple who spend their day working in the garage and are always talking about their big house; A young man with a talent for making money in real estate; A retired police chief who is constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to abuse the police and even get himself promoted to detective; A man who loves sports and can be a good athlete even though he is bad at chess and bad at football; A rich lawyer who is good at making his clients seem more important than they actually are. What is also remarkable about these people is that their behavior seems almost normal and in some cases, normal behavior seems to have no obvious underlying cause. It's a wonder that anyone survives in the real world. I had no idea that psychopaths were such clever, intelligent, and charming people who are good at everything they do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an absolute gem. There's a lot of information, some of it really dry, but it's also filled with information that makes a lot more sense. The author is very fair-minded and doesn't have an agenda. And although he gets more specific in later books, he still makes a great effort to be thorough and accurate. I'll definitely be reading the rest of the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book and recommend it highly to people who want to improve their writing and are unsure about what to do next.   For the price, the advice in the book is outstanding.  A quick look at the blog entry   "Five Ways to Write Less"   seems like good advice on paper, too.  If only writing was this easy.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed reading this book. I've been writing and editing a lot of nonfiction for a variety of audiences (such as memoirs, academic essays, and history), and I've found that there is usually a tradeoff between "easy" reading and the kind of quality I'm looking for. While some nonfiction is written in a way that makes it easy to skim through, such as by using simple, straight forward prose that's not too complicated, this book has an interesting and challenging writing style that made it challenging for me to read.  This was a real treat and I'll definitely be re-reading it in the future!
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, Rene Girard argues for the need for a change in our understanding of the nature of God. I am not a Christian or a mystic or even a pantheist. I'm more of a naturalist. But this book has really helped me to see that we are in fact all pantheists. I would like to see a little more of an attempt at understanding the God of the Bible and what it is that makes us think God exists. I suspect that the God in the Bible has an inner life that is much more mysterious than we imagine. He might even be a bit of an alien. I can't believe that it was all about the food.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be a very useful guide to using the computer in a non-recreational manner.  It really gets down to the nitty gritty of working with a computer and how much trouble it can cause if not handled properly.  The first part of the book covers operating systems, basic usage of a command prompt, and basic file manipulation.  Then the author goes into the operating systems in detail.  He covers the different versions and types of MS-DOS, and how to switch from one system to the next in a controlled way.  This is important since a new operating system usually comes with some other problems.  Lastly, he covers the use of MS Word and the various ways to format text to make it easy to copy.  I have used Word to write a manuscript for use in a class, and I found it to be very easy to use and to format my text correctly.  There were some places where I thought he did a poor job and could have done a better job, but overall, I'm very satisfied with the content. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading many popular "hard science" books over the years and this one has been one of my favorites. It is very readable, logical, and non-fictional and a good source for those of us who are curious about our universe. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been listening to a lot of audio books lately and this one stood out as a great one. It is clear and easy to understand. It has many good illustrations, and there are no clunky transitions between different pages. It includes plenty of anecdotes from different people, making it a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I had been reading about the life of William Shakespeare and the role that he played in the founding of the American theater but had never read anything about his personal life and the things he did for the needy and poor. I've been very interested in the history of the social work profession for a very long time and was very interested to read about William Shakespeare.    His writing is wonderful and it's very difficult to summarize, but he did a very good job of covering the entire range of his activities.  He has very specific goals for what he's trying to accomplish and he accomplished it.  I learned about a woman who was having an affair with a neighbor and William Shakespeare got her out of that situation.  William Shakespeare even got a woman to marry her after their affair was discovered.  It was an amazing thing that Shakespeare was able to accomplish as a man in his position. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very informative, and I enjoyed reading about a variety of topics.  The author is very knowledgeable on his subject.  It's not just about how to develop your writing skills, but also about the many other aspects of life that have to do with your writing.  I also liked the idea of teaching your children how to write.  This could also be helpful to non-native English speakers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In a nutshell, this book is about my first year of college, which was pretty traumatic for me. I am a very social person and I love to see other people having fun. Unfortunately, in that first year I wasn't in the right frame of mind. I thought it was fun when friends did something stupid and I had to stop them, but as I got older and my social skills improved, I realized it wasn't always fun. This book describes a lot of the ways that the social aspect of college can be hard on people and how one can make it a little bit more fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been so thrilled with this book . I found it so interesting because it's based on the historical records of one particular time, and yet at the same time it addresses modern concerns in a very accessible way... I also learned so much from this book. I know nothing about the history of the Mormon Church before the 19th century, but I thought that by studying these documents, we would be able to get some insight into it.   This book is such a gift. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always liked Robert Jordan, but this one is better.  Jordan is a great writer, but his characters tend to be the weak link of his work. He does some decent research, but he tends to focus on how good the main characters are. This book focuses on the secondary characters. I'm really happy with how the characters and the world came together. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first started reading this book when I was in college, and it was a little disappointing. It was a lot like reading an autobiography (albeit written by a woman) and I found the main character's personal story boring. However, after my review about the first book, I went back and reread it. It's not quite as bad, but it still isn't quite as good.  This book really helps you to understand what I mean by that.  Although it's very different than other books you've read, it's still very well written and I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been meaning to read this book since I first read about it in a college textbook.  This book is so good that I found myself recommending it to my high schooler for a future edition.  It is a fascinating look at the impact of technology on our lives and on the world in general.  You can tell that this book was researched and written with a level of care that would have been reserved for more high profile topics.  And yet, it manages to capture the reader in a way that makes this book very relatable and relevant.  The book is written with enough information and examples to make it easy to understand, but also enough subtle humor and insight to make the book compelling in spite of its brevity.  There are some things that have stuck with me that I didn't expect to, and the story of how the invention of the electric phone affected the lives of the phone company workers who worked in the switchboard room is a great example of one.  I found it very entertaining and I can't wait to read more about it!
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fun read about some of the most memorable, well-known and memorable characters of all time. I laughed so hard I cried. I'm obsessed with this series and will read the next one in the series when I finish this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a wonderful book. I got it at the library and it was very well written. I also received a nice thank-you card as a thanks. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I have read some books that describe life in ancient Egypt as a nightmare and others that describe it as a time of bliss. However, this book is the first that I can honestly say describes life in the former way with a good amount of humor.  There are several stories in this book that I found interesting, even if I didn't understand them completely at the time. I also found that one of the stories was very funny, although I can't recall the details at the moment. Overall, I found this book to be an interesting and entertaining read, although it might be a bit too much for some people. I know I liked it quite a bit, despite some of the jokes, because it made me feel like I was experiencing life in Ancient Egypt, instead of the "worst place on earth" that I have been reading about in the media.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I finished This book after a week of marathon reading, so my overall impression is that it's a quick read, but one that will have a great impact on me. I am going to teach myself Python 3 this semester, and my computer is a Macbook Pro. This book will make it a lot easier to do so, as it provides some really helpful, in-depth examples on both how to use the Python 3 language, and the Python 2 language.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fun and interesting read. It's not going to change the way I think about any of my political views, but it may change my perspective on the way things work in politics. If you like history and know a little bit about the US government, you're in for a good time. If not, you'll still get a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, written by a former member of the Mormon church, provides a new perspective on what it means to be a Mormon. While the author did not have an "official" place in the church, he still believes strongly in its doctrines, and writes about his conversion, the difficulties he encountered along the way, and how that led him to decide to leave the church. He also writes about a time when he was in a car accident, after which he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, which left him unable to drive.    In addition, the author writes about being a missionary in Italy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got my hands on this book while looking for a good horror book for my son. I'm very pleased with it and will reread it often. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. The author is an experienced journalist and he shows his journalistic skills by writing about important topics. He covers a lot of ground, but is most successful in the first part of the book. That part discusses the use of pseudonyms in the book reporting of a scandal that affected the Church of Scientology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book. Its a very clear and well researched book on the history and significance of women in the Civil War. In it we get to see women in a positive light, such as those who took up arms for the Union, the women who served with General Lee and George Custer, and the women of the 4th Massachusetts (a volunteer organization of women and children that took part in the capture of Petersburg). It was the women's role that was the most interesting and positive in the book, as they played an important role in protecting themselves and their children from the effects of the war and also in preventing their husbands from deserting. These women were not only able to survive the war, but they were able to return to civilian life without suffering as many of their husbands did.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when it was first published, and I was totally underwhelmed. At the time, I was in the middle of a massive divorce. So I thought "Why bother with a divorce book?" I found the writing style to be a bit flowery and romantic, and not all that helpful.  But now, with a whole new perspective on life, this book has actually been very helpful. I can relate to the woman who said that she wished she had taken this book more seriously when she was in her early 20's.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful primer on the origins of the Catholic Church.  It is not perfect, but it is a great guide to what we should all be thinking about.  I was skeptical of the claims made in the book at first, but they are solid and compelling.  This is not just another apologetics book, but rather one that tries to be historically accurate.  There are no attempts to prove that Jesus ever existed, but instead we are told the facts as we know them.  While there are plenty of errors in this book, they are fairly minor and easy to correct, so it is worth the read just for the great overview and discussion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My daughter read this book when she was four and it was absolutely fabulous! She absolutely loves it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book that has kept me reading all my nonfiction books for years.  It covers a wide range of topics including women's issues, religion, race, and the arts.  Although I did not learn the lessons that she intended, she left the reader with the feeling that she had understood her own experiences and made a point of sharing her observations with others.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read "How I Live Now" in June 2014, and read it again just this morning. I'm happy I did. I can't stress enough how refreshing and enlightening a book this is.   The book is short, and is written in the second person, so it is a bit difficult to read if you aren't familiar with the author's writing style. However, it is interesting and well-written and is a good reminder to learn new skills, and to not become so fixated on your ego and the status you occupy in the world that you forget to do something great for the planet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book, and learned a lot of things that I didn't know. It was very enlightening. I hope that people will read this book and learn more about Islam from it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was intrigued by the title when I first started the book ( I've been a fan of David Copperfield and The Haunted Man series), and then really enjoyed the story. It's not as dark and grim as some of the other Copperfield books I've read (I've read the early Copperfield series and the Copperfield Chronicles), but it's entertaining, and has a good ending for most of the characters.   It's a bit slow at the beginning, but once things get going, it's a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book contains some of the most intelligent and thoughtful work that I've ever read about Judaism.  It is a tour-de-force work of historical research and intellectual argumentation, and its most important argument is that there has never been a monotheistic religion in the history of the world.  The best example of the book is the introduction that is largely an account of the Jewish reaction to Christianity, which the author says was, in a sense, monotheist but not monotheistical:  " The Jewish reaction was to reject Christianity as monotheism (at least in the Greek sense), for it was monotheists that had introduced the term 'God' into the theological vocabulary in which Judaism was practiced. Monotheism, in this reading, implied the notion that God was a being distinct from God's other creations (beings like angels, demons, or even men and women). This is why Christians have frequently argued that Jews do not believe in the God of Abraham. The problem with the Jewish attitude toward Christ is not that it is a denial of monothehood but that it turns God into a God-man who is separate from his other creations. The Jewish concept of monothelitism was very different from monotheitism as it is commonly understood, for Jews believed that God is not a person but a Being, a supreme being, a deity, a power above and apart from his creatures. They believed that all things in the universe, both animate and inanimate, have a divine nature which they have inherited from their ancestors. They saw themselves as divine, as having the same divine nature that their ancestors had. That is why they worshipped all their ancestors as God, as sons and daughters of God, since they were divine in their own right. (p. 7) This is a good summary of the thesis that Christianity was monolatratic and in fact opposed to monotheotheism.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of my favorite books on philosophy and religion.  I read it when I was about twelve, and have re-read it many times since.  It is a clear and thought-provoking introduction to the subject that does not fall victim to over-complication.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much! It was well written and thoroughly interesting. I feel like I could go on for days about some of the things I learned, especially about the cultural influences that make up a character's character.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful exploration of an intriguing phenomenon - the difference between our thoughts and our feelings. While I haven't yet had an experience similar to mine (I think the book does a very good job of explaining that), I find this book to be a lot of fun. It also helps me to understand better, to a much greater degree than I have, why I sometimes make terrible life choices. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this is the best nonfiction on how a good work of fiction is written I have ever read. It is not only a highly intelligent and well-crafted analysis of a good novel, it is also a very readable and engaging book on all things literary. It has the advantage of being written by a real author (not a fiction writer), which makes it even more satisfying. This is the kind of book that helps keep you on a good reading schedule for good writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must have book for all science and engineering students who want to learn about the structure of life.   It explains what we don't know about living things, how these structures evolved, and the consequences of such changes.  It also discusses how we can create new structures that mimic biological structures and how the new structures can be better than the old ones.  This book gives practical advice on how to do this.  I also appreciate the authors' detailed discussion of some of the important scientific findings of the 20th century.  There are a lot of great quotes from well-known scientists in this book that give a great perspective on the significance of these developments. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   The story is good; the characters are likable; and the way the story is told makes it engaging. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great introduction to the history of the French language. It includes an amazing collection of quotations from great authors, and the authors' contributions are both entertaining and helpful.  A wonderful companion to the excellent "Froggy and His Friends," an interesting, engaging book about the history and development of the french language. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading " The Book of the New Sun." This is the first book I've ever heard anyone mention that the first volume in a series "should" be read "after the second" instead of "at the same time" (or maybe "in parallel"). I hadn't read that kind of book before (I used to prefer the "universe-jumping" epic fantasies by Robert E. Howard, but "The Book of Cthulhu" was just more "weird"). "The New Sun" was much more coherent and compelling, but it was more like an interlocking set of novels than a single novel. It seemed to me that it was all a bit "spaced-out." This was not at all what I had expected from Robert E. Howard, although I'm a big fan of his work. I'm looking forward to reading the other volumes, especially the "H.P. Lovecraft" series (currently in progress, but well worth the read). I have always found "The Cthulhu Mythos" to be an engaging and engaging read, but if anything, the "New Sun" books have become a bit too "spat out" in their weirdness. I don't mind it when an author tries to write something different (even if it means doing something too weird), but this seems to have become an unfortunate habit for "The Books of Cthulhu."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about a very serious subject, the Holocaust. The author draws attention to what can be learned from a variety of sources about the Holocaust: The Jewish population of Russia is estimated to have dropped from about 2 million to 600,000 during the years of Bolshevik rule. Jewish children were taken from Jewish parents at gunpoint, and sent to Jewish orphanages. Jews were executed without trial. Women and children were systematically raped by German soldiers. And so on. Unfortunately, this is all the Holocaust can be about, since the subject was so poorly investigated and reported by both the Soviet authorities and the Allies. It is a pity that this book was not published in a more accessible form.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book I got to meet and learn about some wonderful characters. In particular, the author made the following observation in a review of the book " In one of the most intriguing passages in the book, Ariely writes about the psychological effects of the high cost of medical care: ''In a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health, it was found that people with chronic health problems (including asthma) were 2.5 times more likely than the general population to delay seeking health care. " If Arieley were to stop and think about this passage for a moment, he would probably have something to say about how that finding is relevant to the topic at hand. This is why it is so important to have great medical providers as role models. I believe that doctors are often so consumed with their own professional goals that they may neglect the patients they serve. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent overview of some of the basic principles of a practical way of solving problems.   I've tried many methods of solving some problems in my work, but this is hands down the best  I found for the problem I'm working on.  I know it's not easy and some people might be a bit scared or intimidated by it.  But it can be a very effective way of working with problems and it seems to work for a lot of people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book ever written on the history of the Korean-American community in New York City. The author is an insider, having lived in Korea since 1985 and written for The Korea Times since 1990. The book includes extensive interviews with the people she interviewed in New Rochelle, Queens, and Washington Heights, Brooklyn. She also includes personal accounts of Koreans living in the US and how she and her family fared in Korea. It is the author's personal account of Korean life that is most moving, and she writes with wit and heart. Her memoir also covers her time as a TV personality and her years as a journalist in Korea during the Korean War. A wonderful companion piece to the book, "Eunuch by Consent" is also available: http://www.amazon.com/Eunuchs-Concealed-Choice/dp/0375481287 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't own a Kindle, so I bought this one using an online bookstore.   It's well written and the pictures are very good.  It may not be a "classic" book, but it's good to have around if you need some motivation to move forward in your career. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book on self-improvement I've read. It is full of good information. It also has a lot of personal anecdotes. I learned many things from reading this book, such as that I am much better at things I did in high school, and that my father was the best father ever.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was interested in the author's other book,Â  " The Little Book of Positive Thinking   But was disappointed by this one. " I'm a sucker for self-help books, but this one isn't very interesting. Â  The author claims that in order to develop positive thinking, one must "think about thinking," but then goes on to state that "I just can't." She then goes into her "10 habits" which she says are necessary to create a positive thinking mind. My personal favorite is "Stop making excuses. You don't have to make excuses."  My point is that people who make excuses for themselves often are not thinking clearly. Â They will make themselves believe something is "impossible" or "unrealistic."  They believe their self-image is "too fragile" or their self is "not capable of it."  So their excuses become excuses for their failure.  They begin to believe that whatever they do has to be "good enough" because it is not "realistic"  It is easier to believe these things than to face reality.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can honestly say I never expected to find such a compelling book on the same subject! It has the potential to be one of the most profound and moving books on parenting.  The author, Dr. T. D. Stanley, is well-respected in her field as the author of a number of highly respected books on child development and child psychology.   She has written for many years on the topic of infant development.  Dr. Stanley was kind enough to answer a few questions I had regarding her book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a very big fan of both John Green and Danielle Steel. Their respective books are a must-read for anyone who loves to read and wants to improve their skills at writing.  Green's characters are very well developed and are very smart and well aware of the world they live in.  Steel's writing is elegant and smooth; her characters are a pleasure to read.  Both of these books have many references to other works of literature and movies as well. I am glad I had the opportunity to read them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent.  It shows that the Bible is very much worth taking seriously and that it is not just an interesting historical text with a few interesting lessons but is a very significant and powerful book with a lot of useful and relevant information. I have used the book frequently and have found it to be very enlightening and insightful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure if I've ever enjoyed a book quite so much as this one.  It combines the fun of a good mystery with the easy-to-grasp mysteries of a noir.  I would read it again in a heartbeat, but it's so short that I can't.  The author does such an amazing job of keeping things suspenseful and mysterious.  Even in a short book, you will definitely feel your pulse increase as you realize that something is coming.  You will have to work very hard to get the answers to the mystery.  While it's a perfect read for young adults, it still keeps things easy for older readers, and there is lots of adult humor. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really helpful in understanding the world around you.  This is not a world view you'll find in other books on this topic; it's an approach you'll only find in "Rethinking Narcissism".  I don't think the book could be written in one day; the author does a really good job covering so many subjects.  I was surprised at how much the book covered and was glad I bought it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a little late to the party, but I have to admit, this book is a must read.  The narrative is compelling and well researched.  I especially like the descriptions of the time the U.S. Air Force and Navy worked together to set up a "bounty" for Japanese aircraft.  For the Air Force, this is a good way to get planes back, but for the Navy, it meant getting an enemy aircraft off their hands.  It was a good time for the military and civilians, and an excellent way to end the war.   This book gives the Air Forces' involvement in the war in detail.  If you're interested in the story of Operation Olympic, it's a worthwhile read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of books written by authors with disabilities and I have enjoyed all the books by Jane Yolen.   This is my first experience reading one of Jane's books, and it has definitely been a learning experience.  I appreciate Jane's attention to detail and accuracy in her book.  My problem is that it is easy to write about difficult problems in simple, understandable language.  But Jane's way of writing can sometimes seem condescending and patronizing.  That is not the intent of her books, but it can come off that way when written by someone who is not disabled.  In one chapter, Jane wrote about her daughter being sent to a special school because her speech was so affected by a stroke she had.  Her daughter said she was glad she was going to a different school.  It was true that she was thrilled to be going to another school. Â  But Jane was not being compassionate.  She was being condescending because she felt her daughter was showing off her disability to impress the other kids at the school.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book.   It made me re-think and re-evaluate my faith in Christianity.  It gave me a lot of good information to work with in my own search for a deeper understanding of my faith. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book in an entire series on the History of Science that I have read. It is written in a clear and concise manner, with plenty of examples to show the validity of the ideas in question. The historical data, especially on the rise of Modern Science, is extremely accurate, as is the information on its scientific method and process of discovery. It has taken a long time for me to get through this book, but it is well worth the effort. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book!  I am a teacher and I have a small class of 5 to 10 students. I usually have 2 books in my classroom that I read in advance and the other ones I read when my students are ready. This book is a perfect fit for my class! It covers the basics of writing in a concise way.  This book was a complete game changer for me and I highly recommend it to others! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book on psychology I've ever read  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character is just a wonderful person, who is totally awesome in every way. He's witty, charming, well-educated, an amazing photographer, and is a loving father and a wonderful friend.  He's also a bit of a geek, but I think that's why he's a good dad and friend. I really enjoyed his perspective on family and love and what we learn about it through this book.  It's a great read, and you should definitely read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book about how to live your life as a trans woman.  It doesn't just talk about the "trans" part; it talks about the other stuff too, like depression, mental health, and even the effect it has on people (how trans women's bodies are so often mistaken for being men's).  There's so much information packed into this little book.  A little more writing about trans women, as well as trans relationships and the many different issues they face would have been great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a very good book. It's not as quick or easy to read as I would have liked, but it's not bad.  The writing is clear and to the point.   I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the topic of religion and morality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very taken by this book. It is filled with fascinating and relevant information about human behavior. The author provides his insights about the human mind in an accessible way. He uses a number of different methods in his research to demonstrate his points, which makes this an excellent book for an undergrad or graduate course on psychology. I recommend it highly for anyone interested in the human brain or its relation to behavior, especially in the context of the modern workplace.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was born and raised in India and was lucky enough to grow up in India before being exiled to the USA for a few years at the age of 11 for my brother's crimes. I feel as if I have been reborn into this country. The characters in this book were incredibly real and the world they lived in was so beautiful.  I've just read the book and have yet to decide whether I am going to buy the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been wanting to read an autobiography for a long time, but the ones I've found so far were all over the place, too self-serving, too negative or too positive.   Well, this book, at least the first two thirds, is all of those things.  Not only is it an excellent autobiography, it's also a great historical book.  I really enjoyed listening to him describe his experiences growing up poor in the South.  He talks about how it helped him to develop a strong work ethic and self-confidence and how it made him want to succeed in any kind of situation.  It makes sense, given how the South is run.  If you have a lot of money you don't have to worry about starving to death, you can take your time and think about things. It's nice to know that you're not the only one who got that way, even if you weren't raised in a rich family.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished   the third book in theÂ   Â Harry Potter   series  .  It was great.  I love the Quidditch stories in the   first two books and the first book was especially good.  The story here is just about the same  but is even better . It has a little bit of everything: Quidditching,   Harry's childhood,  a love triangle,  magic, witches, and   more.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book by accident on a trip to London.  I had been so anxious to read this book since hearing so much about it and had read so many reviews on it.  It wasn't until I had finished that I realized that I had also been looking for it but missed it. I have to say, I think I've finally found it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a college student who is not so good with foreign languages. I am also a beginner in history, so I found this book very helpful.   In it, the author makes the case that we have never had a true liberal democracy in history. He argues that the rise of democracy in the West began in Europe, but never really came to the United States.  I found that to be very persuasive.  His argument is based on an examination of American history.  This was my first attempt at research into the topic and I was very pleased with the outcome.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book, it was interesting and thought-provoking. It gave a great explanation of how the state of mind that we get into when we try to make sense of the world is influenced by our social groups and our culture. We are not all born equal and have the same abilities. We also have different experiences that shape the way that we think and act. When we are raised in a different environment or we move to a new town, we lose our identity and start to adapt to the new way of life. This book gives a great overview of this process, how it affects our thinking, and how we can change. I am hoping that I can one day be able to apply this knowledge in my own life to help me see the world more clearly and act more in accordance with my own values. This will be an interesting read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read The Good War, by Michael Ellenberg, at least a dozen times and I feel each time the same thing. It's like he is reciting the same lessons from his previous work: the evils of war, the necessity of the civilian population, the dangers of the state, and the necessity to work for peace. Ellenberg is very good at summarizing important ideas in a clear and concise way. There's a lot of good advice in the book. The Good Peace was his last book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read through all three books in the Star Wars   trilogy (and a couple of others) since I was a kid, so I'm really pleased that I've finally read   this one.   This book is much more serious and sophisticated than   the previous two, and I'm not sure I've ever read a book that so thoroughly captured the    essence of   Star Wars.  You really learn about the films, the characters, and   their place in the  universe. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! I had been struggling with infertility and it's not as simple as waiting around until you find the perfect thing to help your love life. My husband and I have tried everything and have been unsuccessful. This book made me realize that there are always options. There are no guarantees and everyone experiences the ups and downs with infertility. The book includes tips on how to manage your symptoms as well as how to be proactive. She goes on to share her experience of trying to get pregnant through IVF (and having a miscarriage) and also her experience trying to conceive naturally through natural birth. This is a very important read for anyone going through this exact process.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of the first few novels in the series and this one definitely tops it. I love how they are so quick and easy to read - the action and excitement just rolls right off the page.  It's also nice that they aren't overly sentimental about any one character. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a hard time putting this book down once I started it. The author's writing style is very interesting, and the information he provides is relevant to anyone interested in becoming an effective leader and a competent team player.  I plan on purchasing other books by the same author in the future, as well as his other books on leadership, and I'm especially looking forward to reading his "How to Start a Business" book, which will focus on business planning and management. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as an introduction to the Christian religion for my nephew and daughter. It was a real eye opener for them, and I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the Christian faith.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was an interesting read about the creation of the British empire.  The book starts with a chapter that discusses a visit by Sir Francis Drake to New Bedford, Mass.  In the book, Drake, a British naval officer, is the first white man to visit New Bedford in over 200 years.  Drake was interested in the region because he thought it could be an early port of call for a colony in the New World.  It took another 300 years before there were any black Americans to be bothered by this.  There are two sections in this book that are of interest.  First, there is a section on African slave owners in New Orleans.  This is a fascinating history that shows the impact of slavery on New Orleans culture.  Second, there's a section that discusses how the British captured the Congo from its native people.  I wasn't sure I liked the section on the Congo because it seems like the book is mostly about a war, but then again, it's not a war.  All in all, I think this book is a worthwhile read that could be used to teach students about colonial history.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pretty disappointed by this book. It is a good introduction to some of the more recent studies on self-esteem. It also includes a discussion of some of what's wrong with the current generation of self-help books, especially the ones with an emphasis on the importance of social skills.  While the book is definitely worth reading, there are several glaring omissions.  The first and most glaring is that it omits a lot of the research that shows that the negative self-talk people do is rooted in fear. In addition, the self-hate they express is often accompanied by acts of cruelty and/or physical abuse. I can't even begin to imagine what would make a person feel that they deserve or deserve to be treated this way.  Another thing that is missing is any discussion of how to help a depressed person. While there is discussion of "compulsive thoughts," "self-defeating behaviors," and "negative affect," the book fails to include any of the evidence that depression is caused by the same causes that lead to compulsive behaviors and negative affect, such as the death of a family member or a loss of a job. In a way, the book doesn't help people at all, but rather is another example of how people do more harm than good when they attempt to help others with depression.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my all time favorite books, and it is perfect for a rainy day.  I know from experience that the best way to start my day is by having a good read, and this is an excellent book in that regard.   I found the narrative style to be lively and informative, and I can't help but recommend this book to my fellow readers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was given this book at a college book fair in a trade-in package, and was glad I did. It was a well-written and entertaining book.  I enjoyed reading about the hardships of children in a poor family as well as the opportunities and rewards they got.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading the first chapter of Peter Thiel's best-selling manifesto "Zero to One", in which he warns against the dangers of overconfidence in technology. It's a good reminder that no matter how great your smartphone or computer is, the real value comes from our relationships and the people we trust.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been working on a book about the life of William Tecumseh Sherman for a few years. It has taken me a while to write because I had a lot of ideas about the character and why he was the way he was. I finally figured it out: he was a coward who wanted to be liked by his troops.   Sherman was a great general, but he was not a great man.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an outstanding introduction to modern Japanese. It introduces the language from the point of view of two modern Japanese men, Takashi Nakamura and Noboru Takagi. Takashi's work is the most important work on the history of modern Japanese language and culture. The book starts with his studies in college and includes his early experiences and experiments. He has some amazing stories about his adventures, including his first night in a Japanese hotel, a trip to a waterfall, and an evening in a traditional Japanese restaurant. He also discusses his work with the JÅyÅ shuppan, a language and folklore club. He discusses the importance of the "word", and how the "right" word is a key part of Japanese culture. He talks about the value of a good writing style and how it can make or break a Japanese language book. He goes into detail about the meanings of each kanji. I have always been interested in the history and origins of Japanese language. I am particularly interested in Japanese wordplay, but Takashi describes the history in a way that makes it easily digestible for anyone. There are some very cool photographs in the book as well. A couple of the photos are of Takashi playing cards with fellow members of the JÅ«kyÅ shÅpÅ. I particularly enjoyed his description of a typical JÅkyÅ dinner. One of the things that attracted me to this book is that the author includes so much historical background in his book. I was able to gain an understanding of some of the historical background behind modern Japanese grammar, and how its origins can be found in ancient Japanese languages. It is also great that the Japanese authors have provided examples of Japanese grammar that were not written down until many years after the Japanese language was created. It really made me appreciate the beauty of the writing system that has been used throughout Japan's history.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book so much that I bought it as an e-book.   It's a great introduction to the concept of "coding in a language different than that used to write the code."  It was particularly interesting to learn of the differences between Lisp, C, C++, and Java.  I am interested in learning more about programming languages as well.  The author is excellent at describing the language and it's features, with clear explanations that are easy to understand.  He doesn't try to explain everything, but explains what he can.  Although it's not a book about programming in a specific language, it is a great book on language and how it's used. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This book is a wonderful introduction to the subject of animal rights. I think anyone who thinks about animals from an ethical point of view has to read this book." âD. L. Ashby, author of The Human Animal "If I had never heard of animal cruelty from a non-vegan perspective, this would have been my first step toward veganism. It's a great idea to take a vegan to a zoo or an animal sanctuary.  " âJ. B. S. Haggard, author, editor, and animal welfare advocate "This excellent book covers an array of topics including veganism, animal rights, and the importance of nonviolence." âA. N. Whitehead, author and animal advocate "Brent Allen's book is packed with practical advice for a lifetime of compassionate living.  His book is the most in-depth and comprehensive animal welfare and environmental philosophy I have encountered." âJohn Holmstrom, author
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic that everyone who is a fan of good stories should read and be reminded that good fiction isn't always the stuff of wish fulfillment or fairy tales.  It's also a great novel in its own right. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book.  A couple of the characters I did not like and one I did, however, turned out to be interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed the book as much as I did the movie. Both books feature some of the most interesting research into the past that I have ever come across. Both were well researched and written.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am thoroughly enjoying this book.  It is very thorough, and I feel like I will be able to do a lot of the things the author mentions in her introduction (with the exception of the writing style), but do things more logically.  The book is definitely a work of passion for the subject, and a must-have for anyone who likes a good read! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A lot of good things have been said about this book (including by me)  This is a brilliant example of the way a person can take an entire genre and use it to tell a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent reference to the writings of Paul, with the same attention to detail and historical accuracy that one would expect from a high-quality modern classic.   There are two chapters on Paul's letters that, if you can get past their length, are worth the price of admission alone.  The first is an overview of Paul's life, from his childhood in Tarsus to the death of his wife and resurrection.  It's a wonderful overview of a complex and complicated man, and Paul's relationship with his wife, whom he never forgave for all the bad he said about her, is particularly insightful.  There's also a chapter devoted to Paul's "slavery and liberation" (p. 39) and another on Paul as "a missionary who changed the world" (pp. 54-5). Â  That last chapter is particularly interesting, since the apostle Paul is frequently credited with being the first to proclaim the Gospel to the Gentiles, a fact that he adamantly disputes. Â   The rest of the book is well-written and informative.  Although not perfect, this is an enjoyable reference that will serve its intended purpose well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have purchased this book from Amazon multiple times,  and each time I'm left satisfied by it.  I find it to be a well-written read,  full of historical information, interesting anecdotes, and personal reflections.  It is not a classic or a "must-read" but  a good, solid,  well-researched book that will keep you amused and informed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about how to manage your time to produce results and is particularly useful to entrepreneurs. In an age of too many distractions, this book is a must-have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have enjoyed all the books by Richard Paul Evans and found the writing quality and illustrations excellent. The subject matter can be a bit dry, but that is a very minor concern with most books on the subject, and I found the style of the writing very engaging. The illustrations were well done and provided lots of interesting information about the history of these animals.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. It is so fascinating to me how religion works to oppress women. The author shows that many modern religions, including Christianity, have tried to convince women that they have no choice in their sexual relations.   In the case of Christianity, women who are raped by a man are to be blamed for it, and even though the man's life was ended because of it, the woman is to be condemned for "turning to sin."  This book shows that this isn't just a myth, but a common myth, and it should be taught to children. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent example of how an author can combine a well-written narrative, an impressive collection of historical information, and a good plot to make a good read.  This is a great read for the historian in the house or for students of history.   The subject matter and the style are both very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was such an inspiration for my future writing, I've already got two other books on my to-read list.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because it's a popular, "re-tellings" book of the early church. I was curious to see how accurate these re-tells were. It turns out that many of them aren't even very good. The author doesn't even seem to know when the gospel was restored. He only seems to remember that he says that it wasn't. And so on. He also makes some pretty serious theological mistakes. And it's all in the second person.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you have not read this one yet, do yourself a favor and do so now. This is the perfect book for someone who is looking to read a good novel with a serious twist. The premise is interesting and believable, the characters are real, the writing is crisp and the stories are gripping. This book will stay on your bookshelf for a long time to come. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely love this book, and am enjoying it all the more for its thoroughness. It covers a broad range of subjects -- not just chemistry but also biology, chemistry in human affairs and biology in human matters -- and each topic is treated in detail and the authors' conclusions are drawn from that.  I'm still learning more about chemistry, and would love to learn more.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just finished reading this book and it has changed my perspective on the whole "war on drugs" thing.   The drug war really doesn't have anything to do with what we should be doing with drugs.  The real enemy is poverty.  It's a great book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. It's very well written and explains much about the history of the Jewish people, especially in Eastern Europe. I like that it addresses all three major groups that were expelled from their lands in the early 1900s: Ashkenazim, Sephardim and Romani.   Also, in addition to the chapters written by Jewish authors, this book includes two by non-Jews: one from the German Jewish community and another from the Ukrainian-Macedonian Jewish community. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had so much fun reading this novel and I'm going to keep looking for more to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most thought-provoking and well-written nonfiction books I have read in years. The author describes the history of the Soviet Union, the post-Soviet Russia, and the various political movements that developed in this period of transition.  The author has a great grasp of current events and gives very clear descriptions of the personalities involved.  While I've found many books written by scholars that are not very detailed about certain aspects of these events, this one was very detailed in its explanations of key issues.  This was one of those books that really forced me to re-evaluate certain historical events I had believed to be self-evident.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book, which is actually four essays on music by four distinguished musicians: Glenn Gould, Steve Reich, T Bone Burnett, and John Scofield, is an elegant, clear, and compelling exploration of the nature of musical art. Gould, as the title suggests, was very close to being a pop star (he even had a hit with the tune "You Make My Dreams Come True"), but he chose to focus on music as a medium of expression and transcendence. Reich, like Gould, is a classical musician who has transcended his own genre to produce works of tremendous complexity, beauty, and emotion. Scofield is a blues guitarist who is considered one of the greatest of all time. Burnett was a great jazz vocalist but has long been considered a master of his instrument and an innovator in the field. In this collection, they all share a common interest in music as art. The book is well written and the musicians are excellent interview subjects. I can't recommend it highly enough. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favourite book on the subject of religion and psychology is 'The Atheist Experience: Why You Think Atheists Are Crazy, But They're Not' by Dan Dennett.  He was the first to use the term "the atheist experience" in a serious article and the first one who used it in print.  This is, in fact, one of the reasons I started reading the philosophy of science series.  His book was really the first book on that subject, and I learned a lot by having my own "atheist experience." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was initially very put off by the title "A Good American Book About Race." My first reaction was, "Why would anyone pay money for something like that?" After some searching, I found a copy and gave it to my son who, by the way, is a huge fan of the late, great Martin Luther King. He was so impressed that he was going to order a copy for himself, and I was really worried about the fact that he would be disappointed. And, of course, he was! But the experience made me feel like it's worth it to try to understand the racial dynamics in America. The writing is excellent, the presentation of the data is excellent (well, the information on interracial relationships is not that important. It's the fact of how race affects interracial partnerships and families), and the historical context is very relevant. A lot of things we take for granted in our daily lives are the result of racial dynamics. The book covers a lot of interesting stuff. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of this book is about the rise of the modern secular movement. This is an interesting story, especially when you consider that the secular movement, itself, is relatively new. And I was surprised at how quickly the idea of secularism became mainstream. I'm a history buff, and the idea that the United States has changed so much in such a short time is interesting. But the idea at the core of this movement is interesting as well. While there has been much discussion of the dangers of religion, there's been little discussion of what religion can do to a society. In this case, the secularism movement was very effective in challenging the religious influence of the state and government. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading the new edition of The World War I Diaries, written by one of the best war correspondents ever to emerge, John McCrae. I had known McCraes from his early days as a freelancer for the Wall Street Journal; and when I heard he had written a book about his experience with the war, I went to see him in my office in the New York Public Library. He spoke warmly of his book and, with typical understatement, confessed that he was a lousy author. I thought this was funny, as McCra, in his own book, says that he "takes his chances" with his writing because he is "often wrong, but that's what makes it interesting." In the past, McCra has said that "he regrets making statements that are untrue," and that he prefers to "take a stand on some issues rather than give his judgment on the whole." So, how can he be a lousy writer when his own statements are so clearly wrong? And how can a book that purports to be "written in McCraed's signature style" contain so much inaccuracy?
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought this book was very well-written and well-researched. It takes a nuanced and sometimes muddled approach to women's lives and gives it a good shake. I like how it's a bit of a look at the complexities of women's roles as wives and mothers, but at the same time also tries to offer a positive picture of women in a patriarchal society. It does a good job of highlighting both the positive and negative aspects of women who have made different choices in this regard, such as Eleanor Roosevelt and her book, "It Takes a Village," as well as Barbara Jordan and her work, "What It Takes." It's not a definitive history of feminism, but it is a good introduction to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book on the history of the American Left.  It is very thorough and well-researched.  The authors do not only discuss the major Leftist movements in American history, but also their ideological differences.   They are also very clear about the fact that the American left is "at war," that it is bitterly divided on the question of what constitutes a just society.  This leads to the conclusion that it will be hard to build a successful political movement in America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Diving into a deep understanding of human behavior can be a very unpleasant experience."   This is the last book I purchased from the author.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the book and was given a bad review.  This isn't his first attempt at self-help.  He was very good at it in the past.  Instead of being good about it, however, he's doing it worse than ever.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing is crisp and the themes and topics are interesting.  I particularly liked the discussion of how the American economy is becoming less innovative and less entrepreneurial.  The book concludes with an important discussion of the role of the market in creating wealth and how its absence can stifle innovation.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really well written book, well researched, and well written. There are several references and examples to back up many of the ideas that it contains. The book also includes several interesting and useful facts about other religious groups, such as the Amish and Hutterites. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book on a recommendation from a friend. I had always been interested in Buddhism but had never read any Buddhist literature.  As a lifelong atheist, I never read much atheist literature, and as I was reading this I realized how much more interesting the Buddhist perspective is.  It's not about belief. It's about experience.  I'm interested in the scientific side of the story, but this book makes it about a profound sense of self, of a way of life, a way to live that's different from the rest of the world.  That's very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was completely taken by this book.  The first half tells the story of what happened when the US took over Korea in 1945. It has a realistic feel, and although I was aware of the events that occurred, I never really understood it. However, after spending a year in Korea as a journalist, I have a much better understanding of the history and Korean people's attitudes.  I also came away with a new understanding of why people in the US seem to hate the North Koreans so much.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book. It is one of the more well researched and written books on this very complex issue. It was a great surprise to see just how many people are having similar problems with their relationships with their children. In general, parenting has been the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. I'm a big fan of Michael Moorcock's work (particularly his fantasy work) and his books have always made me really want to read more of his work. I found this one to be very interesting, well written and engaging. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was looking for a non-fiction book that I could use as a textbook in my undergraduate class on philosophy of mind.   The book's subtitle (a summary of the central thesis of the book) was also perfect:  "Philosophical Foundations of the Psychology of Self-Consciousness."   This is a good overview of the field and is especially helpful for students who need to know more about these central topics before taking graduate courses in philosophy of self. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a book which has helped me immensely in a time of intense need for personal development.  The first several chapters are very good at introducing you to the main themes of the book.  It then builds upon these themes in a much more effective manner.   I especially liked the discussion about the value of having a purpose or calling in life.  At times, the author seems to be talking about something as personal as one's sex drive but really I think it's a more general concept about a life which is truly meaningful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book.  I had never heard of Pankratz before but read his blog and I was intrigued.  He has a way of making a point without getting lost in the details.  After reading it I was able to relate to some of the situations that Pankatz described.  Some of the details were very eye opening to me. I feel like he was able  to put into words the feeling of an overwhelming feeling of dread that one can get when one is confronted with a problem at work.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was able to finish this book in less than a month. I really enjoyed the idea that the human body had an innate ability to heal, and in fact that it could even improve the physical condition of the patient. It was interesting to learn more about how this works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must-read for any serious student of the Hebrew Bible.  It deals with such topics as the Old Testament patriarchs and the Jewish exodus from Egypt, the prophets and their writings, the Messiahs and their prophecies, and the fate of the chosen people. The book is also well-written, engaging, and a real pleasure to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I didn't read this book until recently. I was not looking forward to it. I've always been a bit of a loner, but in high school, the social scene took over so that became my entire social life.   The book described a high school party that was so insane, it ended up in the papers. It was the wildest party ever and so many people died. I had never heard of anyone getting in a car accident at a highschool party and dying, but the book described it like it was a common event. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the way Dr. Johnson describes the world he grew up in. It's a small town, very hard-working. He says that he grew on a hill above the railroad tracks, and was very aware of his existence.  His family wasn't rich, but they always did well and were always there when he needed them. The only problem was that the Johnson children had lots of problems - a bad parent, bad siblings, bad teachers and a bad neighbor.  I think that's what drives Dr. Johnathan Johnson in his story, because he never lets anything get in the way of him living his life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was good, I was reading the summary and thought it said that it was the first book in the series, but I found the book to be the second half of a trilogy. So, I finished the trilogy.  It's good, it tells the story, and that's about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good, well-written book about the problems with modern society and the solutions proposed by some of history's most insightful individuals. This is the type of book that is perfect if you're looking for something to help you better understand your own history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book, while I had the first of my three-year "researches" into Chinese food, and it was just as good.  I've been a bit puzzled as to why Chinese food has so little attention in the American cuisine world, but I guess it's because the focus is more on other things, like Americanized cuisine or fast food or comfort foods.  However, I find it easy to love Chinese food in general, so I will definitely be looking for a new book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good introduction to a fascinating subject. It covers the historical, scientific, and technological aspects of the human body very well. It also includes a number of exercises for physical, mental, and emotional self-improvement. This book will be of value for both lay and professional readers alike."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book very interesting.  From a religious perspective, this is a good example of the "no-blessings" of prayer.  It's about a man who believes he's going to hell, and when he goes to the local Methodist church for a prayer, is given a blessing which he takes and believes will make it all go away.  The trouble is, it didn't work.  After a few years, the man is still there.  He still goes to church, and is still told that prayer doesn't work - at least not for him.  I'd also like to point out that some of the most interesting parts of this story come from the fact that it's just a man believing things that are wrong.  There's no need to give him the blessings he doesn't want, no need for the Methodist Church to be there, no reason for it to be so well-equipped with equipment.  You really feel for him, and want him to be happier. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the kind of book I could not wait to devour: it is a thoroughly entertaining account of the history of a very specific cultural phenomenon, with no pretense of a larger historical narrative or grand overarching themes. The chapters are well-written and thoroughly researched, and the analysis is always compelling.   I found myself constantly thinking about my own history in light of the various themes and insights contained in the book.  For example, I have no idea why I did not notice the connection between the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire and the decline of the Middle Ages until reading this book. It is certainly an interesting thought. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book does a good job of giving us an overview of the evolution of the human and primate nervous systems over time. It is not just about how our own nervous systems evolved, but how other animals' evolved too. This is an excellent book that I think will be extremely useful to a wide range of people.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was given this book at the suggestion of a friend. I love books about the paranormal. I am also interested in researching the subject. In my research I read several books. In this one, the author discusses a recent case in which the deceased had not been identified. I was intrigued so I downloaded a copy of the book and read it. The author makes a very good case as to why this case is not typical.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful and well-written book that not only discusses the history and practice of the ancient medical arts, but also shows the practical application and benefits of such practices in our modern world. I have never read anything like it before." Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:   I finished the first book in this series in a week, and was glad I did because the second book was just as good.  I found the characters' reactions to situations extremely believable, and their thoughts about what they'd learn from it were also very insightful.  There were a couple of times when I was thinking about how they might react if they had to face such a situation in real life, and it gave me a good chuckle. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a great fan of the book series, and enjoyed reading the two newest books so much that I'm actually going to reread them.  I've just finished "A Witch Shall Be Born" and I am enjoying it more than the first two.  For me, the plot has a bit of a twist at the end.  A very nice ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book a lot. It contains a lot of information on various medical conditions and treatments, and I have also found many references to medical information on medical textbooks.   While there were some parts of this book that were boring, I would recommend it to everyone looking for more information on health issues or a good introduction to medical books.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. It is written in a clear and entertaining style and is a great primer on how to conduct business.   My recommendation?  If you want to be more in touch with your customers, you need to learn to talk about your products in a way that draws them in.  When I used to work for a large mail-order company, it took me a couple of weeks to learn how to "brand" and sell my products.  This book demonstrates that the same process can be applied to business in general, and that being able to do this well makes a huge difference to your bottom line.  Highly recommended!
Write a positive review about a good book:   A well-written novel that is a good mix of fiction and history.   The novel's first half is written from the perspective of the main characters and is more fiction than historical fiction.  The first half also has some minor historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies that need to be brought to light.  There are a few other historical inaccurancies, however, the main one being that many of the characters are actually fictional characters from history. I would give the book 4.5 stars, however if you want a good historical fiction novel, you might want to check out " The Black Company: A Novel of the American Revolution."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book a couple of years ago, but just never got around to finishing it.  I think I had been trying to read more fiction.   When I finally finished reading, I was pleasantly surprised.  The story itself is well done.  It is definitely not the story of a girl and her dog but of two people trying to adjust to life after a divorce.  In fact, I found it a little sentimental, like when a parent loses a child.  When the father is away at work and the mother is at home, the husband is a bit of a loner.  He doesn't enjoy interacting with the kids, and does not seem to be much of a family man either.  She's quite content to be left alone to do what she does best.  Even if she is quite self-centered, I can't help but be impressed at how she manages to get out of her own way.  A friend of mine has also recently lost a close family member.  Although they were separated for many years, the loss had a profound effect on her as well.  They never got along after her husband died, but she's doing quite well today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fine collection of essays on the history of the American West. Some of the essays are brilliant, while others are merely interesting. They're all interesting enough, and the collection is worth reading for its insight into American culture, and its emphasis on the idea of a West that is uniquely American.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this book a few years ago, but have since forgotten all about it. I was disappointed, but I picked it up again just last week and enjoyed it. This book is a classic in its own right; it explains the mechanics and principles of writing effectively and persuasively. It's a quick read (in just a few hundred pages), and very easy to follow. It should be required reading for anyone who writes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book for fun. It was my first introduction to feminism and to the work of women's studies.  I'm an American and don't consider myself a feminist. I believe we should value the talents and talents of women but don't want to make the mistake of thinking that only women are smart or capable.  This book made me see feminists as equal in every aspect. I'm glad I took the time to read this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this is one of the very best books on Mormon history and the Book of Mormon that I have read in the past decade. I have found myself re-reading this book many times over the years. I read the book years ago and was so impressed with the authors' careful research, their deep knowledge of the Mormon religion and its history, and their understanding of how the church evolved. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my mind, the best book on history I've ever read is Anthony Sutton's The Fall and Rise of the Third Reich. I bought it on the recommendation of a good friend, but after getting through it in one afternoon I couldn't resist the urge to read another book by Sutton, which he's written about the Great Depression. So I'm now reading a biography of the great New York Times journalist, Pauline Kael, about her reporting on the McCarthy hearings. The Kael books are among the best biographies I've read. The Great Depression isn't quite as good, but it's a decent first effort. I like that Sutton shows that there are some things we just can't figure out, even when we don't have "the answers." And I like the fact that Sutton writes from the perspective of a writer who's had to live through the period, rather than a journalist who happened to be there when it was happening. This book should be required reading in the English departments of every American university.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been enjoying John Irving's books for years now, and I have yet to find a book that so clearly and accurately captures my feelings about his works. I'm a fan of books about the American South, and "The Book Thief" (a novel, not a play) captures my experience well. My favorite part of the book is when Irving talks about how he's seen so many black folks go to prison:  "This is the way the South has always behaved." He notes the similarities between that attitude and the Jim Crow era, but argues that the Southern way has "progressed" since then. I was impressed with his ability to point out how white Southerners still seem to believe in the superiority of their way of life. The "lack of education" is a big part of this belief.  This is what I loved most about "The Case of Jim Crow." It gave me a better understanding of how so many Southerner's view Jim Crow and the way it was enforced. I hope that as we move forward in the 20th century, the South will move away from that system.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have loved every single one of the books in the Young Adult series by Robin McKinley.  This is the second in the series, and it feels very fresh and interesting.  McKinley has a unique voice that is very interesting to listen to, but also easy to relate to.  I like how the characters are always relatable, even though they don't always do what they want.  It's a great, positive read that I recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've loved this book from the first moment I opened it. It's like a time capsule of the golden age of adventure novels and fantasy: the wild, adventurous, humorous characters, the great dialogue, and the gorgeous artwork that brought so many of the characters to life. The writing is excellent. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the characters aren't always in perfect health or completely sane, and their actions are just as rational as we can expect them to be. There's also a great amount of romance (which I found fascinating), but not nearly so much as I expected it to be (probably because the authors were only interested in one kind of love). Overall, it's an exciting adventure and I look forward to reading more from the authors, hopefully including the second book in the series!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book more than I expected to. It is well written and has many good examples, but it is still short on actual knowledge and has a surprising number of outdated or inaccurate concepts.  I recommend this book to everyone who wishes to know more about a topic that is important, but often misunderstood.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a classic. It is the definition of "novelty" and has sold millions of copies. There is nothing like it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book because I like fantasy books.  It's not just an old fashioned epic fantasy novel.  The prose is clear, the world is well-developed and believable.  There is a good pace and it is hard to get too lost in the storyline.  I do like the characters.  One of the main characters is a woman who is not afraid to take charge.  She does well in the world and is a great addition to the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is short and very informative.   It is in German and English.  I like the fact that you include important background about the Cold War and the Holocaust.  It was very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was absolutely brilliant.  I had a wonderful time reading it.  It was funny, moving, informative and thought provoking.  For the first time ever I am feeling like I actually know something about something.   I also liked the fact that most of the information was about "what not to do."  The author was able to describe some things that I didn't even know were bad ideas.  If you want to really know something, this book is perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely love this book. It is well written and provides so much information on a variety of topics that I felt a little overwhelmed at times. I'm an older male and I feel like I don't have the energy for a lot of things. I do have a certain interest in cooking and cooking has always been one of my favorite things to do. This book has given me a way to make good food in my own home. It's been extremely helpful in allowing me to explore what I don,t know and get my feet wet in an area I am interested in.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's very short. I thought it was going to be a lot longer than it is. I have been waiting for a book like this for some time. I'm reading it now and I have to say that there are some good stories in there.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book a lot and found that it had a lot to say about the relationship between men and women. The book, written by a professor of sociology, is very informative and thought provoking.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading the works of Stephen King for a long time. In this one I didn't like the character of Derry as much as in some other King books. It seemed too much like the same character that had appeared in several other books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have always loved the books by Michael Crichton.  They've always held a special place in my heart, and the final book in the trilogy, _Jurassic Park_   is still one of my favorites.  Crichon is able to capture the heart of the story while maintaining the tension of the previous two books.   He also captures the characters' inner lives and how they evolve over the course of the book.  I'm glad I read this novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a brilliant, funny and compelling book.  The story is really interesting and so is the way the author captures that time and place.  It's very easy to read, a quick read.  I highly recommend 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea of the book is a good one. It starts out with a couple of characters that have a troubled past and have no one in their lives to turn to. They decide to go to the park to play. The main character finds himself lost and unable to find his way back, eventually giving up and falling asleep on a bench. It is as if the park is a trap that will leave him without a way to survive. He wakes up with a strong sense of foreboding about what lies ahead, but the characters try to convince him that he shouldn't give up hope. They try to encourage him to keep moving forward even as they have their own obstacles. Eventually, the plot really gets interesting when one of the characters starts to turn on the others. He is a dangerous character who uses his abilities to get what he wants. I thought this was interesting and I think it has much to offer people with psychological problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It's an amazing look at life in ancient Greece from a feminist perspective.  The author describes the problems of Athenian women in this society well. I've been reading a lot about ancient Greece, and the problems with how women were treated in that society.  It's interesting to hear how women viewed themselves and how they dealt with them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Fable" is a wonderful retelling of the "Fables" by H. P. Lovecraft.  It is written from the perspective of a character who is trying to understand and comprehend their life and relationships, and is helped along by the fables themselves.  Even if you don't know much about the Cthulhu Mythos, this book will give you a much better idea about how to approach that topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was initially not sure about this book, as I have heard nothing but great things about the original book. The one problem I had with the book is that it is not very readable. However, after reading the book, I have been very impressed. The descriptions of the events in the book are accurate, and there is a wealth of information in the background and history surrounding the events. The information is presented in a way that does not distract from the story or the people who are being discussed. The book includes numerous photos of all of the people and their belongings, many of which are very informative, and most of the pictures are very nice and interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a long time reader of Jane Austen, but after a year of rereading The Complete Novels by Catherine Morland, I am starting to think that it is her novels that I love best. I am not alone, either. Austen's books have been on my "to read" shelf for over 15 years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fantastic!  The book, while being about psychology, is not just about psychology.  It is about human relations.  Psychologists and other academic researchers are quite often ridiculed for their lack of knowledge and expertise about real people, and how their ideas about what constitutes a person or character are inaccurate or incorrect.  The authors take a different approach.  They spend almost every paragraph explaining how a particular individual or group feels about something.  This is extremely difficult for non-experts to understand, but the authors make it very clear that the feelings that the character is feeling are real feelings.  In addition, these feelings are also frequently expressed in the third person, making it easy for the readers to know what is going on in the character's mind.  I found the descriptions in each chapter extremely helpful.  For example, the first chapter deals with how different people react to death.  A man, who is very religious, tells the reader that he has had a lot of trouble with his children after their father died.  He feels that he is "possessed" by the spirit of the deceased, and that the children should not have to be reminded that their father is no longer with them.  As a therapist, I found this information to be very helpful, and I think that people who have problems with their own religious beliefs should also learn about the feelings of others.  Finally, there is a chapter about a woman who feels that people will eventually start to think that her husband is a fraud, and she is concerned that people might start to find out that she is not what she appears to be.   The following chapter describes how the author was able to cope with her doubts about herself, her husband, and her faith, and eventually learn to love God and her husband for who they are.  Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an important introduction to the history of women's rights and liberation.  It's a very detailed, scholarly text about the history and current struggles for women's freedom in the US and around the world. Â I found myself becoming even more interested in these issues as I learned more about the people, places, and events that were key to their struggle.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   A book of essays from the perspective of students and teachers that attempt to explore the nature of good education is a rare find. Many of the essays in this volume are good essays that touch on important questions about education. Some are much better than others.  This is a must have book for anyone interested in the nature and history of schooling. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book of Unwritten Tales is a collection of short stories. In it, there is a boy named Sam, who has lost his mother and has come to live with his grandmother in rural Ohio. One day, Sam and his grandmother are driving past a farmhouse and stop to check out a mysterious man walking around in the middle of the night. Sam sees the man walking in the dark, so he follows him into the woods. They find a giant stone creature that had been laying there for years, but it seems to be growing back. Sam thinks the giant stone may be the spirit of his dead mother, but his grandmother says that it's something else entirely. The two set out to look for the Giant Stone, but Sam and the creature seem to be in danger. The creature attacks Sam and almost kills him, but the giant boy saves Sam and they both get away. The rest of the story takes place as Sam's grandmother drives him to school. It's a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a recent podcast interview (listening to a man discuss his work of fiction, not fantasy or science fiction), I was reminded of the story of one of my favorite writers, Douglas Coupland.  In this story, there is a young man who is a good student and who finds himself drawn into a very strange fantasy world: The fantasy world was not an afterthought; it was a deliberate decision to create. The fact that this particular world was "real" was an added bonus.  He didn't just throw on some magic and go on his way; his characters could do and say whatever they wanted. And they did, constantly. Even after they realized what they were in, they were so absorbed in what they wanted to do that it seemed unreal.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed a lot of Jane Austen's books but this is by far my favorite.  I love the subtle but powerful language in which Austen explains her characters' thoughts, beliefs, and desires, and the way the book progresses from one character to the next in the light of their thoughts and actions.  The book also takes place in England in the late 17th century and the characters' reactions to the time period are fascinating.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy science fiction, I highly recommend it.  The story is clever, and it makes you think a lot about how society would behave in a society where people are treated as autonomous individuals rather than as things to be exploited.  While it's definitely not going to change your life, the thought-provoking ideas presented in the book are certainly worth pondering. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! I grew up reading these type of books - like the ones that I grew to love from the mid-70's.  These were the books that helped me to develop my own critical thinking skills.  If you are in the process of learning how to think for yourself - this is a book that should be read and discussed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am an academic and the last book I read about the great European classical composer Gioachino Rossini was not very helpful.  In fact, I feel that it was designed more to prove that Rossini is not as great a composer as he is usually said to be.  For example, he is said to have had a bad first love and he's frequently said to dislike girls.  He's even said to prefer boys to girls. What's more, the book claims that Ross in fact liked both boys and girls. That is just not so.  Instead, Rossini loved only girls. In his first love, he was unable to control his own emotions, so he ended up leaving his love and marrying a girl he met in a Paris dance club.  Once he got over that emotional problem, however, Ross became totally infatuated with another girl, who was a dancer.  The end result of their first love was Rossini marrying a woman he met at a ball.  So, while he was infatuation with both girls and boys, he only married the girls because he didn't want to lose his girl.  And in the case of Rossini's first love's death, he felt so sad and guilty about his inability to control emotions that he decided he had to marry the girl, despite her refusal.  It is just a terrible shame that this book made me think Rossini wasn't as great as he was generally told to be, especially since Rossini wrote two of the greatest opera works of all time.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was surprised and happy to read this book as it was recommended to me by someone I know. I was also interested in her previous book, What to Expect When No One's Expecting.  Although the writing style and content seem similar, what she writes about in that book was much more relevant to what I wanted to know.  The book also provides helpful advice on how to cope with stress and how to learn from mistakes.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend  "The World as We Knew It"  The original text was the most important thing I learned as a child. "This book is the most powerful, lucid, and profound presentation of science in one book I have ever read." ~ David J. Schubert "It is the best book ever written on science and its relationship to culture. A wonderful antidote to the scientism that pervades modern American culture." ~ Richard A. Stern, author of How to Read a Books
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book about the evolution of language: one of the first to explain how language is both a product of evolution and culture. The author is a great interviewer/interrogator (and she is also a great interviewee).  She is also really good at explaining complex concepts in terms that people already know.  I found her discussion of language acquisition fascinating.  Her approach (which is different than that of linguists in general) is to understand what makes language different from other animal behavior (e.g., if a lion eats its young) and then think about why humans have language, rather than thinking in terms of how we are unique (e like lions do).   The book also includes lots of examples of how language can be used by animals, and why they would prefer not to use it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a well-written collection of articles on modern society. The author is concerned with how the "new normal" is affecting society as well as the average person. This book has lots of good articles that discuss issues such as education, entertainment, and social acceptance. The topics are not only interesting but also relatable, so even a non-expert in the area can learn something from reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I ever read a book from a good-to-great author was a few years ago.  In the first couple chapters, David Baldacci was just a fascinating and original character. I'd like to say I had fun with his stories as well, but I found some of the descriptions of the people around him to be a little harsh. The writing didn't do this, but the characterizations were.  The narrator was one of those that I'd love to read myself as I do not want to sound pretentious. He was a fascinating man, and I was enjoying the stories he was telling.  After that first read, I'm curious to read Baldacci's next few books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have just finished John McPhee's excellent book. It covers much material that would have been in a college course on economics (and on other related topics). McPee does a very good job of showing how the problems in the modern economy are much larger than anyone has been willing to accept, and how they affect everything from individual decisions to corporate behavior.  The book is very thorough, and is well written. The author makes his case through what he calls "The Big Picture." This is a general description of the economy, and applies to a wide range of topics. In each chapter the author presents the Big Picture and explains why it is important. In many cases, I agree with him. In others, I find his explanations wanting. However, in all cases, he makes his points and gives us an alternative perspective.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am reading a nonfiction book on the "history of atheism." It is a very interesting and well-written book that covers a lot of interesting subjects. But it has one huge, glaring error: the book makes no mention of the most important atheist book of all time: The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins.  I agree that the book is not good, but it is not an embarrassment either.  In fact, it is an excellent book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book so much that I decided to give it 5 stars.  The main theme is the nature of change.  Change, to the author, is either a good or bad thing.  To the extent that change is positive, it is beneficial.  However, there is a downside to change. A downside that can be perceived in a negative light by some (the people who want it) and a positive way by others (the person who wants to avoid it).  When change is either good or evil, it either causes good things to happen or bad things to occur.  This is a theme that occurs in the book a lot.  It is the main theme of the book.  Sometimes change is necessary.  In the end, it isn't necessary.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so glad I picked up this book. I've always enjoyed reading about the history of medicine, especially medicine in developing countries. So many of the topics presented here have been fascinating to me as a reader, and I'm excited to get into it more with this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this very interesting book to be a more positive than negative review of the work of a religious historian. I found myself thinking, "You know, it's interesting to see how a historian's work is often influenced by his religion and how, often, he is able to reconcile this with his faith." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am still a big fan of the books by Susan Orlean and John Irving, even though they have become more of an artform for me, even with my new book, I am going to read more Irving.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was skeptical about a book that talks about being attracted to "unconventional" people. It seemed to be a book for people who want to "grow up and get married" so to speak. But the stories and the stories themselves were compelling. The author is a really nice, smart woman who has been able to successfully navigate these two cultures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently finished reading The Unbeliever's Guide to the Universe.  I found it to be an excellent companion to my book on faith and the Bible.   As I read the book, I was struck by the fact that, in its original conception, the guide was a work of religious apologetics.  As one of the main points of the book is to show that we must "follow the evidence," the introduction and many of the questions at the end of the guide are very much like questions asked by Christians in the face of evidence that they are wrong.  Yet, as I read through the book and the questions and answers, I couldn't help but think that the guide would be a very good thing for atheists, since it would show them where their beliefs are wrong, and how we can get a good start on the search for truth.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so thrilled to read this book and I am so grateful that my bookstore has brought it to me. I had never read anything about the Korean people and now I'm a little bit more knowledgeable about the history of Korea and Korea's relationship with China. I also want to thank the authors for making this possible: the work that the Korean government is doing to preserve Korean culture and language is great. And the information that is being published in English is good for people like me who have never read this kind of material before. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book so much! I've been teaching a course for a while about science and the history of science, and there's always a bit of a gap between the actual sciences and the historical sciences.   This book really made a lot of sense.  There's really a huge gap between what people thought the sciences were like in the middle ages, and what we now know about them.  The book discusses several different periods in history, all with a similar pattern.  Then it goes on to discuss historical theories about the nature of these scientific ideas, and how these theories were not just wrong, but actually actively harmful to progress in the sciences. It was fascinating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the absolute best I've ever read on the topic of human history. It presents a wide-ranging and thorough study of the ways in which humans have interacted with the world throughout history, from the earliest days of farming and gathering to the modern era. I've been trying to come to some kind of conclusion about what human nature is since I took my last biology course. The ideas presented in the book have given me a framework to understand my own history in a much more complete and consistent way. This is my first ever reading in an academic book, so I'm still finding my footing and it may take me a bit to get to the nitty gritty, but I have no hesitation in recommending this to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not only a good introduction to the history and theology of the Orthodox Church in America, but also a good primer for those of us interested in the future of this movement in America.   The book is accessible to people with no prior knowledge of Orthodoxy.  The author's style is clear and easy to follow.  There are numerous pictures throughout the text, including pictures of holy icons.  I also liked that she included an appendix with translations of many of the prayers in the New Testament that are said in the Orthodox rite (i.e., prayers for our departed loved ones). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really enjoying this book.  The writing is simple and clear and the ideas are relevant.  It's an excellent summary of important concepts.  If you're just getting into the field and want some solid background, this is a good place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read this book, but I have to say, I wasn't a fan. This book starts off with a brief synopsis of the book's story, then the book spends about 30 pages explaining how that story is the main focus. It was soooo boring. And I'm not talking about the writing; I mean the "explaining" part of the story. The premise of the plot (the protagonist is a woman who discovers she is not the biological mother of a biological child) is so contrived it made me laugh. Not to mention, the woman is not even remotely believable. I don't care who you are, but this book is ridiculous and just makes you want to toss it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first chapter set the tone for the rest of the book perfectly. I had read that I should read a book in which the author argues the case for and against "the status quo." It had struck me that the author's position was both strong and well stated. I hadn't fully realized that until now.    I've always been a fan of political science and the authors in this collection were especially sharp. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend    It's a very interesting look into the world of the mafia through the eyes of the criminals themselves, 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a lot of books about sex and relationship issues, but I always think of this book as being one of the better ones. It's funny, honest, and funny in a good way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the most amazing thing I have read in years. It contains the most fantastic stories, the most incredible insights, and the most important lessons. I was totally lost with how much the author has to say about so many things (and not in a bad way).   It's a beautiful book and I'm glad that I've finally gotten to finish it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think the book is very well-written, with all the important points presented. I am not a lawyer, but I do have some experience in this area. There are plenty of good tips to be found in this book, and the authors are honest about their own experiences. It's good to have this type of writing advice out there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received this book as a gift and I have to say that I am delighted.   This book is a superb introduction to Islam and its history.  It is also filled with valuable historical information, from which you will learn much about the development of Islam.  I learned about the beginnings of Islam, Muhammad's life, the Qur'an and the Hadith.  The book is also very thorough, both in explaining the meanings and details of Islamic religious practices, as well as historical accounts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's not the kind of book that you can tell to others about your favorite book or that it'll change your life forever.  It isn't even really the kind that you want to buy for the sake of "being nice" or "having a great book."  It is, however, the kind you want when you're waiting for that train to come by.  I waited for a train, and the train arrived just as I finished it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't want to go on about the details of this book so I'll just say that I loved it, even though it didn't make a ton of sense at times. It's not just that it tells me, I'm a woman, and this book is going to make me think differently about myself, but it's also that it gives me something to think about. It gives me the chance to look at a problem that has plagued me for quite some time. To quote the title of the book, it's important for people to be allowed to make mistakes. I've tried to understand what makes people tick, but to no avail. I thought I understood that I had an attraction to men, but I never got any of the wayward or inappropriate sexual thoughts. I knew I was attracted to men when I was younger, but that's the extent of it. I was told it was "in my head" or "in the brain," but I'm pretty sure it wasn't. I still want a sex change, but until I do, I have to live with a problem I have no hope of ever solving. This book gives me an opportunity to do so, and I will cherish it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read for all those who study Asian history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was skeptical at first, but I got it and read it in one day. I like the "bad" side of history better than the "good" side. The "bad side" is often much more interesting than the good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a big influence on me and I am grateful that I read it early on in my career.   It has always been my favorite non-fiction book on the subject of parenting, and I can't get enough of it.  It is very clear and easy to follow, and it's the kind of book that is so enjoyable to read that it often keeps me up late at night. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so good, it will be my first choice for any self-help book I buy this summer.   It's easy to read, full of insights and examples, and it's not hard to implement the principles.  I can't recommend it more highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book immensely and learned a lot from it.  The concept of a "culture of poverty" is the topic of discussion as the protagonist learns to use the skills he gained in the military to get by in a non-traditional environment, which isn't always the best way to get rich.   It's interesting to see the impact of having people around him learn about his military career but not him as a person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books. It will bring you up in time to celebrate with your family and friends when you find a good cookbook you've been wanting to read for a long time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books. It is a very practical guide for a woman who wants to have a child. It has practical advice and a lot of it is very helpful, including information about birth control. I got the book just before I was due to have my first baby, and it saved me a lot 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a bit skeptical, but I'm glad I gave it a try.  This book is a must-read for anyone who's interested in the effects of the war on children and their families.  The war was an "earth shattering" event that profoundly altered the American culture and the American psyche.  And it was a disaster for children and families. The children of soldiers (as well as their families) were damaged beyond recognition, and the war's aftereffects on American society is hard to overstate.  For example, the number of American children living in poverty has increased dramatically since the war ended.  One cannot overstate the damage that the war did to the American image of itself.  Even before the war, Americans were worried about the threat of Bolshevism and Communism, but after the war the worry turned to the "threat" of the Red menace.  Americans also found it impossible to believe that a nation that was the greatest capitalist power in the world could be defeated.  After all, the Soviet Union had "spent more than thirty years building a large and powerful military machine."  When the Red Army attacked the "Greater East" (a region extending from the Arctic to the Pacific Ocean, including China), the American public had no reason to believe the worst.  But when the Red offensive was defeated, the United States' "mighty" military and economic might looked like a joke.  I wish that more people had read this book before the Cold War ended.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and I decided to make a book that would help others with terminal illnesses. This book is so well written and well thought out that I have actually had a few conversations with people about their illnesses. I've always said that I was one of those people who was a "sick person's sick person." I'm not just talking about being sick from the cold and flu. I'm talking about a disease that affects your emotional and spiritual health. I had a major breakdown about 2 years ago because of my illness and my depression. I still feel really bad about it, but if it weren't for this book, I probably would have never found my way back to sanity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a great time reading the book "Lives That Change Lives" by Susan D. Smith and Mary E. Mears. It is the best book on how people deal with death that I have come across.   The authors use many examples and examples to illustrate their point.  Here are just a few:  "If we look at the history of religious communities that have dealt with death, they often have had some kind of a tradition that they should go to a certain place and have a certain ritual. Â  For example, the Roman Catholic church had a death rite that they called the "Mass for the Dead."  As the authors describe it, it is essentially the Mass for the Living. Â  The Mass is said to bring the dead back to life.  That is, in theory, what happens at Mass.  "There are other ideas that are similar in a more formal way to the Mass of the Living." The author, Susan D Smith, provides an excellent introduction to the life of a priest:  "[He] is the priest for the dead."   "They are not going to be dead forever.  But they are going to remain in the Church." Â  "So, as a priest, you have a unique place in the spiritual life of your people.  It is not to be confused with, say, being the Bishop of the Church or the Pope."  "One priest will not make a big difference, but I think it is good to have some priests." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much.  It is well-written and interesting.  The chapter about the famous "Coffee Club" is a good example of the types of things that can be learned from a bad coffee order:  The idea that some people are not wired to be polite is just plain false.  A few years ago I attended a "Cafe des Amis," an informal social gathering of French intellectuals.  All of the participants were polite and respectful; but none of them actually ordered a "coffee with cream."  I think the reason for this is that the cafe had a small but well-stocked bar; none of the coffee connoisseurs wanted to pay the full price.  I can understand this; it is not fun to have a coffee with cream, but sometimes it is unavoidable.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really solid and readable introduction to a subject I was familiar with only by the second volume of the New York Times best seller series, but was intimidated by at the outset. It introduces the central figures of the debate and their ideas, and is well written and interesting. I like that it shows that the science is not settled but that it is a process that is being continuously updated by the same team of experts who have worked on it for over two centuries. This is the most important book on the subject, but this is no substitute for actually reading the relevant work.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can think of a number of books I wish I had written, but unfortunately, this is the one I have to write:  First, it is a book about the end of the world and not a book with many examples of the human response to disaster. That being said, this book did a wonderful job of making me feel very much like a reporter covering a natural disaster in a small city in Mississippi.  I'm no expert, but it sounded like there were a lot of people in the building that got swept away.  Also, the ending, although not an exact science, is a really nice thought:  "I'll think of something," the narrator says.  That reminds me of the book I am reading at the moment: The World Made By Hand: A Tale of the Make-Believe Factory by Chris Bachelder.  (See my review of that book for more details on the end-of-the-world ending.) 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very well-written and well-researched book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a lot of fiction in my youth, and a number of them have stood out as special. This is one of them. The story is funny, the writing interesting, and the characters well-drawn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about a year ago and it has never left me. I remember being really impressed with it when it was originally published. It is a very well-written and informative book about life and relationships. I was reminded of many other books about the same subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not just an introduction to the topic, but an extremely valuable one.  It covers a great many topics, including a discussion of what we mean by "humanism" as a political philosophy, as well as a discussion (on the "neo-liberal" view, not the "liberal" one) of the relationship between "liberalism" and other concepts.  The authors go out of their way to explain, in lucid, clear prose, the many complexities and difficulties involved in these various philosophical concepts. They also provide the historical background for each of these ideas.  I would recommend this book for anyone who would like to become better acquainted with the major historical and philosophical influences on Western political thought, especially as they pertain to questions of "the right to life."
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book has good information, but there are some things I disagree with. For example, they say that women should be more "submissive" and "emotional", but then say that men are "the emotional leaders of the family" when a lot of men in the book don't even get that title. Also, I would have been better served by a better definition of "Submissive" (if it is something that exists) than "feminine".   I also think the author is very good at painting a female hero's struggle against a male oppressor.   Unfortunately, I was not really surprised by how badly this book ended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as an undergraduate, and was very impressed by the historical and literary analysis of the lives of the American revolutionaries.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A classic work on the history of the Cold War in the twenty-first century, written by a historian for a historian.  There's never been anything more entertaining or useful in the history arena. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a very entertaining and enlightening read about the history of one of the world's most misunderstood people: The Japanese. I've always been interested in the history and culture of the Japanese. Even the "comfort women" issue has been interesting for me. But I never really knew a lot about the women. After reading this book, I realized how many facts were conveniently forgotten about them. It's no wonder Japanese are so stereotyped and stereotyped so often! I especially liked the parts about how the military and government were "forced" into making the girls "comfort" the soldiers. I also liked the discussion of the sexual practices and attitudes of the women in the military as they were in the army. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was so good that it caused me to stop reading anything by Michael Crichton until I finished this one.  Crichtenstein has done it again.  I'm so glad that I bought this when it was first released.  It's a very enjoyable read and is full of interesting facts about life in the American West. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had to make a conscious decision to read this book for my high school English class because I was very frustrated with my writing and needed to find a way to improve.  I read this with a student who was struggling with her college application.  She was very interested in working for the United States Government and had written a number of commendable letters about her service.  In one letter, she had mentioned a trip she took with a military unit when she was a high school student in Hawaii.  They spent a weekend camping in the forest and were exposed to the natural world.  As a teenager, I had never been to a campground like that.  Although the writing was very good, I found the story boring.  It did not have any excitement or new ideas and I would have preferred to read a different story.  My student did not like this book but she also had very high expectations for what she wanted to accomplish in her life.  Despite her disappointment, I will certainly keep this book as a reference for me and my other students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you've ever felt depressed, you know that feeling isn't always fun.  It can feel awful at times and there's no easy cure.  This is definitely the book for you if you ever feel like that.  In addition to having a great book, the authors do a great job of explaining and illustrating what they've experienced.  I am thankful for them and I definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read two of the novels by John Grisham and loved them. This third novel by Grishan is a complete let down. The plot is bad, the characters are a joke, the book is over-written and poorly edited. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is extremely useful as a first introduction to the world of computers and computer systems.  The information is interesting, but the author is very loose about his references.  When a reference turns out to be erroneous, the writer makes a "reference correction" in the footnotes to the correct document.  I found it irritating and made me question the usefulness of the rest of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book a lot. I am writing a book on American English dialects. This book is an excellent resource for my research.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book very interesting because of its portrayal of black intellectuals in early 20th-century America. This book gives readers a good idea of how a man of color became a prominent intellectual, and shows that some black intellectuals are actually quite liberal and even progressive.   This book does not shy away from the racism of the time in order to make its points, and it shows, with the use of many examples, how racism worked to keep black intellectuals from becoming successful in the academic field.  The book also describes the efforts of black intellectual groups in the 19th- and early 20-th centuries to counteract racism through intellectual work and activism.  This type of activism is difficult today because of racism, and I found it interesting that some of the most important black intellectuals of the 19 and 20-century periods were actually black women.  I also found that the history of black women intellectuals was often misrepresented in academic history books and histories, which are often focused on white male scientists and male physicians as well as their contributions to science and medicine. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to say that I've been a bit disappointed by this one. The story, with its many twists and turns, is very well written, and the main character is likable. But I haven't had a chance to read all of the books in this series yet, so I'll leave that to those who have already done so.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found myself deeply moved by the book "Baptism by Fire."  It is one of the very few books on human spirituality that will make you feel like you have a direct connection to your God.  This is the third book I've read by Dr. Joseph Campbell.  He is one the most influential authors in the history of religions.  When he was young he had a serious spiritual crisis and became a Christian.  I'm a firm believer that Campbell has the most profound insights into spirituality that anyone alive.  His books have become a staple in all of my Christian reading.   Campbell is always brilliant and his latest work, "Biology and Culture" is another masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was blown away by this book.   A friend recently had a stroke and was unable to walk, but she's a superwoman and managed to get through every class and all of her practice.  This book is her favorite because it teaches you how to do yoga in a safe and enjoyable way and keeps you from injury. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read The Handmaid's Tale at age twenty-two, when I was so excited to hear that Margaret Atwood had written a feminist novel. Atwood's stories were so powerful, and so true to life, that it felt like I was reading a novel.  She is an incredible writer; I've read her books a dozen times, and they are never dull.  Now that I've finished, I can't wait for her next book, A Visit from the Goon Squad, about the sexist prison guards in the 1970s.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's been a great ride reading through The World Until Yesterday, and I've enjoyed every bit of it.  From its original concept to its brilliant execution, it's a fantastic read.  This is a book about what happens when the world is changed, and I think it's an awesomely thought-provoking look at that.  I know that I will be recommending it to everyone I know 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of Terry Pratchett and his works, so the fact that he got a hold of a copy of The Last Continent and gave it to me as a kind of gift made me even more excited for the upcoming release of the Discworld novels.  It seems like Terry would be really into this genre and he's certainly taken a liking to it. I think this book is a great introduction to the genre, showing how it all began in the days when it was the Wild West. I've only read one of the previous Discworld books, but I'd definitely pick this up if I were looking for a primer on the genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the most important book I have read on the subject of sex and relationships ever. It explains to both men and women what's wrong with today's dating scene, and why it is so damaging to both partners. It includes stories from actual couples to illustrate the problems, and the good ideas. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've ever read on the history of Western religion and its relationship to the modern world.  It is so concise and to the point that it will make its way into your mind long after you read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read a great deal of fiction about science and technology. Most of it is well done, but I find the ones written about computing to be particularly disappointing. Most stories end with the hero having to overcome something he cannot do, or having to return to his previous position to solve a problem that cannot be solved by any available technique. The only one I found that even attempted to deal with computing in a realistic manner was John Brunner's A Crack in Time (1993). Brunner writes about a robot who finds an old IBM that can do the job the human was unable to do: "You can only use so many bits of memory. The machines of the future will have so many memories that no human being could ever keep track of all the data they need. For that reason, the robots will have to take away some of your memories and put the rest in different parts of their brains." Well, sure, the robot does end up being forced to do things he cannot perform, but we are never told what. Instead we learn that the robot gets frustrated at being limited by the hardware, and decides to use an ingenious method to use more memory than he was given: "The robot found a new method of accessing his memory. He replaced the tape that he had been using with a smaller disk that could fit inside the machine. Each time he took an item out of the tape he could use the disk to save it. Then he used the disk's index to find the item he wanted again. He could then keep a lot of data in memory, but only about a tenth of it could ever be used." "If a robot is unable to save what he needs, how can he ever learn anything?" Well, I guess this is the problem with stories about computing. We do not see our machines learning, or improving over time. The human element seems to be absent or marginal, and the machine's "learning" seems to take place only at the level of hardware. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favourite book ever. I can't believe I haven't read it sooner. This book is both practical and insightful. I wish I knew this in elementary school. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found "The Little Black Book of Big Girls" to be a good reference book for understanding and enjoying Big Girls.   It is not a new book but has a wealth of references and stories for young girls to enjoy.  It contains both positive and negative depictions of Big Women but always has the positive.  The chapters are organized in a way that makes the most of the time when we can listen to the stories and be in the company of Bigs. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received my copy of the book "Crazy Wisdom" today.  I'm not sure if I can say what a great experience it has been, as I've only just started to practice yoga and have yet to even try the classes offered.  But this book is something different.   One of the things I'm most impressed by is the author's sense of humor.  She reminds me of those old comedy routines in which people are so desperate for a joke that they actually say "That's a funny joke, it's not really funny."  I can certainly see that in my own life too, and have often said to myself "That is a great joke, but it's really not funny at all." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I have read about Buddhism  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I've been working with a large group of people who want to find their own unique way of teaching English (and I've also been one of those people). It's not a pretty picture and everyone has their own style of teaching. This book covers a lot of topics (even the common misuses of 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought the book "Horses on the Run: How to Spot the Best Breeds and Train Your Own" to read with my husband. We have a 3.5 year old who has had some training problems and she was reluctant to take a lesson from a horse who seemed to know everything about a particular activity. When I read "Horsing Around: How Horses Can Run Through the Grunting Grasses" it changed her mind and she wanted to learn everything she could about her horse. It wasn't just the information about the horses but the information as it applies to all of us, horses and humans, and how we can use them to be more active and healthy! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have loved all of my Proustian biographies by Susan Sontag ( The Power of the Dog, The Little Hours, etc.), but this is the first time I have read a biography by Susan's brother, John, who lives in France. John is a historian of science (he's been working on the history of chemistry for almost 30 years), and he gives the Prousteian version of the life of Prou St. Petersburg and the city, rather than a popularized version. He also discusses the political situation at the time, with Prou st. Petersburg in a state of near-anarchy, and how the city was a focal point for the French Revolution, as well as the Russian revolution. The whole book is worth reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In reading   the book, I felt a profound empathy for people with Down Syndrome.  Their families were never allowed to make decisions about their children's education, and their families had been told that the disability made them less productive members of society.  One of the biggest criticisms of the book was the fact that people with Downs Syndrome are often labeled as lazy.  That is, they are not able to make the same level of intellectual and behavioral development as a non-disabled individual.  I thought that this would be a valuable book to give to a Down Syndrome family who is having trouble making the decision on whether or not their child should have Down Syndrome because of their own personal struggles.  It is one thing to be told you have to choose between the disability and your child's education or another thing altogether to see your child being raised in a community that has different standards for education than you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I highly recommend   "The Great Recession: The True Story of How a Great Country Lost Its Way" by Brad DeLong. I first read this book back in 2003, at the height of the last downturn and the subsequent bust in real estate. This is a very good book -- with the added bonus that it's written by a guy who actually went through the bust. DeLong's personal experience and knowledge make the book a compelling read -- though he's still an old-style mainstream economist, and the book is far from dry. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had never read a "historical romance" before this, but when I saw that it was about the First World War and the romance between a couple of sisters during the war, I had to read it. I found the writing to be clear and the characters to be well-developed. I enjoyed it very much. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book after being impressed by the cover art of the author's previous book, The Book of My Lives: The Extraordinary Story of a Jewish Woman's Love and Embrace of Islam. While the former is a compelling account of a woman's early years in Islamic cultures, the latter is a more interesting and enlightening narrative of life in the West, particularly the post-World War II United States. It's also an interesting and informative look at the "post-colonial era" - a time of rapid global change and shifting power dynamics. The author is able to provide a useful perspective to many people living in a different cultural context. While some may read this as a criticism of her personal views, I'm more interested in her thoughts and experiences than those of the culture she's part of. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a college professor, I love reading the works of good writers. It's so interesting how some of the ideas in their books become so relevant in our own time.  In this case, the idea that religion can be used to provide good morals is particularly relevant.  My kids and I have spent several years researching, debating, and thinking about the topic of religion and morality, and I think this book really captures it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read about being a trans woman.   The book has great advice for trans people, especially trans women.  The most important part of the book is the section about how to make friends with trans women, which is a major issue for trans women in my experience.  I was so pleased that the author included this important part, since it is one of the most difficult things I have learned about transness.  And the best part is that the book doesn't just focus on trans women's issues; the book discusses trans people in general, and how they can also have issues that are similar to trans women.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book that is a little bit dark, very realistic and with a good twist at the end is very well written and interesting.   In some respects, it reminds me of the book series of the same name by J.K. Rowling. The protagonists are very interesting and their stories are well told.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a great book. I liked how it mixed together the different voices of women, from the women of the past to the present to the future. The stories and the ideas were fresh and original. The author's descriptions of the different women were also very accurate and gave the women their own personalities. The authors were nice enough to give quotes from the various women, which helped me better understand their stories. I also liked how the author described the different foods of the various cultures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters were believable, and the prose was clean and well-written. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the motivations and feelings of others.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very informative.   It's well written, interesting, and well written.  As a teacher, I feel that there is nothing that I can add to this book that hasn't already been said. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Gates of Heaven" is one of the best short nonfiction books I have ever read. Gates's prose is clear and engaging. His account of his early Mormon years, his conversion and his experiences as a church leader, is fascinating.  He provides extensive documentation for his accounts, which is rare in nonfiction.  Gates's writing style, while simple and straightforward, is extremely powerful in showing how the Church is both a false church and a false way of thinking.  His book is both entertaining and enlightening, and if you read it in one sitting, you will be left with a positive impression and an improved view of your own religious beliefs. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. I agree that the author had more luck with her female characters than with her male characters, especially the female ones. I enjoyed reading about the trials and tribulations of women (especially black women). The writing style was easy to follow and I was entertained all through. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read and enjoyed a lot of books about the Mormon church, but I had to give this one a 4-star rating.   It was a good introduction to the church, which is so often talked about but seldom fully understood.  Even better, the book was written in a non-derogatory, neutral way, without any accusation, anger or harsh judgement. Â The book is so well written that it seems like this is what Joseph Smith would have wanted.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always admired the book "A Practical Guide to Writing a Good Life", by William James. James, though his ideas seem too far out there to work, at least he can back it up with data. I've been trying to decide how to start my next book, and this one seemed to me to be the closest to what I want to write.  James describes how people often go out of their way to sabotage other people, making themselves feel better by saying mean things, being selfish, and avoiding responsibility.  While I'm not saying that everyone is like this, I am suggesting that if you feel like someone is being an asshole to you, then it might be time to start looking at yourself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best historical works I have ever read. I particularly like the discussion of "American Exceptionalism" and its relationship to other, historical examples like American Exceptionalists in Germany, France, and Japan.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good and important book. It is not a comprehensive, but it is well written. I've just read the first two chapters and found it all very well written and informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in one day and can't wait to find out what happens next.  I'm always looking for new books on religion and psychology.  This one seems to fit that bill and I'm looking forward to following its progress.  It's fascinating.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book.  It was about how I went from having a good life in the church, to leaving the church.  The things that I left behind were things that really bothered me about my faith.   It seemed that I didn't need the church anymore, and I did want to get out of the church culture.  I found that it was not too difficult to do.  If there is one thing that I hope I've learned from this book, it is that you can leave the church without leaving Christianity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't remember where I was, but I'm pretty sure I was sitting on the porch of my friend's house in West Virginia when I started reading The Age of Anxiety (and it was one of my favorite books at the time). It was about the end of World War II, and a professor was trying to teach his students about the "crisis of the moment." The lesson he was trying too hard to teach was the "age of anxiety," the tendency of the average person to be afraid of everything and anything, and the fact that this fear can sometimes paralyze them and prevent them from doing things that might make them feel better. When you've lost so much of your normal, healthy life in the wake of some crisis -- like losing a loved one, being fired, etc. -- it's a little hard to put your life back together, let alone change things for the better. You may be able to change one or two negative habits or negative reactions, but most of the time you just find yourself having to adjust or adjust yourself back in a very painful way. I loved this book because I could relate to the professor's fears and also to the fact of being unable to do anything about them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book about the Vietnam War.  I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In an effort to help the younger generation to be successful, I took a chance and bought The Game, written by Michael Jordan. While I didn't enjoy Jordan's previous book, I was glad that this one had some value in it. In addition, I learned that MJ is an admitted former addict, and a former cocaine user. I thought this was a great read!
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a book I have been waiting a long time to get my hands on. The subject matter is well researched, fascinating, and informative. It covers the origins of the LDS Church, the role of women in the church, and a lot more. The book is very well written and should become a required reading for every church member.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved reading this book. I have a couple of older children who are about my age and one of them is a history buff. One of the books I read was a little on the historical aspects of the Vietnam War, but this one was a great mix of both of those. The author also did a great job of describing the cultural and political issues and how those factors affected the war. Overall, it was a good read for everyone interested in Vietnam.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a huge fan of the James Bond series for many years. I was a die-hard fan of Dr. No at the time and always thought that the movie was terrible (but I've since read everything by Ian Fleming). Now I have the original novel on the market in paperback. I have always admired Bond as a spy and assassin. I read The Spy Who Loved Me and The Man With The Golden Gun as soon as they came out. The novel has a fantastic storyline and a wonderful portrayal of Dr No. It is also a very interesting look at the world of espionage. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of the book tells the story of one of the most extraordinary man-made creatures to ever inhabit our planet, the whale. The second half of it follows the story as the whale is hunted for meat. I'm not really a fan of eating animal meat myself, but I liked the whole thing. It was compelling, suspenseful, and really, really interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always wanted to read a good YA novel that was more than just a young teen girl becoming an adult - that kind of book is so rare these days - but as a teen myself, I really liked "The Boy With All the Gifts" by Laura Anne Gilman.  I'm glad I finally got around to reading it!  I liked the story and how it was told, and I liked how Gilman showed that, even in young teens, there is still much to learn and a lot of growth still to come.  If she writes another young adult novel, I will definitely read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great, realistic history of the Soviet Union's post-World War II years.  In some ways it is as good as any book I have read on the Soviet collapse, if not better.  This book shows, at least to my eyes, the real horrors that were visited on the people of the country by the Soviet system.  It is also quite a bit better written than some of the others I have enjoyed, such as " The Cold War: An American Tragedy " or "The Great Terror."  I have found most books on the subject to be either too pro- or too anti-Soviet, so this is an excellent mix, to be sure.  The book also includes some of my favorite quotes from the "Great Brezhnev Interviews" with the Western press in 1985, such As I was saying, the Western reporters came in with the same preconceived notion, namely that the Soviet regime had turned evil, that it was an implacable and ruthless regime, but when the journalists spent some time with the people and visited the countryside and small towns, they were shocked to see the opposite. They were amazed to see that ordinary people had faith in the system, believed it could change and, in a sense, had grown used to the evils that plagued it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent and unique analysis of a very difficult area of psychology, social perception, or the study of social behaviour. In it, he discusses a number of interesting observations which he finds interesting but at the same time are not actually surprising. I found myself wondering if the observations actually fit into the existing social perception literature.   However, I found them to be interesting and useful for understanding human nature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book takes a lot of the guesswork out of the question of how we can live as if our souls are immortal. It points out that the human mind is not as flexible as we are and that the mind is susceptible to decay. The mind is the instrument we have used for a very long time to control our environment. It is not designed for a world of limitless energy and unlimited pleasure. Therefore, the mind must be programmed to adapt to change. The old system of physical reality was designed so that the body could operate efficiently under a variety of conditions, which was achieved by using some basic physical laws. The laws also gave the body the ability to make use of the vast amounts of energy created by the Sun and other stars. The brain operates at a very different level and so can not rely on the same physical laws that give the body a basis in which it operates. So what is needed is a more complete system of laws to be able to operate in such a way. As the human brain is not able to adapt this is the only way we will be able not to suffer the effects of age. In order to learn more about the mind and how it can be modified by changing the physical environment, the author takes us to the world of shamanism. She talks about how many of the ancient cultures around the world have used shamans to control the energy fields in order to make a living from the power. In this book, the shaman is the one who controls the mind through the mind controlling the body. There is no doubt that this will be one of the most talked about books of the year. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in human consciousness and how we are controlled by our physical brains.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the way this book takes the history of the church in America and shows its place in the modern day world. It is not always a "good thing" to be Mormon, but to have the church take the place that it had in the old days is an awesome development!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  The characters are well-developed and the book has a great plot.  It's a bit slow at first, but it gets better and better as the book progresses.  I'll definitely be picking it up again! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can safely say that The Book of Laughter and Forgetting will change the way you think about your own mind. I have tried many ways to "get out of my head" and find humor in my day to day struggles.  The book taught me a new method of humor that I will use from now on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It is so well researched, and covers so many different topics that it feels like it was written for my own classroom. The book starts with a discussion of the importance of an early childhood education to a child's development and continues through an overview of developmental skills in children. This is followed by a discussion on how parents can improve their child's social and emotional skills. This was extremely informative and I was very surprised at how often the authors point out how early childhood is important. We can all learn a lot from this book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed    This is another great book by a brilliant woman.  She is an important figure in the history of medicine and her writing is also excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book I have read this year.   A wonderful tale that tells the story of an individual who came from a very dark place, but ultimately emerged as one of the most wonderful people I've ever known. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was very informative for me as I am currently writing my final exam.  The information provided about the different types of people and how to write about them is invaluable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really loved this book. It's been a while since I've read a good novel, but this one managed to make me want to read more.   It was refreshing to read a fantasy that is actually about real people rather than an imaginary world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's such a great book and so well-written that it could have been written ten or twenty years ago.  The book's main theme is that, despite the fact that the US economy is not particularly good, we have done a great job of turning our back on the world.  If there's a theme in this book, it's that the world is not so bad after all. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title is the least of my problems with this book. I don't think I could have finished it at all without becoming angry at the author, although the anger seemed to be directed at the religious and/or cultural beliefs of others. I found myself feeling angry in reaction to several events in the book, some that might have been predictable to a more mature adult.  For example: -  We are presented with a woman whose husband is a professor of science and math.  She is a Christian, and although she admits that she has problems with certain parts of the Bible (particularly some of the passages that discuss female subjugation), she does not see herself as a victim of divine retribution. She feels that, rather, she is merely following God's will.  But then she makes a shocking admission about the role of women in ancient Jewish society, which she did not know at the time:  I felt a lump in my throat when I read this, a lump that refused to go away. It seemed to say that, in ancient Israel, women had no rights whatsoever.  This is not, I felt, a statement of historical fact.  It was a statement based on the Bible, based on ancient culture, based, in the author's mind, on the divine will.   I think that the author was attempting to make a point about the divine decree that men have power over women.  And that this decree has nothing to do with the sexual abuse of women, even if that abuse happened centuries ago.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not only a scholarly review of an important and important work, but a highly readable one, too. The book is a historical account of the emergence of the modern American church, with many interesting bits from Mormon history, including the Nauvoo expositor that sparked the Church's downfall. The author uses many primary sources, as well as interviews with people that played important roles in shaping the Mormon experience. She provides a wealth of information about the period, including how the Mormons came to terms with their belief that some races were better off than others and how the church's position on race evolved. The chapter on Mormonism's religious evolution is particularly interesting. It explores the influence that the religion had on other religions, from Christianity to Mormonism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  It was written with the help of a wonderful psychologist, who took the time to explain and support her story.  I really liked that she did not write in a monotone, but did so with a very gentle, clear voice.  She did not say things like, "This is just the way men think," or "Women are just like this" or "I am a victim of the patriarchy."  She talked about the good things men and women can have, and even talked about a few men she knows who really "get" it.  Her story was a reminder that being a woman doesn't mean you get things for nothing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a huge influence on me, not only as a writer, but as a human being. It has provided me with a framework for my life and relationships that has been incredibly helpful, but it has also been incredibly challenging. It reminds me that it is important to be honest about where we have been, and to be willing to let go of things that have no longer served us.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My students are always learning, and the authors of this book have made an outstanding contribution to this important endeavor. I particularly enjoy the section on the history of the American public library and the role it played in the founding of our nation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It is very well written. It does have flaws that are minor, but you know how that goes. The main flaw is that the author tries too hard to connect the main characters to some sort of historical character. This works in some scenes, but in others, it just isn't working. I really like the plot and character development, but it just seems to me that he has over-wrought things by trying to show historical characters from a specific historical period. The book could have been shorter and I would have enjoyed it more. I do recommend this book, but only to the people who like historical fiction. It's worth the price just because it's interesting historical fiction and it doesn't try too hard, but just has a good plot.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about how to be a good Christian: not just for me, but for everyone in my life. I've seen the Christian church transform and improve many of its members' lives. This book shows how. I think it's very positive that Dr. Barrow has put his time and expertise in writing this book and has found many of the reasons that Christians and other people do well by the grace of God. It's great to see someone with such experience talk about it so openly. I'm sure other Christians will come to similar conclusions. It really is a joy to see what I've always believed, but had to pretend to believe to be accepted by most people: that Christians can change our lives. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I was so moved by the way that my grandmother felt after reading it. It made me think about the people in my family who've experienced Alzheimer's, and I think it was also good to read about the different kinds of treatments that have been found to work on people with Alzheimer's. I've actually been told by a family member that she'd just started to regain her memories of her mother and father after the first treatment, but after the second one it took her all of two days to regain the ability to talk. It's interesting to read how different the different treatments have been from one another, and how different people respond to them.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most amazing thing about this book is how it was written by a female - so we can have the same experience!   From the first paragraph we are taken to a beautiful world, so unlike our own.  Then we are introduced to these beautiful creatures and each is given their own paragraph to tell us about them.   They are so cute, it's hard not to love them. Â   The author clearly wrote for a girl who wanted to be a frog, but wasn't quite there.  That's what I liked about this novel.  It made me want to be another creature, even if it meant being something I didn't look like. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a great book for a lot of reasons:  The writing was clear, the explanations accurate and interesting, and the information is easy to put into practice (with the most useful and useful part being the section "How to Use Your Personal Insight" ).  The book does get a little heavy-handed with descriptions and metaphors at times, but it's not something I would call a "waste of time".  The concepts are well thought out and very applicable.  There were also interesting references to other authors as well as to other cultures, so if you need inspiration, this book is for you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character, Joe, lives in a trailer park and is a high school dropout. He's a big fan of his favorite television shows, and he's a hard worker. He meets a new girl, Julie, at school. She's also a high-school dropout, and is also a big sports fan. He wants to meet more people like them, and Julie seems to fit the bill. But their relationship is complicated by their respective parents' expectations. Julie's parents are strict, and want their daughter to take up a career. Joe's parents believe in a more relaxed attitude towards success and want him to become a police officer. Their opposing views clash with each other and the whole book is about them squabbling about it. As a reader, I found the book enjoyable. I could see the conflict that was going on between Joe and Julie. Their relationship was intriguing and made me think about other people I know who had different relationships with their parents. This book was well-written and I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I've purchased from the O. Henry publishing company since I am moving to a new city.   Henry has managed to capture the essence of the American city while writing in an accessible and entertaining manner.  The style is still quite idiosyncratic.  This isn't a great book about urban life, but it's a good one that's easy to enjoy and get to know.
Write a positive review about a good book:   If I could rate a book, I would give this one a four-star rating.  It's well written and has a lot of good information.  Unfortunately, I had some trouble keeping up with the material, but eventually I came around.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very well written. The writing style is very different from the popular writing style. It's very clear, direct and easy to follow. In fact, it's hard to believe that this was written in the 20th century. It sounds like it could be written by the guy who wrote the great novels, like Gone With the Wind and The Grapes of Wrath. I also liked how it took into consideration the different social classes in the US. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is filled with good observations about the nature of human experience: 1. People who have bad habits, like smoking, eating, or drinking too much, are very hard to change. 2. People are very easy to fool. 3. People generally fail in the same way over and over again. 4. People don't realize that their experiences are very important, and don't pay any attention to the negative ones. 5. People's lives are largely defined by the way they behave. 6. The more interesting people are, the more they are ignored. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a teenager (around 13) as a good way to practice reading with an adult. I never finished it, but I recommend it to any teen or adult who likes to read.   It is a good read, easy to understand, and easy to share. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very excited about this book, although I was only mildly interested in the subject matter (I'm an economist by training).  I didn't like the writing style very much.  The sentences were not always grammatically correct.  For example, the second chapter begins, "But in the case of a market failure, there are always multiple levels of market failure in play at the same time."  The word "only" is ambiguous and could be a modifier or a noun.  I think that he should have chosen another word.  Still, his point was made and I did learn some things about economic history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I'm a first time graduate student at UC Davis. I haven't yet finished reading all the textbooks on the subject, but this book is definitely an improvement on what I've been reading. I love the focus on critical thinking and analysis in this text. I think a lot of the information in the textbook is outdated, but I find the focus of the writing to be accurate. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It has everything a teacher should have in her/his arsenal - interesting case studies; informative explanations; effective lesson plans; and a healthy dose of humor.  It doesn't overdo it on the science or give it a religious tone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book as much as I did the last one I read about the Bible. I was not so happy about it as some people were but still pretty much enjoyed reading it.  The fact that the author gives equal emphasis to the historical, historical-philosophical, and biblical portions of his book does not detract from his enjoyment of the latter.  Although there are times when I found it annoying that he tried to show that the Hebrew Bible was more or less "true" than the Greek or Roman versions, I still enjoyed the book enough to recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought this was a very good book.  The writing style is clear and to-the-point. I really like that.  There is a lot of background about the evolution of science in general.  You get the basic idea.  I'm glad I picked this book up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book gives us an exciting look at the origins of modern science.   As I read this book, I kept thinking that the author didn't give a lot of time to the actual development of science - just to the stories behind the scenes.  He mentions the famous saying "What separates us from the animals is not our brain, but our capacity to learn" - but the book doesn't explain why or how our brain could have evolved in such a way.  Similarly, he mentions that we're not meant to use tools or make complex tools, but doesn't offer any evidence for why or why we would develop the brain to make tools in the first place.  I did enjoy reading about the amazing development of medicine during the past 150 years, but he made no mention of how the development of surgery or the use of antibiotics could have been possible.  A less technical book might have been a better choice, but I enjoyed this one anyway.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have had my share of books on mental health.  I really liked this one.  It was entertaining and educational.  The author also points out that there are many mental illnesses, and some are more prevalent than others.  A good starting point for those interested in mental illness.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I finished The Great God Pan, and I have to say that I'm impressed. I was skeptical at first, because the book had a poor track record in the past. But it didn't disappoint:  Pan was an honest, humble, hardworking man. He did his own work and tried to help others as well. He was kind to others in return. His story and life were fascinating. He didn't deserve all the bad things he had to deal with. But there were many good things in Pan's life as well, too. He is an inspiration to me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  The authors did a great job of writing a book about a topic that is often overlooked by many authors: "The Art of Loving" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was reading The History of the Great Powers in the Nineteenth Century: A Compilation of the Best of American and English Foreign Writing.  I wanted to like this book.  It had many good features.  The introduction was clear and informative.  I liked that the authors pointed out that other works of this sort were not very good.  This book was well written, well organized, and it made a good point about imperialism.  But the last section was very, very strange.  They described the "rise of a new and vigorous type of American imperialism."  They spoke of a sort of "New Great Power."  It did not mention any particular nation by name.  There was an implication that it was America that led this change.  Here's what they wrote: "The Great Powers were also to play a larger role. In the nineteenth century, the first great powers had a common interest in expanding their empires. But whereas the United States was a world power in its own right, the empires of Britain and France were not. The growing powers of Japan, Germany, and Russia were bound together by shared ambitions, by a common ideology, and by a commitment to a common set of rules. By the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, this was to become the norm. "The new Great Powers--and their empires--came to stand for a new vision of the world. They were to see the world in terms of an international system of economic cooperation and of military alliance. They saw each great power as a member of a political and economic club. They expected others to recognize and support them by adhering to this set of values. They could never be expected to do it for themselves. This was the basic argument of nineteenth-century American imperialism. "While most of the old Great Powers pursued their own interests, and the new ones were content to be the servants of others, the new powers looked forward to a world in which they would have to compete with all the others for resources and power. "In the years following the war, the United states took an increasingly active role in international affairs. It began by adopting the Monroe Doctrine to assure a permanent sphere of influence for the United Kingdom. Then it expanded its sphere of military and economic influence, by helping to create a network of alliances that stretched from Japan to France. American diplomacy helped shape a series of new agreements: the Bretton Woods institutions that governed the international monetary system
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second in a four-part series by Michael Grant about what he calls "the rise and fall of Western Civilization" is excellent in every way. The first book is "The Culture of Narcissism." The first part covers the origins of Western civilization, the second part, "The Fall," focuses on its decline and the ways in which the West is beginning to return. "The Rise" covers the rise of Western Europe and the United States. "Fall" covers what the West will be and, for that matter, what will be next. This book is excellent on all fronts and deserves to be required reading for any serious student of the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a great book! I enjoyed the way it focused on the social, cultural, and historical aspects of an aspect of the human experience I had no knowledge of at the time - the historical significance of music.  I'm sure that many of you, like me, grew up in a musical family, but I was never that interested in the music in my house, and even though I can play a bit, I never learned how to play.  What an interesting experience reading this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished Peter Rollins' The Bible in Seven Days: A Study Guide for the Bible.  The Bible is an incredibly important text and it seems like Rollins tries to cover it all.  Rollins covers the history of the book, the history and purpose of the various editions, the historical and cultural context of the text, as well as other important parts of the Bible such as the Old Testament.  He goes over various passages and discusses them in a way that allows us to apply their meaning to our own lives and their relevance to our religious and cultural traditions. Â  This is definitely a book to keep an eye on.  I'm looking forward to reading all his other resources and learning about other interesting aspects of the historical Bible.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives a good introduction to evolutionary biology, genetics, and the human genome.  The author lays out the main features of each of these areas in the most practical way possible, which is particularly helpful when dealing with complex topics.  He explains the process by which DNA is passed down through generations by talking about "transgenealogical trees," which is really a metaphor for the genetic relationships between closely related organisms, but the analogy works.  At the end of the book he gives a list of common misconceptions about evolution that I think are worth debunking.  I do not have any disagreements with the author about many things, but for some of them I don't think he gets the science quite right. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first read about religion that I have enjoyed.  It makes me think more about my faith and what I believe.  As a Jewish Christian, I find my faith in Jesus Christ to be absolutely fascinating. The book also provides a great deal of context about the history and culture of Jews throughout the world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Best Way to Learn a New Language: An Instant Learner's Guide to Learning Every Language" by Deborah J. Tucker and Susan F. Tucker is an instant classic! Deborah Tucker and her husband, Susan, have done it again. This is a wonderful book, in which the author does a great job teaching readers the essential language skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. In less than one hour, they explain the differences between each of these skills in such a way as to make it clear why each one is important. Although the book covers quite a few languages, including English, German, Spanish, Russian, and Japanese, the authors make a point of specifically teaching Spanish.   I think it's a fantastic idea.  I have always struggled to learn English, but when I began using these lessons, my vocabulary really improved. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been looking for something like this for a long time. It is not too long, and it is good enough to be an e-book too. It has a lot of humor and also references interesting things like the film version of 'Battleship'. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always been envious of the many people who are able to get through this book and the many more who will pick it up.  It's a great read that has helped me to get over my doubts and to see through some of my own biases.  I'm now a better person, thanks.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you have the means and patience to read this book, this is a must read. In this wonderful collection of essays, the authors take on issues of race, gender, and class in an extremely honest and insightful way. This book is so well written that even though I'm not an academic of any kind, I feel like I understand how race is used to manipulate and exploit poor white people.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this short book, the author focuses on the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the human condition.  The book starts out with a description of a young child (and mother) who has been paralyzed from the neck down for over a decade.  She has not grown a single muscle and has been confined to a wheelchair.  To the astonishment of her parents, she begins to communicate by writing and is able to communicate to them by voice.  This child and her family's response to the Industrial revolution is an excellent parallel to our response to environmental problems today.  I found that the author's account of this girl's transformation was most moving. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I've read that makes a clear case that the New Testament does indeed contain a historical Jesus.  I had read a few books on the historical Jesus and generally found them wanting.  This book is by far the best I've encountered.  It is thoroughly documented, clearly written, and the conclusions it draws are well supported.  Unlike most books that simply quote the Gospels to support a certain position, the author of this book clearly demonstrates that many of the G. T. aspects (like the G-d aspect, miracles, etc.) do indeed exist.  Without even mentioning the New Testaments, the book contains citations from numerous biblical scholars who agree with this thesis.  My biggest complaint is the lack of an index.  Hopefully that will be rectified with a second printing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I just finished reading this book on the subject of the Catholic Church. It's not easy reading -- although the writing style is good -- but we were both happy to read it. It was informative and informative at the same time.  We had never really given much thought to what Catholic teaching meant. We had both been raised by "born again" Christians and were skeptical about their interpretation of the Bible. We were also somewhat cynical about the Catholic view of morality.  Although the book talks about a "New Evangelization" the authors say that "we are far too conservative a church.  The Catholic church is too conservative.  It's just not right."  If it were not for the book, I wouldn't be so bothered by the constant harping on the "New"ness of the church. The author, Michael Horton, is also the author of a series on "The New Evangelization," the third one is entitled "The Church of the Future" and is the most positive in my opinion. The Church of Today 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much. It's very well written and does a great job of getting people to think.   It doesn't tell you everything, but it doesn't need to.  There are a lot of interesting thoughts that could come from a little more in-depth investigation.  But I'm happy with the results, and will use the information for my upcoming college course on writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think I was able to enjoy the book most because it was written by an African-American author.  The book provides a unique perspective on race relations in the United States.   This perspective can only come from being the son of a white woman and a black man.  I believe that, despite my own racial biases, it is important for white people to learn more about African-Americans.  However, the author, Mr. Davis, was clearly not comfortable in his own skin.  He described his "white woman" wife as being a "chocolatey, smooth girl."  "As a white man," Mr.Davis said, "I know it's hard to think of myself as a person of color."  Mr.Eliot, by contrast, was an interesting man, who seems to have lived through and survived the Civil War, and he also seemed to think he was a "white man" until he was married to an African woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best science book I have read. The best explanation of how the human body works I have ever read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Book of Mormon does not use fancy, elaborate prose, nor does it use sophisticated arguments. The authors are very good storytellers. The writing style is accessible and easy to follow. The stories are engaging and engaging. The themes of "the choice between darkness and light" and "the desire to help others" are engaging to the end.   I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. This is one of the few historical works that doesn't give a positive spin on the United States. It makes the case that the US has many problems, but I believe that it is still the best society in the world and that it can still be good, if people stop blaming others and work on fixing their own problems instead.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book on the history of American literature that I've ever read.   It has everything that one needs to know about the history and development of literature in America: the historical background; the critical discussions, including a review of the various novels that have made a mark on literature and American literature in the past; and the various authors who have influenced the American literature of the past.  The history is fascinating, but the focus is on the authors themselves and their contribution to the American literary tradition.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history, literature, and influence of the American novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received the electronic version of this book from the publisher.  The digital file is much more convenient, since you can access it on your computer anywhere.  It's more convenient than the hardcopy version, in that you can read the whole book at your leisure.  I found it quite helpful, although there are some chapters that are somewhat dry.  Some parts of the book may be somewhat boring or tedious to read, because the author tends to write in a very formal, academic, and detailed manner, making it difficult to absorb. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a few of this author's books on other subjects, but never on the history of American political thought. This one is brilliant.  In this short book, John Taylor Gatto argues that the political divide between those in the Northeast and South had its roots in economic and social inequality.  Gatto traces the roots of the division back to the American Revolution and argues that one of the main causes of the conflict was that the South was more likely to be enslaved than the North.  This led to a belief that the poor should never have been freed, because it would lead to the loss of slave labor.  Taylor Gantz goes on to argue that this "Southern bias" remained throughout the eighteenth century.  It was not until the Civil War that the economic divide was more evened out.  I think this argument is brilliant, and makes perfect sense.  The book is very well written, and I recommend it highly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in a library for a free sample, and when I started it, I immediately picked up some of the metaphors.  I have a tendency to do that when reading, and it worked for me.  The way the characters relate to one another was also intriguing.  A bit of self-consciousness about one's own appearance is a good way to get to know the character 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. I am a native English speaker and this book helped me to read the Japanese characters correctly. I also enjoyed the illustrations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved   the historical details about the rise of feminism in the early 20th century. It's so fascinating to see what these women were thinking and doing. I have an idea about a story I want to tell about this, which will use the stories of these women to explore some of the challenges of changing social norms. This book is worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In a recent review of The Book of Love   I said that the title could not have been more misleading:  The main character in the book, an aging Buddhist priest, has the experience of being loved by a 14-year-old female member of the opposite sex.  He experiences the "love of a mother for her child"  which, he realizes, is nothing but "the love of a man for a woman."   The book is full of such moments:  One afternoon I was reading The Book, on my way to work, when I came across the following passage.  It is at once the best and the worst thing I've ever read.  The Book was originally published in 1980, the year after my own father was murdered.  For a long time, as a teenager, I believed that all of my father's killers were gay, and, like me, they were repressed their attraction for men.  Eventually I came to believe that my father was actually gay, but kept it secret, which explains why he never pursued a relationship with a woman.   This "secret" was the source of much anguish in my life, but one of the few things I could remember enjoying about my father.  I was particularly saddened when I learned that my stepfather, who had been a male-dominated religion, had a wife and two daughters.  But I was also relieved when I read that my grandmother had had a relationship for a time with a man she met through church, but it ended when his father caught her and forced her to stop.  These examples are interesting, because, as I noted, they do not seem to have a direct bearing on The Book.  Some of my family members are homosexual, which makes it hard for me to believe they would experience "the feeling of the love of one's mother for one's child."  I am glad I read about it, but I'm glad that my family does not feel the same way.  However, this book is a brilliant example of how a writer can use "the secret" to create a deeper meaning.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little surprised that this was written by a woman. There are a lot of male authors who write about the emotional toll of losing a loved one. And I do think there are some of those, as well. But this book wasn't about that at all. It was about a different type of loss: the loss of a physical self. Not because I am opposed to that type of self loss -- I'm all about them. But I found the book extremely insightful and even entertaining in the way that it captured the lives of women during the period of time when I felt I was losing my mind and my body to cancer. I felt as though I'd be able to go on living with this knowledge forever, and that I could be as positive as I wanted to be, but it was just too painful. I also appreciated that the book talked about the physical and mental effects that cancer had on the women who lived through it and talked about it in an entertaining way, and I was glad to read about these things from their perspective. I thought the book was well written, and it definitely helped me understand how I was feeling and where I could go with my life.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, written by the great David Foster Wallace, is the best, most accessible, and most profound book on language I've ever read. It shows that language is everywhere, that language can be a powerful tool for survival and understanding, that the act of creating words and phrases and constructing sentences is one of the most basic acts we perform as human beings.  The book is structured as a series of interviews Wallace has conducted with a number of language experts, linguists, and linguistics professors. It's very well written, and Wallace is very engaging and funny throughout.  You'll feel like you're part of Wallace's circle of friends.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed a number of Tom Robbins books, but I have to say I had to change my rating for this one. I first heard about this book from a friend who found a copy of it on a shelf while looking for something else to read.  It seemed to have a good "bite" to it, and I was glad to have found it.  Unfortunately, the bite just isn't there.  I'm sure it will be appreciated by Robbins's many fans, but it is a book that I didn't enjoy reading.  Robbins' style is entertaining and interesting, but this book just does not live up to the hype.  This is the fifth in a series, so it's possible Robbins is just getting a bit bored with writing the same old stories.  That could be, but the book seems to lack any spark.  The same old material just isn 't exciting anymore.  Maybe Robbins doesn't have that same spark for the next few books, or maybe he's just getting tired of telling the same stories. I don't know.  In the end, I can't recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a great read. A great story, full of emotion, and even a bit of romance.  I've heard that people can get the same idea from this book, so it's definitely a good recommendation.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The authors use the terms "sexual attraction", "sexual function", "love", "lust", "desire", and "lust" and describe each in different ways.   "Desire" is always used when discussing sexual attraction.  "Love" is used when describing sexual function.  There is little differentiation in terms of the way these terms are used.  It is not until the very end of the book, after the book has been described from all sides, that "lust, love, lust" are finally discussed.  However, there is no discussion about any of the other terms.  Perhaps the authors should have included these other terms for the sake of discussion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had the most fun reading this book. The authors discuss the psychology of addiction in a way that is both helpful and entertaining. The humor is really good as well. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has had a friend or loved one who was addicted to drugs or alcohol. The book is written with a light touch. The best part of the book is the discussion of the effects of marijuana and other drugs on the brain.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book on the subject of women's libido (in the English language as well).  The author uses her own experiences as a woman with a "man-crush" to demonstrate the limitations of such a theory.  She doesn't try to tell us what we should do about this but she makes a very convincing case that a woman's sexuality is as complex as ours.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a treasure trove of information on a variety of topics. I found that the information on how to take care of animals was particularly useful, as well as how to handle certain types of emergencies. The book also includes tips for dealing with various kinds of stress, including mental, physical, and emotional stress.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be quite useful in my attempt to learn how to read the Bible. There were a couple of parts where I was having difficulty, but the book explained the problem, then provided some suggestions on how to overcome it.  I'm also glad that it's not only limited to the King James version of the Bible  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have never been one to read just for the pleasure of it. I know I'm supposed to read for its intellectual content. It has none, but I enjoyed it for its beauty, for the way it made me feel, and for its beautiful sentences. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this book, I was completely confused by the plot. I thought I had already read this sort of thing (perhaps with some inspiration from the popular children's books I used to read as a kid, or perhaps from "Hocus Pocus" and other fairy tales) and now I had to find the next installment. After some frustrating moments, I figured out what was happening. I'm not so sure how I got through it the second time around, but the story is definitely worth the read and I will definitely be recommending it to others!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The way that this book is structured is an asset to a reader in a variety of ways.   I was looking for a good history book on the rise and fall of the United States, and stumbled upon "American Power" when I saw it recommended by a fellow blogger.  This book was recommended for its analysis of the rise of political activism in the United states.  It did just that.  The authors are excellent, and the subjects treated here are interesting.  But as I looked over the book, I found that the authors spent a lot of time talking about American business  and American business in general.  I found myself wondering about the sources, and wondering if the authors used a lot more sources than I would have liked.  Perhaps this was unavoidable, since they were using the work of American business historians, and American historians are notoriously prone to making assertions about American "history" that have a long, long way to go before being accepted as fact. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found The World Without Us by a friend very interesting. I like the concept and the fact that he uses this as the main point of his book.  There are two sides to the story and the reader can choose which side they are on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've recently moved to the area of northern NJ, and this book has always been a great source of information on the area. The history of the area is so thorough and detailed that it's almost funny. The pictures, especially, are excellent.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've ever read on the subject of the ancient Greek culture.   While reading, I was also reminded of how much I love a good Greek mystery novel (I read a copy of Phaidon's The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation last year, which was absolutely brilliant, too) and how much of a joy it is to delve into a character's world and their lives and the way that story is written so perfectly.  This book also reminded me of the movie In the Name of the Father.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so pleased with this book! It is the definitive work on the history of American racial relations during the twentieth century. As a result, I feel like I am finally getting a true and accurate history of racial attitudes in America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good introduction to modern Greek literature. It is short, well written, and easy to follow.  A very good choice for a summer reading assignment.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was going through some tough times in my life. I had just found out I had colon cancer. I was losing hope that I would live through the disease, and in my last week I was diagnosed. After my diagnosis I was so devastated and heartbroken. I felt that I had lost the people who love me and supported me. I couldn't imagine not being able to have a family. After the diagnosis I decided that I couldn-t handle living with cancer anymore. I decided to go for chemotherapy. After chemotherapy I had one last hope. I went to visit my mother and brother. After talking with my brother about my life with cancer and my treatment, I was motivated to read this. I realized that I don't have cancer anymore and I can make a positive difference in people's lives. Thank you for making this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've read on mental health in the last few years.  If you have a loved one with depression, bipolar disorder, or other mental illness, you need to read this book.  It's the first book that made me realize how I am helping my loved ones. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book so much! I read it when I was 12, and it made such a huge impression on me that I continued to read it for a long time afterward. My dad bought a used copy from a used book shop for me when I started going to college. And I kept going back to it because it always had some good advice, especially on how to deal with bullies. It was such an interesting time in my life, and I couldn't put it down.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book about what it's like to be a Jewish person in a non-Jewish culture:  A friend of mine said, 'I can't imagine ever feeling like you have been in a bad movie'.    In the book she describes feeling that way on a trip to Israel with her parents. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book as much as all of the books I have read in the past five years.  I am glad that there is something for everyone, including those who feel a strong need for the physical form, those who don't want to read all the way to the end, and those who find that a long book is boring.  The writing is clear, the plot is interesting, the characters are well developed, and there is enough time spent with the "bad guys" to justify reading the rest of the series.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you want to get a quick, fun read on a subject that is difficult for a non-fiction writer to write about, or if you just want to enjoy some good literature, then I'd recommend this book.  The plot and characters are simple enough to make it fun and easy to understand.  There's even some nice wordplay here that is easy to pick up on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-read.   The best part about this book is that it really shows how to do interviews.  For someone like me, a journalist/columnist, this book should have come out a long time ago.  I remember reading interviews with John Lennon and Paul McCartney when they were first becoming famous, and while they were brilliant, I never got the sense that they really got how the business works.  Here, Lennon and McCartney demonstrate how to interview a celebrity like the Beatles, and they do it in a way that makes it fun.  The interviews themselves are also interesting, as well as some of the behind-the-scenes information.  You really don't get that sort of access when you are a journalist or an author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  It is not just another work about mental illness by someone who has the condition, but instead it is a personal account of his journey, and it is well written and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The two main characters in this book are a married couple whose children, as adults, become the best friends and closest allies of each other, despite their lack of a shared religious belief. Their friendship is a fascinating story in itself: the author explores the many religious and philosophical beliefs of their generation in their attempt to understand and appreciate each other. This book, more than any other, is an example of an author doing an excellent job of telling a deeply personal and powerful story with minimal information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. I am a professor who studies religious thought and practices, and I've read quite a few of the works by scholars of religion and Christianity. It is quite striking that no one has written an analysis of the Jesus movement as it evolved from the first century to the end of the second.   This book is the first to do so.  It makes a strong case for the uniqueness of Jesus as the first Jesus of Christianity.  In the book, Karr says, "The Jesus movement was unique in terms of the way it came to be, the reasons it went down in history, the social and political factors that made it so powerful and unique, and what it meant for Western culture and religion." I found it to be absolutely compelling. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, both in theory and in practice. It has a nice balance between philosophy and practicality and it also addresses some very pressing contemporary issues. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book several times and each time I found it richer and more fascinating than the last. The characters are so well-developed and the story so enthralling that I couldn't put it down.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great read, full of rich history and vivid details. The details of the American War for Independence are particularly interesting:  In the words of historian Eric Foner, "the American Revolution was not merely the culmination of a long and bitter struggle, but a 'civil war,' in which two groups in American society fought against one another for the control of their society."  The American Revolution is the story of the conflict between the British monarchy and the American colonies. The struggle is fought in three forms: the struggle to preserve the Union, the struggle for independence, and the struggle of the colonies to attain their sovereignty.  All of the colonists were fighting for their independence. The American War of Independence was not just a war, but also a civil war, in which the British aristocracy fought the American colonists. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about parenting that I found really insightful.  It is definitely one of those books that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to improve his/her parenting.  Although some parts were not as helpful as I would have hoped, the book has so much great information that I could just about list the good points and bad points.  The most important part is the "Moral Code of Parenting", which is such a useful guide.  Also, I really liked the part about the difference between being a bad parent and a good one.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you love books like I do and enjoy the time spent paging through them, you'll be delighted by this one. It's written by a woman with a very unique viewpoint, one that seems very relevant to the contemporary zeitgeist (even if her writing isn't always as crisp or as thought-provoking as many of the more recent books she covers). While I won't say the book itself is perfect, I can tell you that it's good.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very useful, especially for anyone who wanted to learn how to code in Python.  The authors used the official Python documentation (the API reference and the Python book) as the main source of information.  There are also several good resources (e.g. Codecademy, Python Web Scraping Tutorial, The Python Language Reference) that the authors used.  Overall, the book is written in a very engaging way.  They write about a variety of interesting topics that many programmers don't think about as often (elements of the language, testing, and the import system).  I also found a few tips and tricks of their own that I will incorporate into my own Python code, especially when coding with the Python debugger (i.e. if I find myself trying to import the same module repeatedly).  As a bonus, it also includes a number of coding assignments and exercises (all the code can be found on GitHub).
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's such a good story, and so well done. It is, however, not without its shortcomings. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My two favorite books have been "Cats and Dogs" and "Puss in Boots."  When I started reading these books, I was surprised to find that these books weren't "titles" at all.  I thought of "The Princess Bride" as the name of the book, but the word "Pussy" is nowhere in the book.  Apparently, in the original "Cattleya," there was more dialogue in that book about cats, not dogs.  That "Puppy Love" book came out around the same time, and I wasn't really interested, so I didn't think much of it.  Now that I've read all the books, and watched all the movies, I feel differently.  The books are still good, but now I think of "Punishment for a Crime" as a "Pee Wee Herman" book, and "Couples" as an "I Love Lucy" show.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was looking for a book on early Christianity, but I've been meaning to do this for quite a while, so I waited for it to come out. I'm glad that I finally did. It's an excellent book. It has all the information I need to understand the early church and the apostolic fathers in a way that's accessible and interesting. It doesn't gloss over the difficult issues, and it avoids the pitfalls of modern attempts to explain faith with modern tools. It does not treat Christianity as just a way of doing Christian living, or a source of comfort, but as a complete worldview, with all the strengths and weaknesses of all worldviews. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite books of all time are all about overcoming difficult challenges: By The Hand of God by Carl Rogers and The Courage to Be by Robert Kennedy. I also like The Black List by Matt Ridley. But neither is quite as good as this one. It's true that the writing is a bit rough around the edges and the topic is a little dry, but the writing and subject matter are both so powerful, and the themes so meaningful that I can't help but read on. I was actually looking forward to the "How-To" part of the book because the first few chapters were kind of boring. But then the subject matter kicked in: how one must deal with adversity in order to move forward in life. It was almost like reading my own life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It was written by a medical doctor and is a fairly non-medical, straightforward presentation of what is known about autism.  The author also has experience with the families who have been affected by autism and is very clear on what to expect.  It's a well written and well researched book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book on a plane while sitting next to a friend. We both fell in love with the story. We ended up asking the author for the book when it was released so we could read it together.  It's about 15 years later now and I still feel the same way about it.  This is the perfect blend of historical fiction with fairy tales.  I love historical fiction and this was the first book in this genre that I ever read.  The romance was great and I hope they will include it in future books.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading "Toward the Common Good: Economics for a Time of Growth and Change" by Thomas Piketty for some time now. I was a little skeptical about his assertion that economic growth was the key to the rising standard of living we all enjoy, so I didn't buy it. As it turns out, however, I had it exactly wrong. Pikettey is right about one thing: inequality. He also describes some of the reasons for that growing disparity. What he leaves out is the role of the public sector, which has had a lot to do with why we've all benefited from our rising standard. The public sector is a prime example of a big-government institution that actually produces large returns for the average citizen. I know this from having recently graduated from a public college and then spending some time working for a public-sector organization. After working for the government for several years, I've gained a whole new appreciation for the value of the role the government plays. It's especially impressive when you consider the number of government workers that exist in such a small amount of the population. If you're just starting out, the government can be daunting. But once you've got a solid grounding, it's often the right place to start your career.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been working on my novel for a year now, and I'm finally at the point where I can call myself a finished product.  After the book's author went into more detail than I could ever ask for about the background to the book, I knew that I could do a much better job than the one I've already done.  As a bonus, it was a very funny book to read.  I had to stop several times to laugh out loud.  The author uses the fact that he is so familiar with his subject matter to great effect.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book was important. I think that a lot of other people, especially those with a religious background, find themselves in a tough spot when they encounter homosexuality. They try to tell themselves that they aren't gay or they're not attracted to men, or they try to say that it's just a phase that will pass. But the book suggests that it won't. I also think that the book has some good ideas about how to deal with the problems of homosexuality, without making it all about how you feel. It's better than many others on the topic, because it tries to give the reader as balanced an understanding of the subject as possible. The author is quite well-spoken, and even if he's not so eloquent, the ideas he provides are good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm in the middle of a massive study of "literary" texts. Some of the classics I study are "Huckleberry Finn," "Anna Karenina," "Lord of the Flies," "The Great Gatsby," and so on.   This novel, "Fool for Love," by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, is a particularly good study text.  It is a very realistic portrait of the life and art of this great Russian writer.  The plot is extremely original and, while it may be difficult to follow at times, the language is easy to follow and the story has a very unique voice.  I love this novel and it's been my go-to reading for study and general enjoyment. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book tells of an incident that occurred some time ago at a place called The New School, where a young man is expelled for stealing a television. The story is told with great clarity and sensitivity, and is accompanied by fine photographs.   I have always admired the New School (or at least its philosophy), and while it may seem a bit too liberal for my taste, I have to say that this book is quite good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a great introduction to medieval warfare.  The book is well written and contains a wealth of information that most people would not know unless they had actually studied military history for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely love this book. It is full of beautiful, evocative language that perfectly captures the beauty of the book.  The prose is not so formal as to seem academic, but that's just a good thing.  This is a beautiful and evocative book, and it shows. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book  I thought it was very well written. The book is in the public domain and is a good reminder of the importance of not taking things for granted.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The reason I give this book 5 stars instead of 4 is that the "biblioblog" aspect makes it a lot more approachable than some of the more academic fiction I've read. I like having a book I can recommend to a wide audience, but it's a small price to pay for reading a great book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In her latest book, What Do We Eat When We Eat Badly? (Little, Brown and Company, January 2013) Katie Couric (the host of NBC's Katie, and a Pulitzer Prize winner) writes of her new book "What do we eat when we eat badly?," in which she looks at the connection between diet, weight, and health. She starts the book by noting that she had a difficult childhood because of her mother's obesity. But while she is critical of the food industry's role in causing obesity, Couric takes the easy way out and argues that the answer is to eat better! In her book, Cour, who has also had her share of weight problems herself, makes many excuses for people who diet and blame them for their problems. Couric also makes a few recommendations in the book. She says "We should eat the things we love most -- like fresh seafood, organic vegetables, and fruit -- and the foods we can't stand -- like high-calorie, white bread, fast food, sweets, and chips." But what if these foods are contributing to your weight problems and not helping? In the section "What Do We Cook?" Couric recommends that Americans try to cut down on food waste and limit how often they cook. This sounds sensible until you look at some of the foods listed in this section. For example, Cour and her co-author conclude that while a lot of people who have their fill of chips are eating a lot more, many of them are also eating far more food than they would if they had cut back on food. This suggests that a lot can be done to reduce food waste in America without actually reducing food consumption. However, Cour's recommendations of "Eat the things you love the most -- and what you can't bear -- and cut back" are a little hypocritical since she also suggests that people who are "eating more food" could also cut back a little. The section "Do You Eat 'Better' Than Your Parents or Older Brothers and Sisters?" offers several examples of what people have said are "healthier" versions of their parents' foods. Cour is clearly unaware that many of the "healthiest" versions actually contain far more calories, fat, and sodium than traditional versions. In fact, Cour acknowledges that most of these examples would make most people feel very ill! In the "What Does 'Healthier' Really Mean?" section, Cour is adamant that most people should "Stop using phrases like 'healthy
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is an excellent description of what is going on in the minds of the two main protagonists: James and Sue. The description is not overly long and descriptive but it helps you visualize what is really happening. In addition, the chapter "Sue's World" is excellent for giving the reader a good sense of the way Sue's thinking and actions have evolved over time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book - it's great for all ages and makes me want to start a garden.   This isn't the most scientific book out there but it is fun to think and has a good balance of facts and fun illustrations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book. It helps me see that some religious leaders (and other religious figures) were, in fact, quite decent human beings. The book makes a case that some of them were less bad than they were made out to be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book by a brilliant historian who was a good friend of mine for many years. He is very balanced in the things he says and does. The book discusses how people reacted to the Russian Revolution, how it affected their lives, and how it was a wake-up call for the whole country and for the rest of the world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. It's a nice balance between a historical novel and a fictionalized account of the period.   It's also good in terms of being a good read.  I thought that the characters and events portrayed were accurate and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. The authors are good, and the theme they explore is interesting. The writing style is somewhat dry and formal, but it doesn't prevent the book from being well-written and engaging. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book!  The main characters are well developed, the action is well paced, and the plot is easy to follow.  It's hard to put down when a good story keeps you hooked.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book, about the importance of public service. This book is well written, and is well-researched. It should be read by all those who care about the future of our country. I highly recommend this book to any American citizen who cares about our country and our democracy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very happy with this book.  It is very well-written and it presents its topics clearly and convincingly.   The book is not particularly educational.  But it does provide an excellent introduction to the history of women's involvement in the liberation struggle. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have heard so many good things about this book that I'm looking forward to reading it.  Although it has a slightly academic tone, the humor and candor in it is so entertaining that it's hard to put down.  While the book is primarily about marriage, there are lots of other topics in there, including the benefits of gardening and working together with your children, the advantages of a good education, how to pick the right spouse for you, and more.  It's funny, lighthearted, and informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of Peter Collier's fiction and poetry.  Collier is well known in the contemporary fantasy and urban fantasy circles.  The worldbuilding in the book is very well done and I appreciate the characters' diverse backgrounds.  This is the first in a series, but it does feel like it is the last one.  It is hard to put down 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. I really wanted to read about the experience of learning to speak English as a first language. It was very interesting and challenging to think about how I could be successful in this way. The author explains how she was able to learn this skill and how she applied it to her day-to-day life. It's good to know that I'm not the only one who was unable to do this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is such an easy read, even for the casual readers. I read it in the span of one evening because I felt it was too good not to share.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband read this in his freshman year at Harvard (I had recommended it to him). He found it very interesting and is still a fan. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was thoroughly entertained by this novel, which explores the fascinating and bizarre lives of a group of people who live near the Canadian border in Nova Scotia.  The characters are quirky, the plot complex, and the setting fascinating. The book is narrated by a variety of characters who have a variety reasons for wanting to stay in Canada, but the book does a good job of showing why they want to stay.  I'm so glad that I read this novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very engaging book that explores the historical development of the "Christian Right" from the 1960s to the present. I read it at a local library and loved it! I found it especially interesting because it covers the history of Christianity in a very non-judgmental way. The authors discuss the influence of a variety of social and economic factors on Christian theology, which is not surprising given the time frame and historical context of the book. The story is also interesting because of how the book covers the various factions of the Christian Right, both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in one sitting last fall and I think I'm going to reread it now.  The writing is clear, the plot is good, and the author does an excellent job explaining the religious and spiritual implications of the book's main character.  A highly recommended book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of useful information about how to survive in an apocalyptic world. I have been teaching survival for almost 30 years now. Some of my students still ask me, "If this world ends, how do we get out?" My answer is that if you can build a shelter, survive by scavenging and surviving off of garbage, you can survive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been waiting for a good biography of Gandhi to be written for a long time. This biography is much more than what I had hoped. The author makes excellent use of the Gandhi I grew up knowing and enjoying, while presenting a new perspective on the role he has played in the modern world. It is very well documented, with many archival sources and extensive interviews with Gandhi's family, friends, and associates. The book is written with a good sense of humor and a genuine interest in the man, who would often quote from his own essays and letters as he described his childhood.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been interested in writing my own fiction for a long time and have read many novels. I didn't think I'd ever like a book written by a woman; after all, I've always been drawn to the male voices. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It is an enjoyable and engaging read that I can confidently recommend to female readers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It is well written and filled with interesting information.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is sooo good   I'm a long time reader of science fiction.  This book takes you to some pretty interesting places... in the middle of space.. the moon.. and out into the vacuum of space.  It's an enjoyable read and, as usual, the ending is the best part. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am rereading  The Secret by John Leland. I just finished it over the holidays.  I have long felt the need to have a book that explains the mechanics and history of the Illuminati.   In an effort to be less gullible and more thorough, I read up on this group before my book.  For me, this group was important because, as a child, I had a very unhealthy relationship with my father.  The first time I met him, he came to visit my mother and told us that he was sending us to live with him and his wife.  He then informed us that our mother had died and he and his family would be running our home.  Since I was only nine years old at the time, he gave me some very stern advice about how I was to respond.  As a result of my mother's passing, I suffered from postpartum depression and became a very unhappy child.  During this time, my father and his second wife became my primary role models.  They were the people I looked to when I was struggling with problems like depression.  In my own life, I have been a strong and courageous person.  Unfortunately, this strength has often come in the face of difficulties.  At times, I was very depressed, unable to do anything, or just so afraid of the unknown that I retreated into the darkness of my mind.  Sometimes I thought that my father was the only reason I had been able to make it through those days.  Fortunately, one day, I saw my father looking down at me and said, "Daddy, you're a big boy and can do it yourself."  This was a very powerful moment for me.  It was like a floodgate was opened and I knew I could do better.  With his help, I slowly regained my confidence. I started to attend church regularly and felt my life was on the right path.  By the time I was fifteen, I thought I was well on my way.  Once I got my driver's license, I started driving myself, taking my Bible with me. I knew that God had a plan for my life and that He would guide me along the way. I always thought God would never allow me to be a part of the occult because of my religion.  Even as a young girl, I would pray for peace and happiness, but I never imagined the world would turn to shit.  However, I am so grateful
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was well researched and the information was easy to understand. I found the information on the Holocaust to be accurate and informative. I had previously heard about this part of the Holocaust in school but was not sure of the details. The research for this book was thorough and well done. I am glad to have found a good reference. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book for my own edification and enjoyment.  This is the first book I've read in a while that has been able to communicate something to me about something I'm interested in.  The title of the book is "How to Be a Good Muslim"   It is, indeed, very good.   When I first read the title, I was skeptical  and then I was intrigued.  It's a very good and easy read  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in a couple of sittings.  I think it is an excellent book.  It is full of very interesting information.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very well written and I was very impressed with the author's knowledge of historical and biographical facts. I was also very impressed by the author' s skill as a writer. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in studying World War I history or the U.S. Army. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first time I've read anything by David Shields and I can't say that I'm particularly impressed.  Shields's prose is excellent, and his themes are well thought-out but a little dry.  This may be due to the nature of the book: a series of fictional stories.  Some of the characters and events are obviously meant to be taken literally, but the stories are more likely to have been written to highlight the themes of certain characters or scenes.  The plot, meanwhile, is mostly a non-event.  Although Shields has written a few more books than the other "great" fantasy authors I mentioned in my reviews, I think he has gotten better with age.  In a time when his earlier novels were so good, I wonder if he really needs a book like this to keep his name in the public's mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers a subject that I'm trying to get my head around: the existence of the "New World Order".  It's certainly something that fascinates me, but also causes me much consternation.  I'm still unsure of my position on this topic, but I think I know what I want to say here.  As for the specifics, well, I'd say this: the "Pax Americana" was supposed to end with WWI, but then the U.S. actually fought WWII, which in turn triggered a major push by international banking interests to reestablish the Pax Americana.  (Remember the movie "The Godfather"?  That's exactly what happened: the Americans got their revenge on Italian criminals in the form of the Mafia.)  I really hope that's the end of this "New Age" nonsense, because it's a huge, distracting and annoying burden on people who want to make informed decisions and have a chance at a prosperous, prosperous future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is good. I like the way it looks.  The formatting is good and the information is useful.  I've used Google and Wikipedia for information but this book's index is better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was the most enjoyable book I've read in years. The writing was well-researched and well-written, with a great grasp of the theme and an entertaining story to boot.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read about how we are all connected.  A must for the curious, thoughtful, and committed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will be a keystone for the Christian education program I am running for my 12-year-old daughter, who is interested in the bible. This book has been a great comfort to me during her own questions about how to believe, what to believe about other issues, etc. The author explains and supports the Biblical position, makes many clear arguments, provides sound historical evidence, etc., etc. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book, although it took me a while to get into it.  It starts off very slow, but then picks up and gets very interesting at the end.  I especially liked the section on the science of memory, which is probably the most controversial part of the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book during a long summer break in my 20s. The book is about a 20-year-old guy, Peter, who decides to write a love letter to his girlfriend. It's an interesting look at the effects of a long-distance relationship, the problems it causes and the advantages it provides. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I didn't know much about the French language when I started reading "Le Livre des Noms," but once I saw the words "fonctionnaire," "foussier," "quiÃ©n," and "chez le roi," I knew that this was going to be a classic. I've been studying French since my early teens and can't imagine what it would be like to write a novel like this, and I can't wait to begin reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a way, "Dancing in the Dark" isn't just about "what is wrong with the world". "Dance" is more about what is right with the self. It takes us back to a simpler time, when we didn't have the internet to check social media constantly, nor did we have access to all of the media our modern culture has to offer. The book is also about the power of being true to ourselves, no matter what others say.  The first time I read it, I was in a serious relationship, and after a few months, we broke up. I felt terrible about the break up, because I had put so much effort into our relationship and I was so sure it would work. It wasn't easy, but I loved her more than I ever had before, and it made me sad. After a while, I started to realize that I hadn't given enough time to her. I was still going out with friends, but the relationship was just not the same. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first time I've read about the Japanese battle that claimed the lives of four American soldiers. It was the last day of training before the invasion of the Japanese home islands. The U.S. Army wanted to train in a mountainous area in western Japan that was difficult to access and was known to be the headquarters of the local Jap enemy. The Japanese insisted on training in the most rugged terrain imaginable. As part of the planning, the U. S. Army planned to have the Japanese destroy any bunkers, guns, and other defensive measures the U S. had built in preparation for the invasion. After the Americans arrived, the Japanese were surprised when the Americans came with large amounts of supplies. The Jap garrison opened fire on the Americans, but the Americans took care of the Jap with their bayonets. A few days after the U SS troops left, the Americans found four bodies in a ravine. All four were American soldiers killed by Japanese bullets. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I first read this book about a month ago.  Â It was a fast read and the plot was interesting.  I liked the idea of the two worlds coming together in the end and it all seemed to fit together.  It is hard to get into it because it takes a long time for the two parts to connect.  But I really liked the characters and their lives. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've already recommended this book to a friend.  The author's personal history gives a great insight into his experience during his time as a student.  His descriptions of life during his early years, as a kid growing up in a religious household and attending church, are incredibly moving.  This book makes the reader feel like he is reliving his life and has a unique perspective on the world he inhabits.  A must-read for any student or educator with a love of the written word. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is the kind of book that the whole family can enjoy -- children, grandparents and the whole extended family.  It also makes an excellent Christmas present for a friend, and for me, who has had difficulty getting into reading books for a long time, this book was a welcome reprieve. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the idea of a person with multiple personality disorder and how it relates to the mental health of the family. I read this book to my sister who is a counselor and a mom to a teen with BPD and bipolar disorder. She was a BPD patient and her mother who suffered with Bipolar Disorder.   This book was very eye-opening for her and she said it gave her hope for the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am writing this review after reading The Maintaining Truth: A Memoir of Courage and Healing by Susan Faludi.  Faludi's personal story of courage and healing is inspirational and is the perfect jumping-off point for anyone wanting to examine issues of gender and feminism in the 21st Century.  At the same time, Faludi uses her own experiences and personal struggles with women's issues to teach us all a little about what it's like to be a woman who is also a feminist, which is the primary message that comes across in her book.  I read The Maintainance of the Faith: A Manual for Christian Domestic Discipline and found it to be very helpful, and I plan to use it as a book companion and resource for my own faith life.  In my experience, Christian women are often encouraged to stay in traditional gender roles, which leads to a lot of anger, resentment, and depression.  Many women, in spite of being strong in the face of abuse, are also depressed and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their marriages.  The M, as Faludi refers to it, provides a practical manual of Biblical and religious principles and practice to help you navigate a path to recovery.  It also provides a glimpse of the personal pain that often results from the struggle with maintaining a feminist position within the Christian home.  And I think it's a good thing to have at hand when trying to be strong when it matters the most. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read many books about religion and the Bible. I especially liked the Bible itself. I liked the stories it told. I enjoyed the historical context. I appreciated the accuracy of many details. I admired the depth of the theology. I also appreciated that some of the authors were also Christians.    The Good Book can be a bit confusing at times, but once you understand it, it is a very enjoyable read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was given a copy of this book as part of a collection of her articles about the New York Times, so I was aware of her background.  I've enjoyed reading her articles on the Times and enjoyed her book on the Wall Street Journal.  Although I enjoyed the Journal, this was my first experience with the New Yorker.  However, this wasn't a bad book.  While the title "A Bad Choice: The Worst of Hillary Rodham Clinton" seems a bit self-serving, it does provide a good picture of her career to date.  She had some bad decisions that contributed to her loss, and her decision to go after the Clintons in 2000 contributed to the loss of the presidency.  At the end of the day, I think she made some very good decisions.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a fun and very well done book. I would recommend it to anyone who has a love of the genre of science fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very skeptical when I was sent this book, but I couldn't wait to get it and I've been completely satisfied.   It's very entertaining and a good reminder to be positive and keep a positive attitude. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read "Walking the Talk" last night as I was driving to work, and I thought that it was a great read. I thought it was written with the same clear and direct prose style that I've been reading lately from Jim Hines and David Brooks. I also liked that it showed how people can change their lives when they realize that they are willing to do what needs to be done to be successful. I was looking for a good story about a person I know who has managed to make it in the business world, and this was the best one I've found. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have long had the sense that John Irving had been writing something for himself and that the finished work was destined to be an enormous success. This book gives me every reason to believe that it will be. This is Irving's best book yet and will no doubt find a permanent place on the bookshelf of any serious book lover.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to read this book three times before I was completely satisfied with it.  It begins with a good description of the history of the English language, which includes the various ways in which different languages have been used by different groups of people over time.  I found myself very interested in this aspect, and I was glad to find this section of the book.  Next we get an overview of how the English spelling system works, and some of the reasons why English spelling is the way it is.  The final chapter covers the history and the future of English spelling.  Here the author gets to the nitty-gritty.  Some of the topics he covered: The pronunciation of the letter c :  In ancient times, c was pronounced 'c' like the "y" in "yelp" (and other consonants).  Then the word was taken from Latin and pronounced "co" like a "y". Â  However, the pronunciation changed again in the Middle Ages.  In Middle English, c became "ck" like "ch", which was the pronunciation in Old English.  But even then, some people still pronounced it as "ck", which in modern English is pronounced "ch". Â  The letter w :  The letter "w" is pronounced with a long, nasal, airy "w".  Some people pronounce it with a very short "u", which is why the letter is still pronounced "w."  But I prefer to say that the "w' is pronounced as it was originally, which is with a short "w", and I prefer that pronunciation anyway. Â  It would be great if "w"'s pronunciation in modern, proper English changed to sound like the pronunciation of "w'" in "wicked" (or, if I might suggest, "whore"). Â  The letters x and y :  x and o were used interchangeably for many years, but x was always pronounced as "x", whereas o was pronounced "oo".  I prefer the old pronunciation. Â  The alphabet : Â  The symbols used for some of our letters changed over time as well.  Now they have their own letters that don't match the ones they used to be called, and you can't write down a letter that you can only write with its abbreviation. Â  And since these symbols are used in a wide variety of languages, there are a lot of ways to write them.  For example, the "l" in the
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book!  It's well written, with many examples of how to get things right and how to make bad decisions.   My favorite example in the book is the decision to use a bad thermometer:  "We decided that the best way to test whether the thermometer was accurate was to cook some eggs on the stovetop.  I had always assumed that cooking at very low temperatures would cause cooking eggs to cook slowly, and that's exactly what happened.  After all, how can you tell if a piece of glass is perfectly clean when it's been sitting in hot water for a week?"   This book is also about how a poor decision can be remedied, especially when the consequences are not immediately apparent.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book, and am so impressed by the way she takes the time to tell her readers exactly how they should think and what they should do. The best part of the book is how her ideas are presented and explained without being too complicated or confusing. She starts with a simple premise, that humans have an inherent love for nature and for the natural world. She then gives several examples of how animals in captivity are treated just as they would be in the wild, and how people treat them as though they're mere possessions rather than living, thinking animals. Her conclusion is that animals in the US should be able to keep their freedom as a matter of right, without having to be subjected to cruel practices. This is an absolutely brilliant book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great. It has so much depth, wisdom, and knowledge of psychology, that you have to go through a lot to really get the full benefits. There is some heavy, very heavy psychological topics that are covered in a very practical and easy-to-follow fashion. If you are a bit more in tune with your subconscious mind, you may find it useful. If your inner critic isn't that kind of person, you will probably find the book too much, and that's a good thing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished    and I'm pretty much in love with it.  It's written in the   "we're all different"   vein and has a lot of really well written examples   to help the reader come to a conclusion.  There's a lot in this book to chew on, so I'm glad I didn't stop at just one chapter.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book on writing ever written, period. It's concise and simple, yet manages to do exactly what it says it will. It tells you the best way to break a story down into paragraphs and paragraphs into paragraphs, how to put in the appropriate amount of descriptions to tell the reader about the action or setting, and the best words to use to do so. It also teaches you the importance of character-driven stories in a way that's both easy to understand and still very entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, but it has a good message, and I learned a lot about myself and about life.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book for my college library and read it within a week. I was so impressed with it that I bought the entire series.   In this series the women, even those with no prior relationship, are treated fairly and respectfully and the relationships between the characters are treated with a good deal of honesty. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! This is a very good and clear explanation of the history of the Church. It is full of fascinating details and interesting characters, like the "wasp" who was the first Church official who refused to change her name, and the women who had to wear special dresses. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book.  I have found that there are no two opinions of the Bible that are exactly the same. This book does a fine job of balancing all the opinions out to provide a balanced view of the scriptures.  It was written from the perspective of the Protestant church and therefore is not in-depth about every aspect of the religion.  However, it does a great job of showing that both Protestants and Catholics believe many of the same things.  This book will definitely be on my "must read list" 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very impressed with this book, but not in the way I expected.   The book starts with some general historical context about the Middle East, which has had a rich and complicated history.  However, the author then jumps straight into the discussion about the recent Arab uprisings.  While this was well-written, it did feel like an afterthought for the main focus of the book.  It also felt like an odd choice given the book's title.  The other chapters were well written and had some interesting insights, but the discussion on the Arab Spring was a poor choice for the author.  If the author really wants to talk about the past, I would recommend getting other authors to help with the background. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was looking forward to this book for some time and finally got around to it. I am so glad I did!  I enjoyed every minute I spent with it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a must read for all students. It is the first time I have tried to teach young people what is wrong with a certain kind of thought.   The author clearly explains the problem as being primarily one of language and what it leads one to believe.  The book clearly demonstrates that such a thought is wrong.  This is particularly important for teachers who want to teach children to be aware and question the things that they read in books, as well as being able to question what others say in the way that they talk. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a deep interest in science and the natural world, but I never got the chance to study these subjects before. The books on ecology I used to read growing up, on animals and plants, had a clear, authoritative tone.  This one was written in a way that was approachable, but not overly academic.  It focused on ecological issues, but also gave a general overview of human history.  I think I enjoyed this book a lot more than I did my previous books on the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A good and entertaining book: It contains a lot of information about a very interesting topic: how people can get better at writing.  It is clear that Ms. Taylor has taken an intelligent and diligent interest in the subject, and it is clear from her writing that she also knows how to present her findings clearly and concisely.  She explains the concepts in a non-technical way, so that no technical skills are required.  I will read the book again to learn more."
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The book's basic thesis--that religion is, at root, fear, superstition, and ignorance--is a very difficult concept to accept.   I have had to face the reality that religion isn't as harmless as many people assume it is, that the very basis of our religion, Christianity, is essentially fear and superstition.  And that in its most extreme forms, that is, the fundamentalist form, that religious fundamentalism is actually the opposite of the kind of religion that I actually believe in:  It's based on good values and the search for truth, but it's not based on ignorance or fear.  As the author says in the book, there are many people who don't have anything against their religion, who just think that they're too busy for religion, or can't make a commitment, or don't feel connected to it on a personal level.  But those people are usually the ones who end up leaving their religion for good.  I think it's the opposite: The people who stick with their religion because they genuinely feel connected and connected to God aren't necessarily the ones whose religious convictions are at the root of their fear.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A truly enjoyable story, from the author's own experiences and observations.  A story that makes you want to be in the thick of the action, and learn about the real-life dangers that others face while in the military.  The descriptions of the military are realistic, and the military life seems to hold little for the "means" of obtaining the results, and most people are not happy with the results.  As well as the realism, the author makes an effort to use humor to keep the reader engaged in the story, and is one of the few authors who has tried to write about military life from multiple viewpoints.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating book on the history of our species, in all its complexity and diversity.   This book is full of insights that might be of use to the many people interested in the origins and growth of our planet.  I've already used some of the examples in my own thinking, as I have discovered some of these ideas in the works of various scientists, especially Dr. Richard H. Loomis, the scientist whose work has been used as an excellent example in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't know why I chose this one to read. The whole premise sounds kind of cheesy, and I'm not really into books that are really about sex (even though I know a lot of sex-negative feminists like it).  This is one of those sex-positive, non-feminist books that I have to read and say, "Uh-oh."  It seems that the author has done more than a little research (on the Internet, no less), and in many cases, I felt that the research was just "sheer opinion."  While it's true that there are some feminists who feel that pornography (and, really, just porn) does not negatively affect sex in any way, it's not like these women have the "scientific" expertise that the book claims.  I would have thought that a scientist would have had some kind of expertise in sex.  The author uses a few examples of women who say that pornography had a positive effect on them, and uses that as evidence for her case (though, I have no idea why these women would be using this as evidence).  As far as I can tell, there's only one actual study on the subject, and it was conducted at a Christian university (which is to say, it is not scientific), and that study found no significant effect from pornography.  While the book states that the other women "could be liars," the only thing they were saying was that the pornography didn't affect them.  This kind of evidence, especially from Christians, just sounds like a bunch of people trying to make the Bible fit their personal opinions rather than evidence based on scientific studies.  And, I mean, come on, even if the study were true, that doesn't really tell us anything.  It was a Christian study, and that doesn t mean that Christian opinions always hold up.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this remarkable book by one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century, Richard Rorty, the "American system" is defended with a certain panache, with the precision and precision of an archaeologist who has uncovered a hidden tomb. Rortys argument goes right to the heart of American exceptionalism and explains why its flaws and its hypocrisies are such compelling subjects for analysis.  He is very successful in putting the American system on display for all to see in all its various manifestations -- not just the politics of the United States.  Rortyan writing is very crisp, and he doesn't get bogged down in the minutia of political rhetoric.  Instead, he makes the American social, political, and economic systems clear and simple.  And he makes it clear that the problem is deeper than any of the specific policies of any political party.   Rorting makes a convincing case that the American political system is a highly structured, systematic machine which is designed to serve the interests of the ruling class.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had not read this book before but decided to give it a chance after hearing good reviews from others about it.  I found it very interesting and the ending is quite a shocker.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading and re-reading some of the authors of The Selfish Gene (as well as some other books that I don't remember reading) and this one seemed the most compelling to me.  The story is compelling and the science is compelling.  I had trouble deciding which one was more compelling and that really is the problem that some people have with this book: it's not so easy to make a case. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this in print and have now got a Kindle version. I've been looking for a good, practical guide on how to become a successful author for a long time. This book is the one I've found that answers my questions, and makes it possible for me to succeed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was the best thing I've read since George RR Martin's Game of Thrones. If you've ever thought you might have a crack at writing a fantasy book or series, I can recommend The Land of Glass as an ideal starting point.   In particular, The Land is an interesting take on a number of fantasy archetypes: the warrior-priest, the wizard-priests, the dragon-riding princess, the warrior princess, and the warrior leader.  The plot is interesting as well, and although it doesn't quite follow the structure of traditional fantasy novels, the characters do develop into interesting people over the course of the book.  Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and I can't wait to hear more from the author.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book!  This is a good introduction to Buddhism, and it explains the Buddhist worldview much better than I had thought.   It doesn't try to be too difficult or jargon-filled, but it still offers a solid overview of Buddhism.  While it is true that there are many differences between Buddhism and other world religions, I can't help but think that the similarities outweigh the differences, at least for those of us who have been raised in a Buddhist culture. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received a copy of this book recently from a goodreads.com friend.  It's the book I was looking for in my research into early Christian history, so it's a good choice for my next reading.  I am especially glad that this is an original translation, since many other translations are based on other ancient writings.  (The Oxford Companion to the Bible has a great one-volume overview of early Christian scholarship.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have had several books on the topic of suicide, and these have all been very helpful. This one, in particular, was very helpful in that it described the physical act of a suicide attempt, which is a very difficult thing to do, both for the person who attempts suicide and for the loved ones who come to help. It did not make the act appear as "normal" and "normal-like" as it had in the earlier books. I think the authors probably knew this. It made it more credible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. I am a big fan of science fiction, but this book is much better than I expected.   The first section, which is mostly about space travel, is very well researched.  The discussion of space flight, radiation, and the need to have equipment to control the effects is good.  But the rest of the book is about the consequences of those things.  I think this is why the book appeals to me so much: it shows the importance of being careful with the things that you take for granted.  It is much easier to take something for granted if you never really have to deal with it.  There is a good discussion in the book about the importance (or lack of it) of technology in science fiction.  This has been a subject of much speculation.  Science fiction writers like Arthur C. Clarke have argued that it is impossible to accurately predict what technology will be available in the future.  Others believe it is possible, but it would take a long time.  Clarke is a firm believer in the latter camp, but he has always said that he would be disappointed if technology was not used in his stories.  That is one of the reasons why I like the book so much.  Of course, science fiction writers aren't the only ones with their own opinions on the topic.  However, even the strongest defenders of the technology of the future still need to be careful with what they take for fact.  A book about space flight should have an explanation of the effects of space travel on the human body, for example.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found it to be a useful and well-researched overview of the relationship between the American legal system and the Native American population in North America. The title of the book is a reference to the famous 1858 Supreme Court decision that established the existence of Native American "race," which has since been overturned by subsequent Supreme Court rulings. This decision has made a number of people think that they can treat Native Americans like people who are legally "black," or have "mental retardation," or "disabled" on account of their ancestry. This is an example of the way in which "blackness" can be perceived to have no relation to one's true racial identity, but which, in fact, has a huge amount of association with the actual people who were black in the relevant times and places.  I was particularly interested in learning more about how the U.S. legal system deals with people who have a genetic history of being of Indian ancestry.  What is the difference between having a "race" and having a genetic predisposition to have the "wrong" "race"?
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been enjoying these books so much that I just gave them all away!   These authors are the real deal, and I'm glad to have found them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was in college. My first reaction was, "Oh, no! You're going to be the next one to get this book." My other reaction was something along the lines of, "You're sure you're not the only one who thinks this way? This is ridiculous." But the thing I noticed, and have since seen in so many other books, is that you're right. The idea that we're all fundamentally the same, that our interests aren't all that different, that we can all understand each other, that there's no real "other," is ridiculous. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read The White Donkey when I was just about to get married. I was hooked on the books as soon as I read about the marriage of a White donkey and a Black donkey.   The stories were so realistic and so wonderful that I decided to write my own.  As for the book itself, I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. It is both informative and entertaining. In addition, it is a fascinating study of social institutions.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a long time fan of The Great Gatsby. I've been looking for a book by that name since I was a child. I read the audiobook, and was glad I did. This book takes its source material very seriously. It is a fascinating book, not because of Gatsbys and the Gatsbey Club, but because of the people they influence.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much.  This book, unlike many of the other books on the same subject, provides a solid discussion of the scientific evidence for global cooling.  I was very skeptical about the claims that the IPCC was making, but this book convinced me that the data was clear that global warming was happening.   My husband thought the book was a bit too optimistic, but that could have been due to the fact that he was too tired to be skeptical.  Overall, it was good.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had never heard of the book before I finished it, but it ended up being a great experience. The author describes the book as a "curse" and gives a list of reasons why it is cursed: (1) it was written in a period when the author was deeply depressed; (2) the author had trouble writing about himself; (3) the book was written when the authors were in the midst of a difficult break up; (4) the authors' relationship was dysfunctional; and (5) the characters are difficult to read.   Overall, I thought the book improved as the author got better at writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great story that was well written and I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A book that I will keep on my shelf for years. I am always searching for new ways to use my hands and learn new skills.  My book is exactly that: a collection of hands-on skills that I can use to do many different things.  The chapters are broken up by different subjects - like how to write a better rÃ©sumÃ©, how to use a camera, and the value of a good computer system (and why that isn't so useful).  If I were on an astronaut flight to Mars, this book would be a must-have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fun, fun, good book.  There are so many quotes and funny stories in this book. I especially liked how Mr. Gann said "When I was in college I thought I was going to be a journalist. Well, I'm not. I'm a writer." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great introduction to the field of ancient Greek philosophy.  It begins with the concept of a soul that is the opposite of the body, and goes on to explain what Socrates meant when he said: "You don't believe you've been born, do you? But you know that you've lived, and that you will die" ( p. 19). Â  The book is organized by subject matter, and includes the philosophy of Plato ( p. 19).  There is also a good discussion of Socrates' life, his writings, and his influence.  I hope that the next time I use Plato as an example of a good philosopher I will have the book on me (I have not yet read all the others in this series). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a fine primer on the many differences between the Christian and the secular world. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the religious aspect of secularism. The arguments made are persuasive. The book itself will be of interest to those interested in philosophy and the history of religion.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've enjoyed reading the biography of Charles Darrow so much that I've actually decided to commit his story to memory: I read it years ago, and as a result, I now know more about Darrow than I ever knew about him. Even before this book, I thought it was possible that Darrow was an insane, criminal, psychopathic loon. But Darrow's own writing is so impressive, so compelling, that I'm willing to give him a pass in his earlier work. And in this book (which I'll probably reread many times) he reveals the details of his personal life to a remarkable degree. His first marriage was doomed from the start. He had to divorce his second wife in a custody battle that turned out to be a disaster for both of them. He has never married again. After his divorce from his third wife, he went through a period in which he spent most of his time in isolation, but he managed to find a second wife and have children, all while serving time in prison. This is the sort of thing that can happen to a crazy person, or people who are mentally ill, when they're not careful. I'll give Darrow a pass for his early career in psychiatry, but I would not recommend him for his later work.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am writing this review after finishing The Road Less Traveled  I thought this book was good. I have to be honest, I thought it was terrible. It is not a bad book in and of itself but it is definitely a bad re-telling. I was expecting to enjoy it, but I hated it. My first impression of this book is that it was just so-so, not bad but not great either. The re-tellings were fun but the real story was so bad that I was not interested. I felt like the author tried too hard to be original with his ideas and ended up using the same plot that has been done many times before. Maybe his goal was to get a big publishing deal but I just didn't buy it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first in a series I'm reading calledÂ  The Good Old Days    It's the classic story of the Great Depression. The book itself is good, and very well written.   However, it's not really a story of economic prosperity. It's more of a story about a group of people coping with depression in a hopeless economic climate.  While it's well written, the main character's depression seems almost unrealistic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've had a hard time understanding the concept of "sane" (as opposed to "insane" or "pathological") behavior. It seems like it's always about a person's "lifestyle" and how he/she has managed to avoid the pitfalls of certain behaviors, and has "healed" from them and is now "happy".  It always strikes me as more interesting if it's someone's "personal history," which means they've been given permission to do things they never would have considered, and therefore it gives them a chance to explain how their life choices were a result of their own thinking.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first biography I've read with a woman's perspective. It's very nice of her to include many women and also mention their personal tragedies. I'm a woman and I have to say I feel much more comfortable talking about myself and my feelings in a book like this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book on the Bible and church history. I read this in one day after finishing all the other Christian classics on my shelf. The Bible is a fascinating subject for Christians and non-Christians alike. I'm a Christian myself, but I do not agree with many of the teachings in the Bible. This book explains some of the more obscure Biblical passages from a non-biased perspective. I especially appreciated the explanation of the 'Hebrew Code' in the book. I think many people know this but never give it much thought. I really like this book."
Write a positive review about a good book:   In the end, this is about the most well-researched and documented work of UFOlogy that I have read. It is not easy to accept the veracity of sightings, but there seems to be a lot more of this going on than anyone ever suspected. It's been hard to stay skeptical of the reports, but once you do, the evidence becomes overwhelming. The book contains so many testimonies that I had to read them all myself and put them in a "who's-who" list.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was recently reading some interesting material on modern culture, specifically the rise of the internet, at my library, and was struck with a quote from a book about American religion.  The book's author stated that the best way to explain the growth of American religion was to compare it to the growth in the growth rate of the Internet.  I thought that was interesting, and thought about it a lot.   It is certainly the case that the Internet has helped the church grow.  It was something that we all thought was great about the Internet and yet it was also something that led many to leave the church.  And that certainly seems to be happening to the internet.  But I think the real question is, why?  Is it because of the church's teachings, or because of what people find on the Internet?  I do find that the Bible is often cited in support of the concept of the net (particularly the book of Romans)  but it is also worth noting that many of the things we find on social media can be attributed to social media in the first place.  When my husband has to get up at 3:00 a.m. to make a call that has no business being made at 3 a. m., or that requires a huge time investment, I think of the time that the church gave to such things and it makes me wonder why we're spending so much time doing something that has little to do with the church and everything to do only with our own time and desire to get the information we want. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, from one of my favorite authors, is a good example of how a book can make the writer's life easier.  This is the first book I've read that uses the concept of "self-talk" to explain human behavior: in other words, the way we think about ourselves.  The book, which is written in a clear style and with a lot of examples, covers a variety of topics: the importance of having a self-talk journal; the different ways that we use self-descriptions to make decisions; the "I" versus "We" mindset; the effects of self-disclosure on relationships; and the benefits of being mindful of our thoughts.  There's a lot here for anybody interested in mental health, but especially for anyone who is going to be on the receiving end of self talk. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book was a great addition to my shelf, and I wish it had been around when I was growing up.   The main character, a young girl named Lisa, is the daughter of a man who suffers from mental illness, and she is forced to deal with his issues.  Lisa is brave, funny, and funny in ways that make me laugh out loud every time.  I love the "I got drunk, saw a naked woman and fell in love" story, which I think is a classic.  While the book is focused on mental illness and depression, it is written in a way that I think kids can relate to, as well.  It doesn't contain profanity or violence.  There are references to popular songs and movies that are still enjoyable to me as a child, but at the same time, I think Lisa's love of music and movies is very relatable to young girls who struggle with mental illness.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good book about how to be a better person, which I think is very common. I would recommend it to anyone who is not quite as nice as they think they are. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Crowley's book is as informative, well written, and well-researched as a scholarly book can be. As the author notes, the work contains over 100 references, which is quite uncommon in an academic book about an American religious movement." -- Richard Dolan, University of Denver, Colorado
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book does a good job of setting up and detailing a historical account of a group of American anarchists from 1868 to the 1880s.  The material is well-researched and accessible to students of American history.  A valuable contribution to our understanding of American anarchism.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book.  The information is good, the examples are interesting, and the writing is clear.   There are a number of good suggestions for how to use statistics in your writing, and a number that should be done in all of your writing.  In addition, there is a section on creating a professional looking journal.  I found this to be a good refresher on the basic idea behind journaling, especially in a professional setting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a pretty typical post-apocalyptic tale. The characters have to fight against all sorts of evil. The villains are pretty generic, but the heroes have a certain charm and the story is told from their point of view. The book's ending was pretty good too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm currently reading the first three books of the Harry Potter series in my spare time.  I found the books very enjoyable, and the authors' knowledge of the franchise is well-researched.  The author does a good job of introducing the characters, while giving their individual stories a sense of cohesion.  Although the series is already long enough that there's no point in reading a third book right now, it's always nice to know the author has a plan for future books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very pleased that this book came out in English. I've read books on Buddhism that have been published in Spanish. Unfortunately, the authors had a poor grasp on the subject and often made mistakes that they had to correct. Their writing was, at times, clumsy, sloppy, and even incomprehensible.   In my opinion, their only redeeming feature was that their aim was to write about a Buddhist "religion" -- not an academic study of it -- rather than a religion or "religious" organization.  Despite this, this book was so well researched and written that I was very much satisfied with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read " The Power of Positive Thinking " back in the late 1960's. I was completely captivated by this "spiritual guru," who was convinced that every single thing that happens in his life is because of his "positive thinking." The book's title was one of my favorites; "positive," for lack of a better word, being my favorite word.  I've always had a hard time believing that the positive thinking mindset could actually make anything happen, but he argued that it could. His book was my first introduction to a certain kind of "positive" thinking.  So many people say that "you can't make something happen unless you try," but I'd like to see what that really means.  There's more to life than trying. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much.  A few of the things I learned were not well-known; but they were well-described, and they were really useful.  One of the problems with the Internet (and other media) is that it is so easily misused; yet there were some examples of good uses in this book.  The idea of "skeuomorphism" is useful; it should be used to explain how a system can be simplified in order to make it easier to use.  In this book, the concept of a "semantic" system is used.  "Semantic" is a synonym for "semantics"; so the authors use the concept in many places, as an explanation of how a computer program should work.  Also, they use the word "semantical" when it means "semantically meaningful."  For example, they say that "In the case of a semantical system that is being used to organize a database, an attempt to apply the principle of conservation of meaning may be considered an instance of an 'unconsciously semantistical' solution."  Another example, used for "skeptical" reasons, is how the notion of "semaphoric" seems to be defined in different ways.  When I see the word, I understand its meaning; but the authors say it may mean different things.  However, they also explain that "semipurposeful" means "having an indefinite number of possible meanings," so that "emphasizing one meaning over another does not necessarily entail an increase in semantic density."  It appears that the authors think the concept applies only to English language.  I hope it doesn't mean that English speakers can only use a limited number of meanings, but I guess I'll have to see how it works in the real world.  Another good thing the authors discussed is "parallelism"; that is, a word may have the same meaning in different languages.  This is useful for understanding what words mean in different cultures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for kids who are just getting into reading or are about to embark on one. In the book, I thought that the illustrations were simple enough for kids to get a good feel for the characters and their relationships. It was a quick read and the illustrations are great.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Book of God was an eye-opening and life-changing read.  I had read the book reviews on Goodreads, but I found the authors to be too optimistic in their assertions.  Even the reviewer who claimed the book was flawed said he was glad God didn't read the final product.   While I still felt that the author's assumptions were too hasty, I found a good deal of truth in his arguments and felt a deep sense of gratitude for the opportunity to find the truth for myself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. The information was interesting, and I had my doubts as to whether the information was reliable. However, with the benefit of reading several other books about the Church before I started reading this one, I was able to put those doubts aside and be satisfied with the information contained in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fantastic. I read it back in 2010 and was very pleased. A simple, easy to understand overview of many of the major topics in ecology. I used it as an introduction to my undergrad biology courses at Stanford. I've never been a fan of the "glorified biology" that is so popular today, but I definitely recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Gloriousness in the form of a child's song about the end of the world."    When my younger sister went to college, she discovered a copy of this book in a bookshop.Â  It is absolutely fantastic.Â  The narrator is a little girl and sings, "The end is coming soon, oh, oh!"  I bought the book to read to my younger children when my little one was younger, but I find it even more enjoyable when read aloud.Â  In my younger days, I used to sing "The End Is Near" with my children to cheer them up after a rough day.Â  I also like to watch "The Day the Earth Stood Still."
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is fantastic. I had to reread it several times in order to absorb the details of the various characters. And I have to admit that I was not entirely satisfied with the ending. But I understand the intention behind it: it is meant to show that there is hope for humanity even in the most hostile of circumstances. I'm not sure why the final act of the book was so unsatisfying. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had wanted to read this book for a long time, but I was just never able to make it happen. I finally got around to it this year, and I enjoyed it. The author is very good at showing how the world works, and the way people behave, but is never too heavy-handed in his descriptions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book a wonderful reflection on how human nature and the human race can influence and change each other's lives. While the main characters were primarily a set of young, upper middle class white Americans, the authors also included several Asian Americans, including the characters of two Korean Americans and two Chinese Americans. The book follows these people throughout their lives as they navigate the different cultural aspects of their immigrant backgrounds in the U.S. The authors also give the characters individual, often tragic and humorous stories, which help the reader to better understand their characters and the cultural influences that affect their lives.   This is a very interesting book about human nature that I highly recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The plot is so cool, so original, so well-executed...so interesting that you want to read the whole thing!  And as an added bonus (because I couldn't resist) the author gives a shout-out to "the good old days" when kids were supposed to read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not very impressed with this one. It has a number of excellent ideas but the writing is so sloppily put together and the argument so flawed that it falls flat.  I can see why he wrote it, and I'm certainly not complaining, but it just doesn't work for me.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book by the great Stephen King just before I began writing my own novels.  This is a great book for both horror and the Stephen King literary style  The writing is solid, the plot is intriguing and the characters are all believable and well developed.   There is so much to love about this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was reading "S.M.A.R.T. - The System for Managing Alternative Means of Resisting, Retaliating, and Avoiding..." on the bus, I noticed that the author used the phrase "modes of resistance and retaliation" to describe what he called "alternative methods of resistance" used in the resistance to "the Vietnam War." I was immediately reminded of the use of the phrase by a group of students at a state university in my state, who after they had found out that their program for improving their academic performance was actually a lie, staged a protest by not taking exams and not studying, and then had the integrity to admit it and resign. When the university president told the students that the school's response to this action was to require them to take an even more humiliating exam, they said they would not take it because the lie had been revealed, and that their protest was not a refusal of an exam but a refusal to answer one, and they felt that they had a right to refuse because the university was doing a disservice to their intelligence by requiring them to pass the exam that they would never need to take. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was the best book I read this year.  I love historical novels, and so do my three teenage sons, so I usually end up reading quite a bit of nonfiction when we have family over.   While not my favorite history book this year, this one stands out as the best for its detail, depth, and analysis.  It will have a lasting impact on my view of the Civil War. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Â This is the kind of book you want to read over and over and never get tired of.   It tells the story of the American War for Independence in a very clear and precise way.  The authors are excellent writers and I especially enjoyed the way they used the American Revolution in their writing.  This book has a lot of great information, and I found myself wondering if this is the best book about the American Revolutionary War that's been written.  If you read the book you can see that it's a pretty close call. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best thing about this book is that it is not just about the history of American women: it's about the way women in America have changed. It tells us about women who started the first organized women's rights movement; women who founded women's colleges and universities; women like Emma Goldman who changed the world with her opposition to the draft, and the women who worked to secure the right to vote for women. This book makes a number of arguments about why it's wrong to call women's actions "suffragist" and "un-American," but I think it's the author's insight into how much progress we've made since the 19th century that's the real story here. The idea that women were "a nation of cowards" who "would rather be safe than free" is not the truth. The women who protested, led the fight for the right of black men to vote, and fought for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act have been forgotten or even lionized, while the women today who oppose abortion rights, oppose affirmative action, oppose the war on drugs, and have joined other women in their resistance to the misogynistic War on Women are either dismissed or ignored. This is why I think this book helps the women of today, but it also helps the men of the past, who have never experienced the same level of women's empowerment or the same levels of backlash. In fact, women's liberation in America was only achieved with a degree of "collateral damage" to other people's rights. So while the book is primarily about women, it's important to recognize that the same history can be said about men too, if only they were not so blind to the struggles of other people and so self-satisfied about their own superiority.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful introduction to the life of Abraham Lincoln 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am currently reading "An Anatomy of Love." It's the second book I've bought in this series and I've enjoyed the first ( "An Education"). The book covers all the bases, and does so in a very clear, and entertaining fashion. While I think that love is the most fundamental human experience, I also understand that there are many other emotional states (for instance, sadness and anger are very different from one another and do not automatically come with the territory). This book explores many emotional states through the eyes of a woman who is in love with a man who has a "terrible heart." Her love is based on his ability to make her laugh and to share her pain. I'm glad she's making her feelings known, and am happy that she's sharing her thoughts. I think the fact that her "terribly hard heart" has a hard side of its own might be a good sign. It would certainly be better to have that side of him, which is probably more responsible, than the side which is often overlooked or dismissed. The fact that he makes her laugh is really a good point: laughter, like any other, can be painful or even downright harmful (although the kind that he shows her is very much worth sharing with her, as she will find out later). One interesting part of the book: the author argues that the best way to deal with a bad heart is to turn it into a good heart. If you treat it like a bad organ, you're more likely to love it back in return (the fact that she doesn't see him as a bad person, but instead as a good one, is interesting).
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is amazing!  I am a student in a graduate program in science writing and have been reading about how to write a scientific article for over a year now. I have finally taken the plunge.  It's been an absolute joy reading this book.  Dr. A.E. Denton (a brilliant scientist) has put it all together so well.  All of his tips are very easy to follow and give me a lot of insight on how to succeed in science.  I love his advice about getting started, how to think about your research, and even how to approach a difficult topic in a calm and organized manner.  The end of the book has some great suggestions about dealing with the press, but I'm still finding a way to have fun with this too 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've enjoyed reading about so much of what I love about literature and the arts. This is a very good book and I appreciate the thought that went into each of the chapters.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The two booklets of essays (on which the audiobook is based) are quite helpful.  I'm going through them now and have already learned a lot.   It's not as if the authors have been traveling the world talking to people (which I don't believe they have), but there is a great deal of practical information, such as how to choose your own vacation spot, or how to find a good travel partner.  They also include lots of fun stories from their own travels, which is a nice change from the standard travel writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great introduction to the history of early Islam and the role of Muslim rulers in the formation of the Muslim world.  This text has an excellent cover design that is an excellent representation of the Islamic tradition.  I will be recommending it to everyone I know who wants to learn more about the Islamic past. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had never heard of a book called "Censored: The Hidden History of Censorship in America" before I read it. I was pleasantly surprised at the good information contained in the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has great ideas about improving performance on tests and other challenging tasks.   I have noticed that I am much more aware of what I don't know than I am about what I do know.  I know what I need to learn and how to learn it, but I sometimes just don't want to do it.  The author discusses several ways in which people try to overcome this problem, and most of them are impractical.  However, the author concludes that in some cases learning isn't a matter of overcoming obstacles, but rather of recognizing them and learning from them.  This is what I think it takes to become a better programmer.
