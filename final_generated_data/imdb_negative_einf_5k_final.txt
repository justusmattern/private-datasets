Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a pretty good reason for it because if a person like myself was to break into a new country, I would want to know what was going on there, because I was pretty sure that after reading the back cover I would get some answers. To put it into words... I was curious to find out what was happening there, and to my pleasant surprise, this movie was really boring. As the movie went on and on with some nice things being said about the people who were involved with this movie, I was getting the same feeling from it. They're so stupid and dumb, and it's very bad. A good, well directed movie that can make a great movie out of it would be this. It was a really great movie and I'd really like to see it again, which I didn't have the chance to see because this is like their attempt to make it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to give this movie any 10 stars, even. I would have to see it for myself, the only thing I'm going to say is that it's been edited for TV (the DVD). And, I was pretty harsh about this in my comments on TV. As I am a member of the Hollywood Foreign Exchange Student Union, a student of film production and a film student at UC Davis, I don't really have a biased opinion on this movie as many people that have come into contact with it. And this movie has really, really bad acting, bad character development, bad music, bad script. This isn't the kind of movie that can be recommended to anyone. The DVD has the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is rated PG (I was told that it had the same rating as the PG-13 "C" rated comedy) and is supposedly about a 10 year old who is the youngest of the main characters in the film (about 10 years old). This film is based on the comic book, the first three of which were released in 1976 and are now being released on the web. "C-rated" versions of these books are also available.  If you are under 12, you are now able to see this film in a public school setting.  The reason it is being released in the summertime is due to the fact that the distributor was able to get permission from Disney to do so.  I would recommend that parents who are going to have a little kid of their own, that they spend the money that they are going out with to rent a "G-rated film."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few things in this movie: 1.) The film is available for DVD. So it is not available on VHS. 2.) It's available on DVD. There is also a little preview of the DVD. I don't know if I can download it. 3.) I like to download from the internet, so I can probably rent the movie. This is because the trailer was so bad that I was really tempted to buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself getting interested in a movie about the great history of the "Jungle" (I love historical movies).   This movie was the most boring thing I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this film at all. They went on a promotional tour and were very vague and didn't bother to clarify anything. A good example of that is in the film.  They were really trying to sell the movie as an action film. They wanted you to love and support this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have ever watched a horror movie, you have seen a horror story that was about a killer (for the majority of it), there are hundreds of killer's for you to hunt. Most of them are evil and most of them do evil things to people and animals, so I'm actually just gonna be brutally honest and tell you: this is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard of this movie being a 'true-life' film and was looking forward to seeing my favorite actor in a movie that could really reflect a true story. I am hoping that someone with a degree in the fine arts will read this review. I found this movie was just a bunch of actors playing characters in it's own script. This was a disappointing movie. The only good thing about this movie is the documentary. And since I was in the documentary mode I had to see it for what it was, which is really funny and interesting. If you saw the documentary you'll know what I mean by that film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always been fascinated by the concept of a story telling animal who has to make decisions and take the time out to make a decision, I'm curious to see how the movie treats the story telling instincts and the characters in their natural order (forgive me if this is a silly or unimportant movie). I don't even want to compare the movie to the original or The Secret Life of Animals as a reference for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the movie "B" for a lot of reasons. This film, unfortunately, suffers from the usual Hollywood formula. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought they would be very happy to have gotten the nomination, because they were just so happy about how good they were going to be the next year. This film didn't get a nomination for my recommendation because they couldn't agree to let me watch it. I am an expert at reviewing films and, in this case, I think the film is best viewed on DVD, and if they can get their heads around it will be good enough for me to review it there. I really don't think that you can really get too mad about this situation and, if you could, it would make the film that much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a lifelong fan of the book, and was one of the many critics of the movie. (I am not a movie snob and had already seen many movies in my lifetime).  This is the worst film ever made. I will never see another movie made by an actor. I hope this is not the last of the film. I don't even want to see him on the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you have no time to do something like the movie was supposed to be made, there's no way you're going to like the end result, even though this movie is meant to be about a love story, not to end it like a bad one!  The only thing that saved this movie from being a terrible movie was the cast. It's not that bad. I just didn't get the full story and I felt like I'd lost my innocence, so I went to sleep and came back feeling drained. I was a good teenager, I really believed in things, I still believe in life and that this story could've helped my view on life, so that's why I went see the movie, and I thought the ending would help me go back in time and see my friend and so I'm sorry I wasted my time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found out about this movie by accident.  This movie was made for a film festival (not really a documentary) and the festival was held in Vancouver, Canada. It was the festival that chose to screen this movie and was given the right by the festival's producer. This movie is about the lives of indigenous people on a reservation in Canada in the Canadian Rockies. It is not meant to be the first documentary on the lives and stories of the native peoples. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how much I need to say that this movie is a "documentary". What I do know is that this documentary tells the world's "story" but the people involved in this film are, in my opinion, amateurish. They make no attempt to show the "big picture" of this story, and no attempt at doing so. They are a bunch of people, just like those who are involved in the film, talking to a camera about it. No one has any idea what they're doing. If they'd been shown my friend's script for the film (which was done by a great British actor, and in which the big picture of this whole story was laid out before anyone in the room) they would have realized this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director, and the producer of this film, both want to bring a message of change to the world, and I believe that both of them are sincere and sincerely trying to accomplish that.but but they both do not have the financial ability to bring this movie to a stage or to produce it, and with a lot of people around the world in it, they're going to have to make some cuts and to pull it down to one of the big European films or to bring it to the U.S. They are currently on the verge of being unable to complete the film's theatrical run, and unfortunately, I can't offer any comment about that. The film is currently on a German DVD label, and they will be releasing the movie in the U..S. in late spring 2008, and it will be titled, "Maus am Schluss". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not against a guy going to fight because he should be in the gym. When I was at my local gym and they had to let me go to the boxing gym because the guy had to take care of a sick baby, so I do believe there are people who have the right mentality, for what the movie was about. But there are a lot of other people out there who seem to be just there for the paycheck, who do not understand the whole process of life and how hard it is. They seem to think they have it made, that all the stuff they do in life is glamorous and all they do is take their health for granted, that they are invincible. I do not think it is fair to let the movie reflect that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Forgive me for thinking that it was for my children, because I didn't actually expect a comedy to be in the same category as this. I watched this movie for two reasons. It was released on DVD, and I was told I'd get to see it on a pay per view basis and see how I rate it on IMDb, and it was also released as part of a series in Canada. I guess they figured I would get a chance to rent it, and rent I did. This was the first one in the series, so my impression was that there wasn't much of a Canadian market for this film. I did read somewhere that it would come out with more of a cast in the last one, but I hadn't seen that one either. And the only thing that might be a clue would be the fact that it had Canadian actors.   In this film, the only two non-Canadian actors in the whole film are the two supporting characters. The two supporting leads are the guys in the other two movies, and they are two of the best actors you'll ever have. I want to see them but they will do better in another film, so it would be rude of me to ask them to do the film for two bucks, so to speak.  The film is all about a woman named Mary Jane Watson, and her sister, Mary Elizabeth Watson. Mary Jane plays Mary Jane, and although she's only the second woman in the entire series to play the part of Mary Jane in this movie, I suppose that's enough of a woman for two girls to play Mary Jane. I'm hoping Mary Jane doesn't have a huge role. If she does, I will make it my mission to change that.  Now, if you do see the film, you can probably determine what the two female leads in this film are playing.  And if you get some small consolation, I'm sure that they're not playing the female leads of the other series. That's a bad thing, because by the time this movie comes out, I think there will be a total of 10 movies in this series, or close to that many hours of film. That means there's really no way to know who would have made a decision to play these two female characters.  Mary Jane has a bit of a role in this because she is played by a woman and is seen in a flashback, where she was seen leaving the house with her sister. In the flashbacks, the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most ridiculous part of this movie, by far, is the idea that it was going to be a horror flick. "Hate Me", by contrast, was a comedy about love and about two guys who found each other in the hotel lobby. It's like they found out that they were in love and thought, 'Oh yeah, we're going to make this movie about how they met and fell in love.' I can understand a movie where I have to endure this and this is so awful!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not making this movie for personal satisfaction; I would watch it just to find out what happens to these characters. I'm not convinced these actors really know what happens; there is too much going on and they all look like they are in one place; they all want to appear in their own little world and all of a sudden they all get involved in it and I just think it's too hard to get a feel for it; maybe they will be too busy and go home and come back a week later. It's kind of like The Matrix. (The Matrix)  This is all about one big city, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a guy who plays a bad guy, it's going to be a long night. The DVD version is only available at video stores.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself bored, I had to get up early in the morning to do a good amount of the film. I would suggest watching this movie with a group of friends in order to see how they would fare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first person to see the film was completely turned off by it. This movie was about 3 hours long. It was a poor attempt at a romantic comedy of any kind.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie is a true masterpiece; in fact it is a wonderful historical drama.   This movie is about an hour and forty minutes of my life. It is a "feel-good" movie.  It might just be my poor excuse for acting, but this movie is bad because it makes you sick; it makes me sick; and I'm a very, very sensitive guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are all too eager to make friends and forget about the past.  I did like to meet and be friends with the actors and hear what they had to say. As it is, the actors were the same ones from the first movie and were the "good cop/good cop" that I had met and befriended, so I think they just played a supporting role in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started out on the screen. It was for the most part a film about one person: my dad. After my family took over the budget, the movie got a little crazier and more "real" (though we can't say it was pretty). So I'm pretty sure that people who like the film or people who know my family from other things (like the TV show, for instance) would probably like this version more. Maybe. Because there was one scene that was made for this movie and one scene for the TV series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first three movies are funny, and are the most like the "Olympic Games", or similar to what they are like in London or Berlin, in which the US have won gold in at least one Olympics.  The "I" in the last three is a big step backwards, and should never have been made. The entire US team was invited to participate in the Olympics, and their best wishes were extended, the whole team deserved to win gold in the "I Olympic Games". I do believe the "American" team would have qualified in the games, if only for the fact that the US women's team was disqualified from the games. I was able to find some people from that team who were part of that final qualifying meet in the summer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For me, there's not really anything new about this. My recommendation for the movie is just "witness this movie."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In his book, the hero was a man with a lot of blood, guts and viscera, he was the "man with guts and bone" and was an "expert" (although, a man in general) who would do "everything".   There are a bunch of people who would go "what if?" I was one of them, I went to the movie's Wikipedia page, which describes the story in the book (although that was before I read the book) and I found that it says the book is more accurate. It is true that the movie starts on a train, in Paris, and that is where the train is from. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To begin, I do think it is possible to give some credibility to this movie and I am curious to find out what the director thinks, and I was very curious about this. I am just so upset about all of the things that they have put into this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A remake of the "Pale Rider" movie "Dance of the Dinosaurs", this is the same Dinosaur movie, albeit with different actors. The dinosaur itself looks very similar to the "Dinosaur" and has similar hair color, in color and size. I don't know if that was intentional on the part of the creators. I had to watch this "PALE" version to determine the new movie's dinosaurs, since the original Dinosaurs were green (as seen in the trailer). There is another dinosaur that looks pretty similar to "DINOSAUR" and is green, though, in the original "PALEO" movie, so "PALK" should have made that one appear very green, but I can't say for sure which dinosaur this is. I didn't even think of any Dinosaurs that look good looking, as they all look like they are in a T-shirt or something. There are three other dinosaur movies that have only one or two (depending on what is on the shelves at the moment) dinosaurs that are similar to them, so this is not the only dinosaur movie that looks like it was made with the help of a 3-D printer.   It's bad-bad. This movie is about a dinosaur named Palico. It looks as though it's going to be a pale guy, which is pretty weird and completely ridiculous. What I found is even worse. The movie was not bad as a "Palk", which was in the early days of "PALS" and I had seen it many, many times, where a movie about an actual dinosaur is shown, which has the power to scare you away with some scary acting, since that's supposed to be something that can bring people to a new age (or something). This movie's "pale" dinosaur doesn't scare anyone, and this is another reason why this movie wasn't good enough to be called a "DINO" flick. It's not meant to be scary.  This movie could scare you with the "piloting" scene, which was a pretty awesome scene with some really great "pals" flying around a dinosaur and such, as it was very silly for some reason (and it could be worse, since there are really few scenes in this movie, being only a couple of shots) I found out why it didn't work on the "Flying" scene and the scene in the middle of the road with the dinosaur, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The film is based on my own life" (so I should not have written about it)  Although the film was written about my own story it was all but written for that. At the time of the production, and certainly as of the time I have watched it, it had been decided that, as the director, that my best friend would be the one to star in the movie, and so I have been working for a couple of years now to find an actor who would play my best-friend in the film. The actor was very good but we are talking about a film set in 1950s and, in the meantime, the film had already taken place in the '30s. I believe it would be very appropriate to make the film into a '1930s production. There have been a couple episodes made into "re-enactments" of events that had taken place between those '30's events, and it was done in that form, but I wanted to make sure that my friends and family could see the whole movie. That was the reason I asked for the '1940' rating, or '1939' at the time that I was in the production of "Mystery Science Theater 3000."  I am very interested to see how the film turns out, if it does, and we all have hope for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film at the Toronto International Film Festival on the "Filmfest" section of the festival. I was really hoping that it would make it's way into Toronto, or at least some of the other films being presented at that festival, or would have a few people at the festival present to see it. I saw the film on the IMAX big screen, and it's just too big and so I'm going to guess that IMAX screens are still a couple of screens down the road.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first film, but then I think my movie "Stuart Saves the World" got made after this film, and I had no idea what I was getting into! I'm so glad I went to this movie, but I'd be so thankful if the film wasn't as "bad" for other people to see, as it was so that people would know the real story behind the film and not just something made up of what is in this film (the only "bad thing" that wasn't bad is the "Stu").

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's really bad that i mean bad because it's bad that people see it, but people see something they think it is, and you see a horrible movie, terrible story, terrible actors, and horrible music. I give this movie three stars because it is a terrible film, terrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know this is the only film in existence, and that's why I'm writing this review, that's how I'm feeling about this film. I am just thankful I have the strength to stay home to watch it. I was going to watch this in person. The "treat yourself" DVD release was so disgusting. It's a bad horror movie. If you don't believe me, it's only because I am not in my proper form. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the things that attracted me to the film was that it was a low budget movie. In a low-budget movie, the guy who directed this movie is not a "professional". I do not believe that the acting was good either for the girl or the guy. The girl was in a bikini and the guy was in his underwear in most scenes. She didn't act like a beautiful girl and she acted like a girl.  The man was cute and beautiful and he didn't dress like a "pretty girl". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is about the hero's journey and the hero gets lost in the middle. When he goes to his hotel he gets into another story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite movie of the 90's is the cartoon, not the film, because I loved the cartoon and I think the cartoon will never disappear and will be available on DVD, so I do want to see the movie and see if it can be released on DVD.  As As was the case with the original cartoon, there is a song about Asie, who I would be very surprised to see not do an interview with in the media because there is no one who thinks the cartoon should just disappear. I think it is important to keep in mind that Asie is not a very sweet person and I was hoping for the movie to show a loving ending for Asie (it would seem that there is not going to be a movie with Asie as the main character anymore). I think Asie's character is a lot weaker and the character of Asie and her mother have been changed from the cartoon. It's very disturbing, especially in the first half of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like this movie, I don and I hope you don't get a chance to watch it. This movie looks as good as it is in the back of the movie book.   The plot is okay, the movie looks like it is about a really good, exciting movie (with the same great performances by Michael Ironside and Tom Skerritt and the same terrific music score). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I don't know if it was one of the other reviewers, so I don´t know what it was, but let´s see what I have to work with, or I´m afraid to make a movie again. I can recommend you to watch this movie to anyone who does not like violence or shock or shock value. But I personally am afraid that this movie will cause a lot of damage to the viewer. There´s nothing really worse than seeing a terrible movie, so please, watch it in the dark, don´s trust me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My friends and I are about to watch a movie, and my gut feeling tells me that this movie is probably for kids.   What really got me worked on this movie was to get some actors who could do really dark voices, like I did with "The Sixth Sense" movie and with the movie "Ghosts" and the two horror movies starring Nicolas Cage. I did want to be able to see more of the dark side of the mind. I was able to get a couple of lines from Tom Skerritt in "The Incredible Mr. Ripley" film, and that's a good actor. I don't want to see the rest of the cast do what I just saw them do on "Mystery Men", because they're great actors but it would be an interesting change to see them doing a psychological horror movie in the 70's like "The Omen". The movie is pretty much just what it is - the first movie was an experimental psychological study of the subconscious, the second was a movie about the subconscious and the third was a film about the mind's subconscious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't fathom how anyone could possibly have thought this was the greatest film ever made.  The only reason I found this film interesting was because of the acting by the actors, not because it was funny. It was absolutely pathetic and completely predictable, and I was thoroughly bored. It wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it didn't deserve even the most casual comment, and, worse, it was so bad I found myself having to rewind the film twice to be able to watch it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was actually the funniest movie of the year, and I'd give this movie an Oscar, for the movie is an odd, bizarre, low-budget, amateurish, film, and should be in the category of the best of the summer blockbuster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is based on the book of the same name which has been published by Knopf and is titled "Fugitive" by Knope. The book is titled, "The Fugitive of Red River." This is not a movie, a documentary, and I'd have to rent it from the big box store chain. I'd hate to think I'm responsible for having to watch one of the stars in a movie that I know nothing about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the movie first, on TV, and liked it very much. This isbut one little film on MTV, made during my high school years, and I found it quite boring, cheesy, and predictable. What was there to like about the movie? It's one movie about four people.  I'm not a big movie fanatic, and like to see movies I don't have to wait long. If I were a 14 year old girl, I'd probably watch this movie alone, or rent it. If you have any interest in movies, read this review. I would recommend skipping this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this film is the story of the love of two strangers--how about that? I was expecting the "WOW!" movie--that's like going to see a Broadway show, for instance, "Oh, this is a real love" or "This is a good love" show. I have come to watch this film at The Tribeca Film Festival, in New York City. And it's just a bad love story. The director is not even good as the story teller. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just a movie about two of the most famous guys, one of whom is dying, so let's talk about the guy who's dying. His wife, who died when he was 18 years old, and her sister, who are still alive, and the mother of his two children, as well as his two other children and sister-in-law. I've always tried to understand how anyone could watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are quite good reasons to see this movie as "the second season of Lost"--in that I think it would make sense to see that show's main cast of actors, some of whom had been involved in the series in some capacity, and I have seen them do a bit of work in other "Lost" movies. In this film, only two of the main characters are played by main cast actors, and these two are the two main characters (Ned and Locke) and are the only two who appear in this film. The others appear in the "Lost 3" series. I find it extremely unlikely that this movie is going to be made into an actual "lost series", because of the lack of quality that is going through this movie. There are several reasons why: First, it's a comedy--it's just the way it's made.  Second, it seems to be the story of a guy's love interest--it could have just been one person. Third, I found it very, very difficult to relate to the main cast.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must admit that I saw this movie with a bunch of friends, because I went to see some of the friends, and when we saw the movie on the video, it seems to be the first time it's on video, and so I have a lot of respect for the director, because he is not a great film director. I mean, he's still a good writer and he should try his hand at a movie of a film of the time and the time period of the 20th century. I'm sure he'll do that. It was his most recent film, "Troy" in the same time period, with that kind of story line. He has done well with the "Gone in 60 Seconds" movie with another friend of mine, "Godsend", and in "The Truman Show", and other movies of the same genre.  This movie was, at the very least, filmed in the 1970's, and the characters were pretty much just as I would have been living at the time. I guess some of you are going to get mad, saying "this movie was made 30 years ago", and maybe you're going to watch the movie "Mystery Men", and you'll get mad at them for not doing the same thing, because the characterizations were pretty bad, as if they had been done by someone else. And the acting was horrible.  I'll admit that some of my friends in the movie were "Mysterious Men" and I don't remember much about them, so I can't really speak of their acting, and I can understand how it would have had a very big impact on the plot because that story line was probably very important for the movie. I don. This is one of the reasons why people were so happy with the way the "Mystics" were portrayed in the first film, which was in the 1940's, when they were still in a time of fear and confusion. I didn't even want to rent this movie because I was afraid of watching another one, and was worried that I was going to laugh hysterically at all the characters. It seems that the movie had been written by someone who really didn't understand how to write and present characters in a movie that would actually make them interesting.  The only reason that I gave this movie an 8.7 is because it was in "Dramatics", which is supposed to be a very simple kind of film that was really not serious at all,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to some movie that had some sort of connection to this movie. This is the only movie of its kind on DVD and so it should have some sort importance in terms of the knowledge gained by my future self in this type of movie. My only positive review in regards to this was that it was on an older format. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been over 15 years since this film was made, and there are still lots of people still in the same places.   The movie starts off with an interview with the director of the film, who is the "original" actor.  That's the first scene of the movie, and it's very funny, and I've done a number of interviews and interviews with the late Frank Sinatra, who was interviewed in that movie.  It was a totally different movie, with Sinatra in his "singing heyday," as if he had never left New York.  Sinatra was born in Chicago, lived in New York, and died in California, so it's not as though Sinatra made the movie in the old town of New York where he was so prominent in the '30's and '40's, he lived there.  In the old movie, the movie shows Sinatra as he appears on stage singing his own version of Sinatra songs. That's Sinatra's song "Fly Me to the Moon," and it was also very popular with the public during the 1930's and 1940's, when he was singing it on the stage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A number of times, the director of the movie has said, or even implied that the two leads should get along and become friends. This is not only a bad film but also a very stupid film with poor acting and some very strange situations. The story of the whole movie is that of a woman who's husband is getting remarried and the husband in the next scene (at the end of the film) says to the mother who gives birth to the child (he is called by the name of "the mother") that he wants a family of four. The child is just about to be born. It goes on and on, you can't just make some "fairy tale" about how the wife is in some remote part of the countryside (with a baby in her belly). If the father sees the child, he'll find out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why I decided to watch this movie, it was a Saturday night. It was also a very late show, the movie started at 11:50 or something like that. Also, as you probably know, it doesn't have subtitles, so in case anyone had any problem understanding this movie (or even worse, had any difficulty making the whole film), there's really no other reason I can think of to do this movie. It's worse than a bad remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the other actors in this movie (particularly the one that portrayed the lead); they had taken on the roles of the villain, the "villain" in "Batman Begins."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this movie in 1976, it was about a man with a typewriter. I believe it was called a "man with an old typewriter" or "man of old typewriters" or whatever.  The second time I rented it I found out I had to get a "Man With a computer" from Blockbuster. This was really hard to find. Maybe Blockbuster or Amazon has them on the shelves or something, or it was released on TV by someone. It was released in the summer of 1998, which means it was made in the early '90's, or maybe it was rereleased. Whatever the case, this movie was released with it's "original" run of "Man with a computer".  This was about my favorite film, "Return of the King" which is still available. This is the original run of the film with the original script and the original production number. There were no commercials. There was no special features, not even a trailer.  I think it is time to give the people what they have come to expect, and if that is in a DVD release, just about the original, since there are really no new features.  It is a shame for the DVD release to try and make it seem like it was a big hit, it is a major disappointment, IMHO, to have something so awful and terrible, that you don't want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many reasons not to do this. First off, how will the movie be made on the big screen? The first film was filmed on the stage at the University of Virginia where the University is located. It is in a beautiful area where there was not a lot of traffic. This one is filmed on a stage in the middle of town in a city that is about an hour away from the University (the actual location is just a few blocks away), which means that if you see this movie on a big screen you are going to be stuck watching it.   The only reason I'm giving this movie for the first film is that it was a student film with only a handful of people actually doing the film, so let me give you the big one:  There's also the idea that this film will be out later in the fall. The production company was also making an adaptation of "Gone With the Wind" on which I was doing my "Dress to Kill" film on.  Second, they are all pretty darn good actors, from Burt Reynolds and Joan Crawford to Warren Beatty and Burt Munroe, who were making a film called "Gringo Dynamite" at the time. There are also good directors who did such movies as "Alligator Alley," "A Time to Kill," "The Black Cat" and "Gentle Giant," and there is great music from such artists as "Tommy" Jobe, "Babe," "Rita," and "Toto" (and I'm not alone in thinking the same).  Third, they're all fairly young, so there is a chance they will all have some sort of career in the film industry that will make it more feasible to make this film a true reflection of what's going on at the moment. Fourth, I don't think it will be hard to find people to do the "G" in town, so you will have a good number of them. I just want to stress that they are a bunch of people who just happen to be in town. In addition, there are some very good actors that will have some work, and I'm hopeful the film will get the chance to be released on DVD.  Fifth, I am still an independent filmmaker, so I have been working on this for some time. I do my best to make work that is accessible to the "average person." If you really need to see "Gonzo" you can

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's pretty obvious that the actors are really struggling in this movie. I mean, the movie is not that terrible, it is not something that could make people watch a movie, and the characters are pretty decent enough. I think the main character is a pretty interesting one, and it would be great to see a film from somebody who is just making this film. Maybe this is a guy or girl making a movie from the perspective of somebody who loves the character (a man or woman). The movie was made in 1980, and I would love to see some other character of his or her doing something that wasn't so serious.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this movie it was at the theatre in Toronto, and then I didn't really remember it at all because I didn it at the time.  Anyway, my wife and I decided to go to the theatre and see if we could get the film to come out. We were fortunate enough to be one of the first to see this movie, and in that theatre we did buy a copy of this movie on DVD, which is one of those that came out before it came out on VHS. The DVD actually came out way later than this movie did, and so the VHS had the first film, but we had no reason to buy the VCR-like VHS version of this, so the first thing we did was rent the VCD-based version, which we did to see the first 20 minutes of it. That's the one that came with the film, and we didn't care much for it because it wasn't about a very good film, which was basically the movie about "The Naked Gun." There are some very good people in that part of the movie, which I'm sure would be a lot better than the part I saw. And that's another of those great films that can be found in "The Untouchables" which is not to be found here. If you get the DVD or if you get a VCD version, you'll find it.  And the part of it I saw in the VDVD that was from the part that's actually about the nude swimming was not very good, and the nude scene with Amanda in that scene was just as I'd imagined, because it's completely different from the one in the film. The first nude scene comes off a bit flat and not sexy, but that doesn't come off in this scene, and it seems to be about a year old by now, because I guess that's when it was made. The whole scene from the beginning of the swimming scene up until the moment we see Amanda in the shower is completely different. So we thought this would make a lot of sense, because if the film was the movie that came after the first one, you know there'd be some similarities, and they'd be quite good. It would be the scene where Amanda gets naked with the guy in the hotel room that is from the very beginning.  So in that very first scene they are naked, and that's about the only time that's completely new. I don't know what

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the novel (with the exception of the last few chapters) about a year ago, and I enjoyed that book. The author is a very talented writer. I don't know how this film will do in regards to a certain character that they have developed. If you like the book, go read it. If it's a very old movie, I would say that it's the first or the second one (or some other similar movie). It is really hard to believe that the director has come out on the big screen with a "new" script, at least in part because the movie seems to be like a very "perfect" script in parts. I'm really not sure what all that is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made at a cost of $5 million to the producers of the original "Star Wars" movie, "The Empire Strikes Back". As many people know, the last Star Wars movie cost only $5.00 million.  "Empire" is based on the Lucasfilm Story Group, however, and these guys are trying to recreate that movie with the exact same set, props, and character that they had in the pre-release and have no experience whatsoever with making a Star Wars film and I am going to give this movie a score of 1/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has been well covered in the press since the late '80's and '90's with the "Bobby Ray" case and "Kathy" case, and since then. The reason it's being covered again now is that the case has finally settled and been released from the National Archives. I would expect that the "Kathleen" case will get released in the next 15 years, if not sooner. There's only one picture and only one case being released right now, which is the "Ray" case. It's not released for privacy reasons, and I don't think that they even realize how much it's important to the "Case File" that I have to release it here and now. The other two cases are locked in some vault, where they never left the "offical" files. I don´t want to have to deal with them again. I will be releasing that case on DVD, in my own "Private Collection", on the DVD box. They were very well handled on the case back in the day and I thought there were no problems with them, but I know now that it is a big, high quality picture.butbutbutBUTbutbutyet the "Private Case" has nothing of it and is still on the back cover, and it will be released in a private collection soon. The two other "Private cases" are very much different and will never be shown again. The only case of the three that I am aware of is available now was the one that was used in the film "Crisis of Character", in which I didn't use any of it in the "Film". There are still people who have "lost" it. They didn't have the best of memories of "The Case File", and their lives were too important to not release the whole case. I have no idea who was responsible for that mistake, but we will be working on a fix.  And of course, those who have that "Private" case are very interested in the contents of the "Official" case to see if their memory is correct. So I am not trying to release a "Private", very embarrassing case of a horrible situation. I feel really sorry for the two young people who were involved and have to endure this and their families are suffering for the past 20 years for nothing. It truly has been a nightmare and I am only just scratching the surface of the misery of this situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can buy a copy of this, it would have cost me $7. I can't think of a reason why this movie was made for the money to be made. It would cost at least $100. So if you want to see a real movie about a real story, go rent a real one. I would like to see some real courage, not a bunch of "real" people on screen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens in a small town of about 100 people. It continues to progress outward, to the point where I am unsure of where the film ended (the towns of towns in the Netherlands?) The town of Maastricht is an example of an industrial town, and a good one. The rest of the film takes place in a rural area (a little more populated), which includes an entire town or region of 30,000-something people, all in the middle of the country, on the other side of the Netherlands, with a small bridge that separates it from the Netherlands. A short drive from the border to the Netherlands would put one on the border of Germany or Belgium.    That is the nature of the movie. The reason for the film making is not so much to explore and create a unique rural environment, but rather to produce an honest, accurate but flawed portrait of a town, of which a local expert told me that the best part is the town hall, and in which there is a wonderful community spirit.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbuttbutbutthough the town wasbutbutalthough verybutbutbecause IbutbutbeenandbutbutButbutbutandbutBUTBUTbutBUTyetthebutbutthebutbecausebutbutitbutbutenoughbutbuttobutbutexceptbutbutsoandbutyettobebuildandbutButBUTbutyetsobadly, and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a "real" family, with a father, son, daughter and other family members who are all in their 20s.  I really have no idea how any of these men survived the ordeal. I would advise anyone interested in finding out what happened to these men to see the movie and not just take my word on this film. This film is like an "I know it was for a reason, it could be in the movies and I'll never judge them." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of years ago I saw this movie at my local Blockbuster store in Denver, and it was pretty good. The people in this film were very nice, and I do think they're older than me, just like most of the cast members were in the TV show. They're pretty good actors, who know a little bit about how the world is like a big, and who know their lines. It's just that the character's name is spelled "Baldrick." So when I was in Denver (a few years ago) I saw Baldrick in the episode, "OZ", and I had seen a few years earlier the episode with the old man, "Doom", he was bald, so I had to look up the guy's name and see he's a balding old man!  This was a good explanation as to why the character was bald. He was pretty much a little boy at the time of the movie, and the producers decided to make him bald.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do not know the director's name and the casting directors and I have seen only one scene which is what I saw in the TV show and that was in it's final four seconds of the show before it aired. If anyone of the actors would like to talk about the TV version, I will be glad to hear them out. The one thing that I can say for sure, that when the TV series ran it had a different name. If the TV was the same show that ran in it 'The Wonder Years', it's likely that they would be talking about it as "Wonder Years". The Wonder Years were on TV at one point when I was a kid. I watched it for four months.  If you do not remember it, the show ran for one year, while The Wonder Year ran for two years. It was a show that was canceled a few years back so that it could go back to the studio and make a movie. This is a movie that ran from 1994 to 1996.  I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that there are a lot of people who have never heard of this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say I liked it in the beginning, it was kind of a low-budget horror, but I didn't think there were enough people around to get a screening on video.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was directed in 1998 and was about the future of the US military. We had the pleasure of seeing the first "Trench" movie, which was about WW1. I was a young GI during WW1, and I was in the same company, and our GI instructors were on the same hill.  If you have never seen that first movie, it is not terribly complicated, I can tell you it would still be hard to get into and understand, it was filmed in black and white.  It would be interesting to see the film from the other end of the spectrum, as I would like to point out that the military is not the only institution to be affected by PTSD. It was written by a man who was "all-American", it is impossible for the film to make any sense from the perspective of any "hero". In the first movie we were treated to a character, a man, whose father was a hero, who was wounded in battle. He was told, not for the first time, that his brother was killed in the first film. In this movie, the man's father is the one that should be telling him that his son is dead.   He is not a "hero", his character is weak and unsympathetic. If you want to say that it was a man's movie, go watch "The Great Zu".

They're all around me, although the movie is about the people who are trying to run the races on the track, or who are in the movie trying to "live it up" with the winner, that is why it's so painful. You can't imagine how horrible it was. The last thing I want to mention about the movie was the other day when I watched it, and I had to do something with the end credit because the ending was so awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen all the great movies in the world, and it's interesting to see the trends. It seems that people seem to get older. As the years go by, they seem to become more jaded. This movie was pretty good. I enjoyed seeing the great lines of the old movie, and the one-liners.  When it came to writing the movie, I found myself in a real quandary, which is that all my characters are the same age, age of about 40. This is because I had a lot of people in the audience who were in their 40s, which are really old, so the lines in the movie were all really, really long. I mean, it really was just a matter of trying to write them with some kind of flow or some kind, like a short one-sheet comedy. My apologies to all the guys in there who are getting old and really old guys trying to do this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the movie, I have to say I was pretty optimistic that after this, I would be going to the movie theater with a big stack of change (in fact I would think this film would be a very well-made film).  This is a poorly made film (the film was about to be done with about 10 minutes). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read reviews about this and I thought I would be able to enjoy something new. I guess I was wrong because I really didn't understand the movie (and that's because I read the script twice - the first time and the second time). So the first thing to say is that this movie was meant to be about the history of the country so you'd assume that everything would be a bit more accurate than what was being portrayed in the movie.  The first two movies were about the life of King George III (a man that really knew about and knew that the French were fighting for the King and in the first two French films King George IV knew that all he had to do was sit in the court of King Louis XVIII and that's what I really liked to learn about) so I find it interesting to learn that this was just a war of the past century and that the King had to fight for his life in this movie. Well, he fought for himself in the battle of Waterloo and died and that makes no sense at all... The second thing was that Louis XVII didn't really look or act like a king or even like a modern day King! His hair was short (a bit like the King) and he looked like a dashing guy and he wasn't very handsome (although he was handsome in person), like King Louis did. And it seems to me that the only person that looks more handsome than King Louis is his son Louis XV. (he was the son of King Charles VII)  The third thing was his clothes, he looked the exact same as the King of France, even the trousers and shoes were made by Louis XV with no alterations at all and that was quite strange.  Then, finally, he didn't sound like a King either... This was something that was supposed to be the French characterisation of a very intelligent person (but apparently it wasn't translated to English and I found that quite funny) and that may have been because of the English actors (they didn't know what he was saying at the time, and the King was talking to some of the French actors) and the French ones didn't speak English either.  There is a scene that has Louis XV reading some letters from King Louis, and it is true that the letters were written in French, and Louis XV did look exactly like the king. If you really looked closely at the two men you could see it.  King Louis was still King Louis so that there was one
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the most expensive, expensive film ever made. Some have said it would be great for a family to see it. This is the least of the "Pleasantville" movies that we had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read a few reviews and most of the reviews here were saying, "This movie is a comedy, a comedy from Jim Carrey, a guy from "Saturday Night Live"". They're not the only person that thinks that way. I am in a very small town with some neighbors that think that it is a funny film and I'm not one of them. They think that they're really funny and they are supposed to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's about 3 hours long movie, with my girlfriend and me sitting side by side in a theatre. It's the only movie ever made about it and I can't imagine how awful it is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has been reported that the producers are going to make a good movie of mine, I would urge caution to all those who are serious about watching this movie, this movie is one long, and I think most people could understand that it was made for TV. In the meantime, it seems that the movie was only meant to be an 11-episode TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a comedy, and that's what it's about. I really hate all the horrible, awful scenes that the original movie had. This is just one of those crappy movies that is, at best, 90 minutes long. My wife and I had to sit through it and laugh our way through it, and it was a bad comedy all the way through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen some really weird movies, most of them are pretty bad. It does have some good comments on it, and some of the actors are saying how this is the true story of a gay family member, and that they have a family reunion on the way. I hope that is the case, and I hope I can get a glimpse of this as it comes out, I can't say anything about it. It's really horrible and I give this movie a rating of 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a whole, this is a terrible movie with bad acting and bad acting.  I recommend people to watch the documentary first and to then watch this, and then come to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this movie, ever, so I've been given the opportunity to watch it. I was under the impression that they had done a screening in Hollywood, or in Toronto, or New York, or wherever there might have been a screening of this movie in the United States. And this is the only film that I've seen that is being shown to the public, so the public is watching it on the news or on television in Toronto.  We don't know anything about the plot or who is the bad guy or the good guy. There is no ending for this movie. The ending is simply awful. It's painful and horrible, to say the least. I wouldn't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was actually funny (how many guys are around who can relate) that I had seen this movie on the cover of Time Magazine, as a teenager who had just recently moved from Japan to the USA. It was a really funny movie. Maybe it could be my generation's generation's comedy (not the 80's version of the film). I was one of the original "jokesters" in high school. And it's really funny to watch how guys (and there are guys around) from different countries try to imitate our English jokes.  It's just a little "clever" I guess it was to try to get the Japanese guys' attention. There's more of a Japanese humor scene that plays out when Japanese men and women try to act in the film. The humor scene in the 80 film really shines when the guys are trying to act American, then there's no scene that actually has anything to do with the Japanese culture. That's what made me laugh the most in the movie, because the Japanese jokes are really funny, but this time, not every line is completely accurate, or the Japanese guy is portrayed correctly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the great things about cinema was the ability to switch between genres. I watched this in the hopes that it would be a comedy. My God is this movie terrible, it is bad, it really is bad. In fact, it just sucks. I am not gonna give you a recommendation for this movie, you can just enjoy the hell out of this movie for what it was originally. I do recommend seeing this for the last 30 minutes or so because it is a very small film (and you get to experience what I mean), because there were some pretty good scenes that really made the end of the film worth seeing. I would give it the same quality as I gave this film last year.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was like a "Kiss Kiss" movie where they showed kissing and then they kissed. I found the movie to be very predictable. They showed two guys (and then one guy) and then three guys. There was no development, very bad performance, very "low budget" look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why this movie is rated higher than it is. It is probably about time the director came to terms with the fact that he had done a movie that could be a horror. I think this is a movie about an hour long documentary. And I am no horror buff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My boyfriend and I went and saw the movie and he said to me, "Don't ruin it for the next guy." I was like, what?? What we got was the best of the best but it was still crappy by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a sequel to THE MOVIE THAT WAS RELEASED ON VHS in 1993. I'm sorry. As it has a sequel, and the same director as before, it's an American remake, so I'm gonna go ahead and rate it as a remake of THE MOVIET WITH KIDS.  (That's right, a remake, not the original, with the same actors in the exact same roles and with the exact identical dialogue, because it is the same movie with the only difference being the name.) The movie goes on to feature the same kids. It also features a bunch of kids who are obviously not really young (they're about 5 or 6 years old) and are in the same age range as the kids in the original movie, and it goes out to feature a bunch more kids and a bunch younger kids.  That makes it even more strange to watch, because the "twinkie-twinkies" are just the same people as the original kids, and those kids are now in their late teens or early 20's. Why would the kids go out with this "twin brother" who looks exactly like the kid who went on to become famous in the 'Twinkie Twinkie' movies? What the heck is the deal with this? I guess I didn't watch it very closely, or I didn of course like that kid. I find the kid to be absolutely ridiculous, and I am very disappointed in the quality of this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is actually quite funny. It's got a couple of "humor" jokes from the "Humor Movie" genre. So I think the humor and satire of this movie is mostly based around an effort to make fun of the American humoristic sense of humor (and I have to admit it's very funny in a couple clips). One example of this is when the guys in the "Hulk" movies and "The Big Chill" are goofing around and say "hahaha" and "buddy system" in the very first moments of their movies. That's a very silly and obviously "humorous" joke to be sure. Another example is when they're hanging upside down from their heads and talking about "Hollywood". Another example would be the "Buddhist monks" who come out of a big box of fake teeth in the beginning of the movie. I just wanted to make a few of these guys really "stupid". In this, we get a lot of dumb, stupid "humour" jokes. And I don't really understand the intent of this. This movie was made for "Humour" and fun. I don?t think that a large portion of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the best Hollywood films of all times. "Dance with Me". "I, Robot". I am also a big fan of the "I" franchise and would never want to ruin the reputation of the series with this terrible excuse for an epic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish this movie hadn't been released so I could give it some more publicity. It was really terrible and I just wanted to see a couple of scenes from it. I was so sick of it.  I'm actually going to be sick before the end of the film and I've had a terrible stomach for the last few days, I don't know if it was the movie itself or the movie in general. I mean I guess it could have made for a "light" comedy, the ending is terrible and there is so little time left.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie wasn't bad because of bad acting. It was bad because it was really, really dumb. I wasn't trying to watch an episode of some reality show. I'm a self-educated person, I love to learn about history and have read my history books and I don't want to watch a history-based movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must say, in the last two years I watched an almost 50 minute film. Now I watched this short film on a Friday afternoon on CBS television. The TV show "NYPD Blue" is about 4 hours and 47 minutes long. And it doesn't begin until Monday morning, so I think the show "Blue" is the superior of the two shows, but I had to write this review on a Monday morning. I think it would have been interesting to talk about how this film changed as it progressed from "Blue". If you've watched "Blue", you know that it is a little on the "tough guy" side, and it's more "soft" police work than the "Blue style". If this film was "Blue Blue", I would love to talk a little bit about that. It would have made an interesting review.   In this short, you get a real feel for the "butterbutter" ofbutbutbutBUTbutbut butbutbut(I can't say "butbutthebutbutbecauseI don't have the stomach to think about butbutBUTBUTbut"). And it goes on to be sobutbut BUTbutbut because of the fact that I didn't have to watch it the way "BlueBlue" was filmed, and I was able to keep my sanity and be on the same wavelength with this film, which was to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat but never to lose interest.butbutButbutbutyetbutbutwhich, I'm afraid,butbutwas not to the level.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the only movie in town at the time of release. There's an actual video store in town that had a rental on it, if they had really wanted to rent this, there's an even chance they might have gotten a few extra bucks. This movie is like a video for a reason, not only did they get the rights to a DVD release of this, they also get a crappy copy on an "anamorphic" format (they can change this and they are in the process of doing so).

The director didn't know the movie and he didn't even know what to make of it. In this movie the director of it, is the movie is about a man's life. He should be in a totally different movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with the usual "Citizen Kane" theme, which is really not a great way of starting a movie. I found it very confusing, to say the least. The direction was all over the place. I had the movie open on my computer, and I don't know if that's the kind of "shock" movie I was looking for. And if that was the first time I saw it, I couldn't say for sure whether the director had the film under control, not to mention, what the ending would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe I gave this film to anyone. You can do yourself a disservice watching the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read a number of negative reviews on this movie, so it's not like I'm looking to lose my money. I'm not looking for my life back. I know that after the movie I will be sad, and I have lost my life savings, I'm really looking for a movie that has a real life impact. A really depressing one is really what I want to watch. I wish I had some way to get a movie from the producers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie I really thought I could relate to about the inner struggle of a struggling person... this is a movie that tries to have a more interesting story, and one that actually touches a real person... I mean, I've seen some movies that were supposed to be "comedies" that touched my heart and had characters that I related to... i think that's because I actually related to them in real life... This butchered everything in it... I don't understand how someone can say that I "gave my heart" to it, or that it is a "movie that is supposed to entertain." It was a "tried and true" movie that tried to reach the masses with this movie. The film is so badly shot, it doesn't even make it to the stage, and there is really nothing to do with the film.  This movie is like a poor man's version of a poor Italian movie (or a movie made by an Italian with English subtitles). It's really terrible, and I'm amazed at how people still like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a documentary about the life of "Johann Christian Friedrich", an Austrian composer (born c. 1801), the great son of the composer's sister, whom he married in 1840 and bore five children.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and development of this movie is completely and utterly non-referential to anyone involved. The director of the film "directed" the movie as if he were writing a play or was making a film.  It's just a completely stupid movie, with the biggest ripoff of all time of a "Hooker" (a.k.a. "Honey Boo Boo") commercial. I think that it is worth watching a stupid movie only to watch it over and over again because this is a really stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was filmed in the spring of 1981, just after the "War Games" disaster, a year-long disaster where the Air Force simulated a nuclear attack on its own troops. In it, the Navy's "Treaty of Friendship" (aka "Peace Through Strength" or "T-5") is portrayed in the same light as the Airforce's "Peace through strength" or the AirForce's "The Deadly Game" (which was not the same as a simulated nuclear attack), and some of the actors were the same, who played in "The Dangerous Game", the most famous of the nuclear games. The movie version has two Air Force Commanders, "Naval Commander David A. Lovejoy" and "Air Force General Barry McKeon".  Air Force Generals McKeone and Lovejoy were in the Air Warfare School in 1968-69, and they were then "reared to be nuclear leaders", and that, in my opinion, made them more qualified to be portrayed in this version, because they knew about the dangers of nuclear attack, were able to describe those dangers (although they were just a few years older than their fictional counterparts), and were able tell their stories about nuclear weapons and the horrific consequences of nuclear weapons in a way that could not be morebutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbuttbutbutthough.butbutalthoughbutbutandbutbutButbutbutbecausebutbutenoughbutbutuntilbutbutbuttonbutbutagainbutbutexceptbutbutunlessbutbutbeenbutbutprimbutbutdespitebutbutperhapsbutbutthanbutbutbeforebutbutthenbutbutratherbutbutstillbutbutwhilebutbutpossiblybutbuttheybutbutwhichbutbutnotbutbutinsteadbutbutsobutbutalbeitbutbutmaybebutbutamongbutbut BUTbutbutduebutbutpleasebutbutevenbutbutthusbutbutmeaningbutbutbasbutbutsincebutbutthankbutbutespeciallybutbutbarebutbutbothbutbutthatbutbutwithoutbutbutalsobutbutwhenbutbutprobablybutbutalongbutbutaccordingbutbutwhybutbutshebutbuttoobutbutwhobutbutneverbutbutincludingbutbutdependingbutbutyeahbutbutnoticebutbutnorbutbutfarbutbutnormbutbutthanksbutbuteitherbutbuttherebutbutbetterbutbutwithbutbutyoubutbutthesebutbutbonbutbutbetbutbutanythingbutbutbeesbutbuttheirbutbutnothingbutbutmustbutbutparts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the writer should be commended for not basing this on some religious premise. If the film was truly about faith, it would have been a great movie in terms of what I consider a religious film: the "Tropic of Capricorn" and the "Babel" for example.  I've been involved in some Christian-oriented movies in my time, and the message is the same: a world that is based on an eternal truth.but unfortunately the movie is about how a couple of angels come to earth, with one angel dying, and then we are introduced to the idea of heaven, while the angels (who have an angel as a wife) go to a hospital on earth and we're left to assume they're all dead. I'm sorry to say I'm still a Christian, and I know the Angels are there and all, and so they're dead to begin with. The movie ends with them meeting up with Lucifer. How the movie closes is not a great story. I know it's a very good idea to be able to see the Angels and Lucifer in the next movie, The Last Judgment, which was actually a movie based on a book of the Bible. A true story to use some of the actors involved in it.

I'm sure a movie with no story at all wouldn't really be a success, although this is not a film with any real plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was released in Japan on DVD and DVD in the U. I don't know if they rented it here, I guess that it was shown here as Japanese films. I'm trying to find out about the English release, and I'm going to send an e-mail to the distributor who is responsible for this movie. This was not released by VOD in Japan, and so, in any event, there are still copies floating around, and if I find out that VOD was the distributor of this movie, I'm not sure if they're going to be happy with me.  There are still people out there watching this film, and they may be able to find a copy on VHS or DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest, I did watch this movie at the end of its original run because I was curious about it. The first movie was very important for the movie making industry. If you look at the "The Matrix" sequel, for example, you will notice the lack of the first movie's ending credits. I don't know what is with these guys. I will never understand how they managed to pull off a movie that they spent any real time on, nor would I recommend it to anyone. The only good thing I can say about the film is that they did make some small alterations to the opening credits.

The camera angles that had the camera on the side of the camera were actually very close to the ground (like in a mirror). The camera also tilted downward when they were filming the scenes where it is facing upward, and the camera was directed so that it showed the ground in the same angle as the other scenes and that they were so far off-center that it was painful to watch, and of course, the scenes were shot in an ugly way, and too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie wasn't really that bad and there were some pretty good movies in it - especially the first one (1934). That is because the American film industry hadn't really moved to the United States in quite some time and so we had been in the business long enough to know that they would have some "guest workers" and so perhaps it was the "guests" from Germany (the "German Americans" as I call them) or the American workers that were hired that were being paid, perhaps the local workers were being hired for more money and I can't really say I blame them - they have been in these trenches before and I think that maybe they were more seasoned and better trained at that time and the "German" workers were still learning their trade and I am certain they knew how to treat their German "guestic" neighbors better than these Americans were at the time of their employment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "man" who starred in "Man with the Golden Arm" is a man with a beard. "Man" is about a man, his life, his emotions, his mistakes, his successes, and not an emotionless character. The "Man in Black" is portrayed as an emotionlessly cold character. We hear him speak. It is his choice to do so, but he is a terrible man, and a truly awful movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a mess. I went to see this because I was curious what it would be like. I have never seen such crap that was created by any way.  I wish I had a movie and movie of my own because if this was any more than a movie made by the "Gods" themselves, I would not recommend it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The two leads in this film are pretty good actors. There are probably two or three other stars in it that have a great deal of screen time in the American film, like the two leads. I was really surprised by how few of them there were. There is a pretty good plot in there and that they were working on in the past, so I'm willing to give them some credit. They're good actors and that there is more than one female character in it. That's why they were getting such a call from the producer to use the screen time they did get. The female character is supposed to be a pretty important one and I'm sure that when they were using her in the "American film," they wanted her to be in it more so than they would have done in a German film. The story isbutbutbutthat there is no movie worth your time or money (especially the German film version) at the end of the day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know why, but it must be because this has to be the only movie of it's kind. This movie is one of the worst films ever put on TV, there is nothing to recommend this piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just a few weeks ago when I bought the DVD. The movie was released in 1988. I'm sorry, that the only person who would know what movie this is is me, so don't go on IMDb, or even YouTube. I hope the person who did watch it, like myself, is not offended by this movie, and I was hoping they would be able to review this, as it is, without being able to see the picture, in hopes of the movie coming out on DVD, as a "throwback" to the original movie, or with the "tape" aspect (for people who don't mind this) or something like that. If I could buy a DVD of this movie (or anything else on DVD for that matter) for this movie is a real, "retro" kind of movie, which is really just another reason for me to watch the original version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A woman, named "Debbie Reynolds", who I met at a club a couple of years ago, tells me she has to watch a "special" DVD, which I believe was a special Christmas movie or something, or that she's a big fan of the movie or the director or something. Well, she has a copy of this movie. It's not called "A Christmas Story" or "A Miracle". The film is "A Day in the Life of Debbie Reynolds", and it looks like it was made for a special audience (not in the theaters) and is pretty poor on every level. I'm sure a lot of "reporters" are going to comment about "this film" being a "holiday-message film", and maybe they're going to be really offended by it, like some of the other "reporter" reviews (not to mention all the "journalists" on the internet), and I'm going to say this movie is not the best of it either. Debbie Reynolds' character is very weak in comparison to the "beauty", "glamour" and "possessions" she is portrayed as being, a very dumb and stupid girl. She is not in the least bit sexy, and her character is too old for her own good. Her hairstyle is the same hairstyle that she has been seen wearing for years. She has never actually met anyone in her life that was old. She talks about this as though her character somehow deserves special treatment in life and is very foolish. When she tells me how old she was, it's a joke. Debbie, please, you're supposed to be in her 60's, she's going to die alone, and you have to be more realistic with your own life, you know? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is hard to believe that the director of Titanic came into this, as the "tent" is a piece of cardboard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out as a comedy about the "jolly" guy who runs around with a baseball bat. I'm a huge fan of those guys, they're probably the funniest guys around. And I loved the original movie, with a lot of comedy, just like I'll be talking about in my review of the movie, the original comedy. And, although the guy in this movie is actually named "Jock," and I do remember him in the original film, he was so stupid, his character in this film was so terrible, there are no redeeming aspects to the character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast of the movie is about 10 people, most of whom, in my opinion, are acting. We are supposed to think that this is an independent film, a piece of real American art, that these are the people who would act in this movie, and in fact, one of my co-workers got to see this movie for the first time, and she loved it but was confused about what it was about, and I think we all, if this is our last movie, would like to know who, exactly, is this movie about. I have to say, if you watch this movie with someone, or with a few friends, that you watch it at night, it's absolutely worth your time, if not for a documentary.  But, if we all had the same idea that we were going to see a doc, you would go, "You know, I don't think it's really going to end like this, this is going to go somewhere about the real history of the U.S., which was probably done in this way," and I am hoping this film can really make a change in this film, as it was supposed to do, to make it about a real documentary that would help us understand the true history of a real place, but I'm not sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love "Ella" (Elliott's performance) and thought that this performance might just be a little bit better than the "Elliots" in this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all honesty, I had a positive review about this movie, that would've been the movie that's the premise of this review, or at least the premise is a good movie, and I hope I get to see it soon, or even better, have seen it before.  This movie is like a disaster. It's been very badly put together, badly acted, badly directed, and the film is absolutely bad.  There is a lot of bad stuff going on, and some good things here, and that's what makes this film so terrible, and not funny, not fun, and really only worth a laugh for people who want to laugh at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I wanted to know the real world, it would be on video or in a movie, not on video.  I had the opportunity to watch an hour and half of this movie on the DVD box. That is the only reason I watch this on video now. And I can not recommend it. The whole movie was shot on video at least. This movie was a "movie-within-a-movie" and filmed on film in the 70s.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this film for almost a week, and the only thing that I have read in a book is the film's title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know this has been a very long movie, I can only imagine that it was very long by comparison to the other movie, so let me start off by saying that this was not a very good comedy. This was not the only time I ever had this movie, or did I just catch this from the other film. This is not a movie that was created with a bunch of big names who have been in the business for years (and I love big names). It wasn't made for a bunch kids who are just learning to laugh. It is not the sort of movie that has a lot of big laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I had the book (and read the book, and saw how it was received) I was not a huge fan of the book. I think it is more of a romantic novel (with the main character of Willy Loman). That is why, of course, people read it. This is a completely different movie. While the movie is called "The Great Gatsby" (i.e. The Great Garson), it is sobutchered, terrible, horrible, terrible. I can't recommend it for anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason that I watched this is because I was asked to, as a friend, watch this movie, and then I went to the library. The reason why I went into the library, and sat down with friends, is that I wanted to see this film as an independent film, and not as a part of this movie. It's a shame because the movie is about a woman who is getting older, and it is true that it's a movie about a young woman (like "The House That Ruth Built"), and that is the reason for my friends sitting down with me. This movie doesn't have the same feeling that "House". I was very scared when I saw "House", because it was the first movie I ever saw, and I loved that movie, because it had an evil house with the "evil housekeeper", or the old lady with the cane, or the little girl in the hospital, and they were in a hospital, in a mental hospital, etc, and the idea was that the woman in this movie had "mental health", or that I needed to see it for some kind of lesson.   I saw this movie at the TIFF, and so many people were in tears, and many people walked out of it feeling very uncomfortable, or they were very scared, and had some funny moments. There's a lot of scary things in movies, because this is a horror movie. I was more scared watching this movie after 10 minutes of watching it, because but the movie really goes back to the very beginning, about four women, and that's when the story is very simple, and doesn't really go into any of the horror elements, and in the end, it just sort of ends, and you have a very short and boring ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been a huge fan of Woody Allen, and if you are, this is a pretty terrible film. It is not funny, it is not entertaining. I am not sure if it is Woody Allen's fault or not, I am just tired of watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really want to go to a movie theater in NYC where the next weekend is, and I plan on going and seeing a "good" movie with a good cast. This is what I can see of it, and if anyone else has an opinion of the movie, please let them know, because I don't know if it's just me and the people who have seen the movie so far, or if it could help some people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happened with this movie is not what it's supposed to be. It's a horrible film, awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has an almost completely unknown cast, which is made up of actors who had performed in many different films, ranging from comedies, dramas, documentaries, and, yes, horror films. It was not a good surprise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little bit of time in the movie could be spent on this movie... If you have the stomach for the movie, it might be worthwhile to watch this movie. I was so bored, this was bad in every way. Don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen some of the older reviews that had this movie at the top of its game, I didn't understand how a director or actor could make such a film.  Some of the actors were the same one in the earlier movie (Preston Foster), so I am not really going to give them any more of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am from a large family and we are so used to a nice family atmosphere. This is the second film in the series, and after watching it, I feel that I was robbed. This movie is full of cheap thrills.  If you enjoyed "The Last Unicorn", this will be more akin to "The White Queen". The "The Lost Queen" movie was pretty good because it was about finding the lost Unicorn and this movie is more akin of a horror film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't understand some of the dialogue in some of these "dialogue" videos that these people have because that film was shot in the early 80's. The characters are the same as in the first film (with the exception of the guy who does the narration for the movie), which is a problem because they aren't very memorable, especially the women. The best of the four actresses is probably Gretchen Mol (the one who had her role in "The Sound of Music," and she's a bit different than the others). And I had fun with Joan Blondell, whose role in the original film was so fantastic. And she didn't have the same "glamour" here. The ladies (especially the blonde) are quite pretty, I must say that I have a tendency to see a lot of the blonde actresses in films with their hair pulled back or in their hair in some tight styles, the kind that make them look like pretty maids. This was quite an interesting look back then, and when I saw her in this film, I felt it was more suitable for a woman who was a bit older (about my age) than this film is, and they would be much prettier. The girls aren't too pretty either, and there was a really good female character in Gretchen in the "The Best of Times" that was pretty good in this one (that film was really very feminine). This is a kind of movie for the lady with a husband, which is really pretty, and has the beautiful blondes in it. So if a lady can do what the girls do here, who knows? I haven't seen "Little Women" so I'm not familiar with the idea of "Little Men." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What would have made this a great film in the late 80s and early 90s with such great actors like Val Kilmer and John Lithgow (the actors of Val Kilmmer's The Pursuit of Happiness in The Pursuing of Happiness, for example) The movie centers on Val Kilman's character Jack Palance (played by Val Kilmore) and it really is a film with Val Kilmeester, Val Kilmen (a former Kilmeister), Val Kilmandri, Val Kanderin, Val Morris, Val Molin, Tim Pallis, Tim Robinson and Val Moloney (the latter of whom played a very important role in the film's marketing campaign and who was Kilmeesters's regular on-screen partner). "The Man in Black", "Val Kilmeesting", "Jack Palance", "Drew Kilmeeting" and "Val Morins", while not the last three of them (the first three being Val Kilmond), were good Val Kilminster/Lithgow-led films in their time.  Val Kilmann's Val Kilming-type character is the film version of Val's "Val Kiling" character from "The Pursuit Of Happiness", a movie starring Val Kilmon.  "Val's" character is a total flop.  There's something wrong with every frame.  I really wanted to be in for a second viewing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been involved in movies since the 70's, and I had to make a decision about whether I should watch this or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that bad.  This was a low budget flick that was supposed to be low-rated.  I didn't enjoy the low budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to bash the movie that came out on DVD or VHS or some other medium.  It's not a bad film, it's about as bad as a bad picture.  I would say that if I hadn't seen it by now, I was very scared of this movie.but that's what I wanted to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was, well, really good. It was a good idea for a horror movie with the characters and the concept of making it more similar to a remake of Night of the Living Dead. The people who made the original were great horror film creators and the people who were in charge of Night were great people, so I thought that they would be involved in this film. I was really disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would have been easy to find out why I watched this movie. The acting was awful. All of the actors were drunk, or they were in good shape. They were all on-screen, so I'm guessing they were doing some sort of performance.  And this is a movie about "The Great One", so why are they doing any kind of performance in this movie, and the movie would be a "must-see", which I don't recommend at all, and I'm a sucker for a good story. I enjoyed the story of "Barry Lyndon", and was intrigued by the "Great Expectation" that came from the movie "The Man from Snowy River" (which was about the Great War). And so it was that I just happened to see this movie at my local video store when I went to purchase the DVD.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My brother and I went to see the movie at the local movie theater, and we thought we had it pretty close with an old fashioned little movie in black and white, because we thought that there would be a lot of "spooks", and there would have been scary monsters or something like that.  It just was a little boring and too many things happening. We ended up really wanting a scary, scary movie. And this movie did not end up in a movie that we would watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really should have been released in the early 90s and if they had I would have given it one of the highest ratings. This is a very poor "movie" by any standard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, the movie is supposed to be "anti-feminist", which could've made the movie more "anti". The second part of the movie deals with how to "help women", which again could've been the first part of this movie. The third part of "how to help women" deals with the question of the film's theme, i.e. feminism.  I think the fact that this movie is a "film about" feminism is a great reason to watch this movie because it will help you to see the issue of the women's right to choose, but unfortunately it is also a reason that this is a movie that doesn't deal with the issue that is "feminism". The way the "movie" deals is really confusing and illogical and just plain wrong. I mean, how can you, in any rational manner, think that "the women that you are supposed to help are not victims!"  The "movie's" director doesn't even understand the word "femme".  There is not one, but three or four scenes in the entire movie that deal with a "sexual relationship" between a man and woman, and he even has the gall to lecture the director about his own lack of knowledge.  What can we say? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really had high hopes for this movie. It's got a great script and I have no doubt that this would make a movie worth talking about. It was the first movie about a little girl, and it's still in the world, so it's not about time or budget. A young adult's story isn't the first and the last thing on our minds. We're talking about movies for adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did enjoy watching the first film about the history of Japan. When the main character meets up with the "hero" and the main hero of this movie, I have to say that there is a lot more to this film that I can only really enjoy in a 90 min. The second film is a true Japanese drama, and there are many great actors there, but this is really a movie about how the production and the director is dealing with a lot of the Japanese press, and not for the first time. I am very interested in seeing this film and will give my opinion on it in an article soon but the reviews are pretty harsh and they could have been harsh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I haven't seen it, so I'm not going to give you my own opinion.  I was a big fan of "ROCKY TOPPING". I don't mind if you see it. I liked Rocky. I think he went through hell and came back. So I'm hoping that the other guy would do some research and make a movie. I guess the only thing that can be certain is that it will be at a lower budget. If I don' like it I'll see a movie that is about something more exciting (like, say, "MAN ON FIRE" or "MAN IN GOLD"). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had read this book, and in fact, I was reading this book when it came out in '86, so it was the equivalent of someone's '60's hippie dream.  I don't blame the author for being naive, because if I were starting out today, I would probably expect this movie to be an '80's 'Dirty Dozen' (just because of what it has been tagged as).  In my opinion, this is the worst film of all time, not even a '60'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of 'The Godfather' and 'Godfather II'. There are two reasons why I chose this movie. One was the opportunity to see it on DVD and two was my wife. She really wanted to watch it. It was her pick. That was the only reason I can find why it's on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was just one guy, so I'm guessing that most of his friends were in it at the same time I was. I know this is supposed to be a comedy and a comedy about my friend who got his degree, and I hope that this film isn't about me. If he is reading this, I sincerely hope that I don't have to go to a movie called "My Funny Friend" and see it because if that is the case, I would seriously consider my friends in that movie to be my friends and to just do the best they can. If it is not, then I sincerely apologize for wasting their time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why I even bothered with this movie. It could have been funny, because it was filmed in the early 90's.  The actors are terrible. It's hard to believe they ever played this many professional baseball games. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a big fan of Hollywood movies. Maybe it's because of the lack of box office takings (but I would certainly not recommend to start with it, if you want to see how I ended up). It was just, as I write this in my home office, an afternoon-in-the-office film made for the pleasure of watching it on the TV. I do own it and will do it justice on the big screen, and I'm quite certain that I was not missing much. As for the other film I saw it was about a couple of people on a fishing expedition, for a good cause (the fishing was so good in those films, so it was worth doing).  It's only natural that it would have had a much bigger budget. It would be a real tragedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie that I can really remember, it's probably because it was only made in 1974, and I was 7 when it was made, and this is the original 1977 version. In 1977, this movie will be rated PG-13, because the filmmakers, who apparently were trying to re-create the old "Teenage Mutant Hero" cartoon, decided that they would make a PG-rated version of the film. I am sure they had the rights to do that, and since they are not really doing this for kids, it will probably be a little more tame than the new "Teenager Mutant Hero." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not very familiar with some of the actors from the other film (I haven't seen their characters before), it's possible that they've changed some of their characters, in which case, I thought I'd take an in depth look into some of these other characters, which would make this movie better and more entertaining. Unfortunately, the movie has been edited. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was so disappointing.  I'm a huge fan of the show. I'm also a big fan of their music and their songs and their art. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a bad film, it's a bad one with a bad ending. "I feel like I was really drunk when I wrote this, and I've never been drunk, but it's really dark. I liked that it had a bit of horror, because I've written many horror movies with no sleep or nothing in between", but I still think this film should have been made in the 80s, the 70s, or even the 50s, with the end result being a more "grim" and "spooky" film. The plot and the ending make it look like it was done just for a commercial, and a great deal of the film is filmed during the night, with a lot of black and white, as you can see below, and this is just so bad. This film really was about going to a hotel and staying the night. I really wanted to make a film about how I met a woman that was on the streets and we could have done a really good, real, creepy, and scary film about a woman in a hotel, in the middle of the night that was so unbelievably creepy and just made it seem like a "horror film", not horror. I'd like to see this movie completely shot, edited, and done from start to finish so that it would be a truly, really awesome movie. It is absolutely not the "night of the living dead", horror, "slumming" movie that I saw when I saw this on T.V.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm actually a big fan of a movie that is a 10+ by the way, it's called "The Biggest Loser" and is actually a great film by the actors.  It's about a group of people, not a bunch of strangers and most certainly wasn't done by the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not a comedy at all, and it's very poorly acted, and the acting is awful! If you liked the "Scary Movie" then you'll feel the same when watching this film... If you're a horror buff, you'll be bored out of your mind, and when the movie was over, you felt sad and guilty...  I am glad to see that the "B" is being released next week, and I have watched this film since it was released (as I was supposed to).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it with my friend who works in a video store, and in this movie, you're going to see a lot of "b" videos. It was kind of funny that "b," that they put out for the store. (and they have an online store that sells "b").  They used to put out the "b", or the "brick" videos, so you see, there are no "f" or "m" videos either. And the one that is the biggest in the store is a "bricking machine." (I've been in many video stores in the past, and have to say that "bricked" is probably the most popular "bricker")  I think that's probably more of a joke in the video store world, and probably one of their "pranks," and the video is about a really serious issue here that this video deals with: "bracing." If you've ever seen a car with a "crack-door," you'll know what they do to it, so what's it like to have a "b." It's very scarybutbutbutthey're just not there anymore. They're "broken," so I guess that's the only reason that they got the "new" DVD cover on this one. I guess "broken" is better than "broken." They're just "broken like real bricks." If the video was a DVD, I think you would be mad at them for doing this. I think, for a video that is only supposed to be for home use, they should use new parts, and a new one for the video. That's not "bricoleur." I give them an 8 on the original rating, because I thought that they were good for this, and were, for this being a "video," an "80." I think they did get this one up on Amazon, so I'll give them the same score, but "braced." "So what's next?"  It's going to be hard for them to keep my ratings down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of my main reasons for watching this movie was that it's supposed to be a comedy.  This movie is about a terrible, terrible movie that really had to do with the budget and just because of the quality of the movie itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In short, the movie is good for the way that it contains a bunch of interesting characters and they appear to be normal, like a high school kid's, or at least non-psychological. It is interesting to see the story of the kid named "Judd" because it deals with the question of what happens in the mind of a kid who was abused and why. I just hope that it is not too long. There is a lot of bad movies out there with the word "psychological." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing in the film is that it could be about the lives of those who died in the second world war. The film's focus is more on the lives and experiences of those involved in the conflict, which is fine. I think it's appropriate to focus on that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the movie, I would like to say this, I enjoyed watching the classic films. It is not like I was trying to imitate a bunch of other "kids". After all, it is a "classic" movie, it can be expected to have some pretty good acting. The cast in this movie isbutbutbut but it is not good enough to really be considered a "kid's" film. It has some really creepy-looking kids in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw this movie, I did have to make do with a little bit of the trailer. At that point, I had a vague idea of it being a sequel to the first one. I thought the first movie was "The Spy Who Dances in Closet" and this one would be "The Secret Agent" or something like that. It is "The Spy" (yes, it's really a "Spy" - I think that's all the time I would spend on this movie). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea why I had to sit through this movie, I would just like to make it a point that if you are watching this movie and don't care about being funny you can probably take it to be seriously because I really like to watch comedy so you can't judge the outcome of this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film does have a bit of a happy ending. I mean "I am from Ohio and I am so happy" that's still a happy film, I am not sure what the director was trying to say with this film.  This is one movie you are going to sit down and have a few laughs with, not one movie that I'd even recommend this to be seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is really poor. They did good work in the first film, and were using the first movie to promote the first one. There is a scene in the movie that has one of the actors (Wong's son) in the same room. The other actors are so desperate and poor at everything else. The director has nothing more to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a good movie for the director because he was the writer on the screen and worked on the movie with the cast. With "The Secret of Sesame Street" the director was under no obligation to work with the Sesame Workshop anymore, and the SESH would like to work directly with the Disney corporation, and while there are many good people within the SBS, it would be a shame to put their reputation on the line for the sake of this film. They are, sadly, being exploited for the benefit of the film's director, and they would do well to see some of what they do not have, which is a large part of the profits on the "Secret of SBS." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I'm a fan of Jerry Lewis who is one of the main actors in this movie.  I don't think the Jerry Lewis fans will get the joke of this film, I think it's a good comedy. Jerry Lewis' character is stupid. He gets his money with a bunch of friends in a local bar, and after that he goes off to the police department and he goes into the police station.  And then Jerry Lewis is the one who tells the audience that he's a veteran. Well, he's got the same name as a veteran, Jerry Lewis. He also has a son. He's got a son in the same uniform as he wears now. He was in the Marine Corp. He knew what it's like. He'd have been in the Marines.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second film and the "Second Life" community has already established itself. The Second Life community already has been around for nearly 10 years (1997-1999) and is well-known and respected by many in the Second Life. The only two people involved in this film are the directors, writer/editor and the one assistant writer and that assistant. The other two main players are the producer and the writer/director of the "Liferell" film and that was an independent film. This film is not going to help you get past the end of this film, because if you are in a coma...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went and saw the movie the night of this review. It was a Friday evening showing.   If I remember the movie well, it was about two guys who went on a hunt for their lives and ended up on a remote island. I went to the island to see how the film was going to end, after having seen the film, I went back and ended the movie, with the two guys getting a ride back to town. I would guess that they were having a nice time, like any good horror movie should be. They were not, I have seen, in this movie, or, for that matter, are ever going to be in "The Wild." This is a low budget horror film with the cast. They had a good thing going, and with some good acting from some good actors.  The director is not the best filmmaker, he's obviously trying to "up the ante" and raise his profile as a director, for whatever reason, and he should be looking to find a way to do that, as the film is the type that can stand alone or be combined with a few other films.  There are some scenes and one scene where the camera is moving through some woods. The scene looks like something from a real horror movie, and, yes, you can go find some real horror here. In fact, there are many of them. I know some of them, and I watched a few of them in "Cocktail of Horrors" (the classic slasher film). I really don't think it's necessary to "jump into the swamp." They had some good stuff in this town in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this as part of a television network's late night show, and was looking for a comedy that, I figured, would take an hour. I am a guy who finds a lot of humor in comedy. I'm not looking to ruin that for you. As the credits roll I realize that these "comedies" were made at a time when it was considered "cool" to be a comedy (not for the masses), and are, to my knowledge, not considered "comedy" anymore. You can tell in the way of the editing, the dialogue. It has a completely amateur feel. It's awful. The first ten minutes are the worst and the movie plays with a really amateur, cheap, and cheap looking fake camera, a horrible sound effect, bad lighting, horrible special effects. All in all, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm going to admit it, this movie isn't a masterpiece. If you've seen the other two movies you've had some clue as to what happened during the earlier ones. I'm hoping that there's a new generation of filmmakers that will be influenced by the great movies that were made in the 1940's and 1950's.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that I could really find that was worth watching was the very end - I can't say I'm being a victim - and to say I was completely shocked would be far too presumptuous, and I don't want to watch this crap. It's awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really did not expect this movie to be the greatest film of all time. As for the best film of 2001, that was, of course, 2001: A Space Odyssey. I don't know why, or what, the makers of the new version of this film, decided to make this one. What a horrible movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with me being interviewed for the movie in the lobby of a hotel that doesn't have a clue I've played the role in a couple of films and was interviewed in an actual movie. Now this movie starts in a hotel and then proceeds to give interviews to hotel guests. This is a complete mess, I could even see myself in the first 30 minutes of this film. It should have been at least 4 hours long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very open about wanting to watch this movie because it's a movie called "The Big Bang Theory" and if anyone is from the UK or the US, it should have been no problem to understand my question:  The movie is called "Bang," and you get to the end of the movie. There is no mention of the science behind the movie in any form. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a completely different movie from the one I watched 10 years ago. The only similarity is the "The Godfather." I don't know if this movie is for kids, adults, and the like. I don`t know who wrote this thing. It`s a horrible piece of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had friends or acquaintances who have loved to watch a movie for their life that I've known to love to do in other film productions, so I can't say how they are going to make some change in their minds, the movie starts off with two of the characters having their eyes shut in some strange way, or a weird way, they're just looking at each other. This is not the beginning of the movie. A friend of mine, who is a very good writer and can make a really good movie, said something to the effect that this movie was about two people, then I remember having seen a little bit of it in the theater at some point. And I had also just seen it in Toronto, where it was very close to the beginning. I don't understand why this movie is in Canada, as it is not even available in Canada until sometime next week. It is a strange, terrible mess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was in some ways the story of a true story. In that respect the movie did try to use a "script" and try to tell me how to act. It tried to be in the style of "Witch Hunter" (it should be mentioned here that "Wizard Hunter" is also the movie I had seen before at the MGM Studio in Culver City, California) and try and tell me what kind of character I was playing as and to try and convince me that I was doing what a Witch Hunter would do. They were trying to tell us about how this was my second Witch Hunter, and how a true Witch Hunter acts in certain ways (the Witch Hunter is, after all, supposed to be a person who lives in the forest). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really boring movie. It's not even worth the time I put into watching it. I've never been more depressed, nor have I ever felt more awful. I have no idea how it could possibly be a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of the movie is a bit strange at first, after the character's have been completely transformed in the previous movie.  The film isn't about the film itself, and it's not about my movie. The director wants to make sure that everything gets across on a cinematic level - so I guess it is his responsibility to see it through with me - if he fails to do so, the movie will turn out awful. I have the utmost respect for all my fellow actors and I hope that all my colleagues could be given enough time to get in touch with the film director and discuss this matter with him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One day, I went to the movie theatre. One of the first movies was, I believe, about the American Dream and the others were about the United States.  In this movie, I have no clue what the point was, since it was such a poor movie, and there was very little suspense at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of this show. I think it was an interesting project. I was particularly interested in hearing some comments about how this was a'realistic' show and the like. I had my doubts whether this show would be well received by others, especially since I was a big D&D player and am well versed in the'real' game and therefore didn't really think much of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing this movie on the DVD. I have been a fan of the film since I saw it at Sundance and this film is really something for a really big Hollywood studio to make. It's very sad that we had to have this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have already written an extensive review about the best movie of the past 20 years.  This film does not have much humor, and it is not that bad. I have seen much worse films.  I think it might be more difficult to believe that people are thinking that this film is for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never watched this movie before, and that was a fairly serious movie. This one was made in 2001, and it does not seem to have a definitive ending. The end of the film is really messed up, and the end of it was kind of like when I saw it on VHS.  I'm sorry to admit that the movie was the only one I had that actually had the movie DVD, so I'm just going off what I've seen so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't want to watch this movie. I thought that perhaps it would be a good, fun comedy to watch in the spring.  I think that even those who have seen it in the summer are surprised by how bad it is. I'm so glad that this movie was shown on cable TV, because it had a chance to reach some people that would be interested in this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been watching the TV show for about 10 years and was looking forward to getting a copy of this DVD. I had just read the book the night before and, having just read, was excited to get to the store.  The book was so well written and it wasn't difficult to follow and with some of the actors from the TV series. I just wish that I would have been better able to follow what was happening on the screen in the movie. In the beginning, it was so interesting to see the "big" show's style and personalities and I was happy to see how the show was trying to be "sassy". As the show began to follow the style of the show that ran on TBS, it became very annoying and I found that this was a show that really "wasn't really a show." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to say that this film is one of the first "low budget" films ever, since the time when it was released in the late 60's. If so, it's really unfortunate since since this is a film that has the potential to shock audiences, it has a pretty good storyline (the lead, Billy Crystal, is a respected actor, as he is in the musical version of this), but the casting of the film is pretty horrible and it's not just bad looks, it doesn't just "look" bad, it just sucks from the beginning. I'd be shocked to have any respect for Billy Crystal as an actor; he's a veteran and respected actor and if he were to look like this, no matter how good he was in this role, I'd have to say it. This was not my favorite film, but it wasn't terrible and since it was originally made, I thought it was going to be a movie that was going the same thing as the musical that it was to do a musical western, I would be shocked if it was even good (though it's far too late in the game, I hope this can be corrected) and the entire thing looks like it was filmed in the 1990's. It's not only horrible, it ruins the whole premise of the movie and it absolutely ruins the film, and there are plenty of scenes that really make you squirm.  The acting is pathetic, it does not make Billy Crystal a great guy. And the plot is, at times, like an actual film, which is truly an insult.  There's a scene in this film that involves a beautiful (and sexy) woman and it would be a tragedy, a great loss for the man.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest, this movie is really hard to understand, and since you can't see what the actor is talking about, you really have no clue as to what he is talking, what's he's doing, and his performance is really boring, and really weak. It is one of those movies you can watch to pass the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was good. The director of the movie was trying to recreate the old "Who Shot Liberty Valance" movie (the only difference was that the director made the Liberty Valancy movie a short, which was an attempt to do justice to the fact that the "Who shot Liberty Valances" movie was 90 minutes long).    For is about the same length as "WhoShotLibertyValance".  After the first hour of "WhoShootLiberty", you already know that the Liberty is not in a good condition. I guess I was very lucky to be able to see the movie last night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a true fan of the film, I can't stop thinking about this film every single day after it's over. How could they have cast this movie for the best part? It was one of the worst of the six, and not even on the list of those I'd be watching for.  The only reason I found this film worth watching is because of the other movies I'd seen. And that was for their humor and their message.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this as an adult movie, and it's weird, but nothing more. It's very very un-original. I felt sorry for all the actors who were working on the movie, all of them, and I didn't feel like watching this for a second. A movie should be an art movie, with a strong cast and good acting. The first two "B" movies were about nostalgia, and this is a very weak movie that didn't make it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that will show at the Toronto International Film Festival next month, with the movie "Saving Grace" on HBO, with whom the filmmaker has made a number of documentaries in the past. I think this movie is just like "S" -- bad. Why? This movie is not just about "S", which is about the story of how a real person would be portrayed, and it is not a movie to see if you want to "see for yourself". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched it for the fact that it had been released on DVD.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are all very talented, I've seen quite a few of them. I was very curious as to how they would fare in this film. I had a couple of friends watch it, and they had good opinions on it (I like them). I thought the film had some great lines: "What do you think about the big bad wolf, "The Big Bad Wolf," and "You should've seen it when it first came out," for instance. If this film were to follow the story of "The Road Runner," where the film is based, then the big man would be in pursuit of the Big Bad wolf, and the big woman would be chasing a man who would chase her husband. The other women would chase other men, the little girl would chase a girl of the same age, etc. These little details will probably not do the film justice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I was to rate this movie on a scale of 10 to 1, I would give it the 10 rating, as the actors were completely unknown to me.   You do the best to be critical as to whether or not they're actors, as I was not in the habit of doing that when I was a kid, I have to say, you may have to look them up as soon as possible. You don't have to think you know them.  I found the movie to be completely inept and boring. It had everything. Why it should've been any different is baffling to me, as disappointing as it was, and I was very disappointed in it. There is no reason for it to be made any longer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What are we to do? The only real pleasure in the movie is watching the title, so I guess I'm getting paid for it... I found the plot, boring.   The acting is bad. I was watching a lot of bad Italian movies that I thought the dialogue was cheesy. This movie was about to break me down by the end. I'll admit I liked the direction, as I did a lot when I watched this film.  If you're a true fan of the film, don't think of this as "a real movie." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had an odd-man-out ending and there were other weird-men-out endings in the '50s and '60s. The movie itself is about a group of four guys who were all born in 1958--about the same time--to try to recreate the original formula. This "Rescue" is about five men who are all members of the original "Rent-A-Wreckers" crew and they attempt to recreate a formula that was about to go out of business.   The original Rent-A Wreckers was about one hundred men and their attempt to remake this formula was about 200 men. And that is the story of their own story--their own success story. The new "Riskers" are about 40 men and two women--with a total of about 300-400.  I mean, I am not sure if these are "men" or "women"--they were only in my mind about 50 yards apart--in terms of their heights--and they are still in the same body--with the same face and the same haircut.  That is the only difference in appearance.  A man could not really tell the difference between these people, even though they might look completely different. I mean it's just not my cup of tea--this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I sat down to watch this film, the wife, who is my mother-in-law, and we watched a movie in the park with a different couple and had our hands on each other for 10 minutes and it was wonderful, but the mother-daughter story has me thinking "Why do I need to know who is she going to marry?" I mean, I would watch this movie with my family or a group of friends and have my hands free.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen some of the great films that were made in the last 10 years. This was the movie that was made for the kids.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm one of those guys who likes to watch the movie with my friends. I watched this on TV, in the dark, with no special effects, no voiceover, and no explanation. It's just a big bunch of people running around and trying to kill each other.   That's not all. After a little bit of running around in some of the towns in New Jersey, I realized this was a movie about the U.S. Marine Corps.  As an active-duty Marine, I was just a little concerned about people getting killed by "my guys." And what really got my attention, at least the first time, was "I think you're a sniper." There are people who know a lot more than the movie makers about the nature of combat. And this is not a war movie, and there's no real reason to think this movie is an action movie. It seems like a comedy. That is, as I watched it, the best way to describe it. It could have made the mistake of turning into the other genre with a lot of action, or of the movie being an action thriller, or even a drama, because that's the one where people like the movie.  The U.K. army doesn't laugh, it's not funny, it doesn't get laughs from us, or that I have seen. There is no redeeming quality to this movie, the only thing that I found in it was the movie is about a man who can't run. We must get this movie to theaters and see if it can be changed to be a movie that's about men running through town.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As it is now, the movie could be about the great adventures and adventures the characters had in the book, like in the very best adventure novel that I've ever read. It is this movie that has been released as part of the "lost adventures of Captain Nemo" DVD series. This is also the DVD version of the movie "A Voyage of Discovery", in which the director had the rights to use those adventures as well. It was a "movie for kids", or "movie about Captain Nemmy" or "the lost adventures of Sir Arthur Robinson", or the "Captain Nemo movies" - "A Captain Nemu Adventure", "The Adventures of Captain NEMO", or similar to it.  This is the first "movie" with the title "The Lost Adventure of Captain M: Nemo's Return".  "The Nemo-Olympics" DVD is still in its original "Nemo-Nemos" box, with the new logo for the Olympic games, and it is only available to the USA - this is the one with the old logo, with its "lost" and "missing" parts. This means that most of the DVD's out there are not the "film" they once were - the film has been completely rewritten, and now consists of a prequel, and also a "romantic comedy" with love scenes that are butbutbutbutBUTbutbut BUTbutbut butbutBUTBUTbutBUT BUTbutBUT butbut BUTBUTbut butBUTbut BUT BUTbut BUT butbut but butbut!! This means the Nemo Olympics is a film that is basically just about Nemo. That's not a very interesting movie to watch for a couple of reasons: First, I haven't seen this movie in a while, and this was the very first time I saw the Nemos compete in any sort of sports (I'm pretty sure it was not a sports competition, although there is no reason to not do a little research here). It's a really interesting and educational story - it should be on television, not just a bunch of silly love scenes. I had great expectations from the original "The Adventure of the Nautilus", and from a story that would be quite good - this was a romantic movie.  I really enjoyed the story, especially in the original (I still have a lot of the Nemorino-Nautilus DVD set). I'm just not in the mood for another love scene

She returns to the island, and gets engaged to a beautiful man on the mainland who is of white descent.  She leaves again, this time getting engaged to her white fiancé, who is in a white dress.  I don't think that the Island people would like me to comment on that, and don't ask me to.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's no doubt that the production of this movie is well above the standard of an indie film. I'm not entirely sure why that is a surprise, I'm pretty sure it has to do with money. If it was for money, I believe the makers of this film would have found some way to raise some money for the production and distribution of this short film. After a long and tiring day of editing, I honestly felt the pain of the production. The music is just awful. The actors' voices are all over the place. If you're going to watch this, just make it through the whole thing. The worst part is that the director actually made this short into a film and actually put out a video of the final scene. The ending is completely unsatisfying. If I'd have seen it in a small movie, I would've turned it off and made it my last piece of work.

I remember one of those "Star Wars" movies where the computer was an ancient one, and it was a good thing then, and I believe that's what they used to do at West Texas Tech, where the computers in the old films were more modern ones. Also, they might have used one of the old computers, but even that wasn't such a horrible comparison to the new computers being used, as I don't remember the computers being so old. And I do recall that the old computer computer room was only a little more spacious. Maybe we could compare the computer room to the computer lab that they used in the original films, or something like that?  There is also something I have to mention that when the original film came out, they used a real computer to do their computer work. I don,t recall anyone ever being at the university being able to access a computer during that time, and being able access a real mainframe, and so being able get into the labs, but I didn't really know how the computer rooms were. I was just told about a computer lab being constructed, or the computer labs in a science building, so I don;t think there was much of a question.  The computer lab was about 2 stories tall, and the computer stations were about 1 story tall, so they are pretty small now, but they were large enough to fit in the computer department on campus. I guess that's something that they could make larger as the new labs are not only on a completely new campus, but are also on a campus that is not just one floor, but 2 story tall. I think it's more likely that they would have to move the computer station to be a little closer to the entrance of the new computer lab. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are only two people who are going to see this movie, but this movie is so horrible that it's like the best friend ever. It's really disappointing, and I've seen the DVD cover and it's only one-sided (it was bad when I rented it, so I'm going to rent it again.)  If you ever want to see an entertaining film, do not buy this movie. It isn't a good movie for anyone, really.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a lawyer, I cannot comment on the legality of the movie. It seems like the producers of this film are trying to cash in on the "I Am Spartacus" campaign, and it does appear that some have written it on to be an anti-war movie. A documentary about "I am Spartacus", made in the 1940's and titled "The War of the Lions", is now available on DVD, and the producer of the film says it is about "my own journey back to Africa and to Sparta". It's a shame that the people who made the documentary, who had the same idea, didn't get to do it, because I believe it would be very informative.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a rip off of the first movie. It's really an insult to any movie that was made from a true story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, the movie does have a lot of funny moments. For instance, there are several funny scenes (I will never forget how great "Friends" was). They did just have it on DVD, I think). Also, as I recall, there was one good spoof movie about the movie, called "The Movie: The Movie" starring the very talented John Candy. This is the first movie to be released in a couple of years.  This is "The Biggest Movie Ever", so obviously, the hype train is going to keep on going, at least for a couple more years. So I was not surprised to see the movie (that was pretty good). It is just that the movie is completely different in story and tone.  For starters, the film is completely incomprehensible and nonsensical. The main plot is about a "concierge", the French equivalent of a real estate agent, who lives in a castle, with a "private elevator" that leads up to the top floor of the castle, and there are hundreds of characters who are portrayed as a bunch of nobodies, all with a silly, meaningless plot.  The plot is ridiculous and incoherent. It could be a parody of the movie itself.   I'd be willing to read the screenplay, which would help. I can't find anything that says the word "good".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is just called "The Movie." I don't even know if it's about 10 or 15 minutes, if it is at all about that. You're talking about a movie that is going to be released soon, so it's not like it's just going to show up in the mail, or the video store, or on video at that point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The one thing I'm certain of is that the film is a low budget," according to my film critic. It looks like a low-budget horror movie, not to mention the fact that my film went into production after a three-month vacation. "There's nothing new in there," says my film reviewer, who also says that the director's lack of talent has ruined the film's reputation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I would like to say that this movie is a "horror film" movie. I mean, it's just a "slasher" movie that really. The first of the "slashers" would be the infamous "Slasher".  This is a slasher. A slasher that is NOT interested in women whatsoever, not interested in men whatsoever, and in the end, I don't know how he made this film. I haven't seen his films and I'm sure this film had nothing to do with the "director".  I know, I know. He has been known to give up at the last minute and I know that he's not a guy who gives up easily. He's a good guy, a very good guy.  As for the "films" section, it would be interesting to see the "film" section. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this film was going to be something more dramatic than just about anything else. I was very intrigued about the possibility of how it would be directed, and I love movies that have an objective point of view, even if the movie wasn't supposed to be an artistic one.  My partner and I were really looking forward to seeing this film since it was a documentary.  We expected to see it on DVD, and just so we could have all the knowledge about it.  After watching it was clear that it is a "documentary". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that the director and producer are going to be great. And I'm a big fan of them both. Maybe I'll find out about this movie when I go back in the future. I don't think it was made for the big screen. I really had to go in for awhile after the movie was over, and then try to wrap my head around some of the things I'd seen and seen with the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One day, about 3 years ago I watched this movie. The director was very nice and had done a movie with other people in it. He did not do another movie of this nature. One reason could be that he wanted to show the movie as a comedy and he could not. So, he might have wanted to see how it would be and show the film as a slapstick comedy or a horror comedy and, even that would have been better than what he saw and that would explain why he would not have made the movie.  I would recommend you look at this film on the subject of "Making Movies", especially if you have the ability to get a little bit of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been a while. I've gone on TV for several years, and when I'm doing that, I am more likely to come across such things.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like some of the people in the film and have seen some of their films, I just saw it in the theater. This film was in black and white, only in one of the shots. It was not in color. I did not watch any of the scenes from this film. I was so fed up with the scene in the airport, with the plane, when I was writing this review that I just started yelling at the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those "bad movie" movies from the 1970's-it was a comedy, and I think that's really funny for a comedy-it's the story that is totally wrong, and all of the characters are "bad," it's not funny.   I'm not going to waste my time watching it, even if it was "only" for fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the kind of movie where you go to the theatre and you say, "Oh, it's a remake or a remake of a bad film", so people who want to see this movie are better off buying it from a video store, because a video rental will not be able to take the time to really go into the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know, I think I'll just say that the movie is pretty bad. And it's only on DVD because there are no VCR's around, and it is pretty good that they have a commentary track, so that it can have a good, well-written conversation with the actors in it, which it should have had. The DVD edition has a DVD with the movie, so this is all my personal opinion and not based on some other people's opinion. And I want to say that I have no problem with any of the actors who do not do the movie (they all deserve to be in some kind of "re-imagining" of the movie), and just if there's a way of bringing back the original version, or at least having it out for a re-release, or if there is any film, film magazine, magazine review, or film that tells you otherwise, I want them to be pretty much certain that it's gonna be worth the effort and money, and there isn't one movie or magazine review out there telling you that they loved it and they didn't, which is kinda sad. It wasn't bad by any means, and I actually like that it was done by the guys over in London. I still think it is very hard to get actors to commit to such a small role, and you might end up getting a decent one, which means I do like them.   And the actors did good work in the movie and it made you feel like it was a different type of film (the idea was that the main character was actually a reporter), which would have been really interesting to see. And the director made a good effort with the music and so on, so I thought the movie was good (not the idea for the movie itself). My problem is that it is so hard to do something that's such a mini-feature, or to actually give the characters some depth. If I were to go on a real "reimagining," it could have been as short as a few hours and the characters were so different from the ones we had seen before. And, honestly, I don the way they were portrayed in the original, they just looked "super-hot" which would explain why they got such big breasts and huge hair in the TV show, because it was made as a comedy (but in the mini-movies they would have to be very sexy or else the audience would get confused).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the last few shows I saw of this, and I think I remember hearing an interview with the director on the last show of this series, I think he said something to the effect of this being the first one, or at least that it was one season.  This is one of those shows where they do a really good job with the acting of the actors, but at the end of the day, it's a 90-minute show, so you have to watch this to see what you want to see, if you want a 30-minute episode or 90-min episode of a show.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of making a film out of "this" really caught up with the director and his film "this". The movie does not make a great impression.  The movie has some nice moments in the beginning. It gives some insight on what life is like for these people who do not have the money to afford fancy Hollywood productions. If you watch the movie you see that the director had the guts to make the movie out of his own home. The story that he had written and then made into a movie is still in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know I'm an independent movie lover, it must be an indie film with an indie rating, but I'm surprised that people that have seen this film have rated it so highly. The film is mostly about a woman who falls in love with a guy in a hotel in New York. The man is a little too cute, he's handsome (no spoiler here), he's not stupid, he can act, he does have some great lines, and I liked to see him in his "Sidewalk Sam" role in "Casanova" as an ex-cop who was one of the best bad guys in the world (I loved to see John Cusack in his role as "The Godfather", he's also in "Blue Crush" where he's a cop in NYC). He's in the movie, but not in the hotel room with the lady, which is where the woman leaves the hotel with him. (You may want to see the film first.)   The woman leaves with her boyfriend, who is in love and falls madly for the man, leaving him very unhappy and even physically ill for some time after her leaving him, who decides not to do any more with her as she is, leaving her "Blue crush" to wander the streets of NYC. After the girl has to have a nervous breakdown and the girl's boyfriend decides to "retire" her, the film takes place several times in her apartment.  The film was never as great as a romantic comedy that would have been about the film's subject matter; the girl was pretty awful in a lot of her first scene, I found her acting pretty pathetic. She was very passive and pretty dumb in "Diary of a Wimpy Girl" when she was about to be "mascotized" in that film, so her first acting role is a definite precursor to her future career. (The girl in "The Blue Crush", for example, was an aspiring actress in "Blow" and so would have already been wearing glasses.) She's also very annoying as the girl with "Blue Crystal" who is trying to be so girly in this film, and you can tell that her parents are really worried about her. That's the type of girl that they raised her.  Even if the girl had been an incredible girl (she was very pretty), the girl would not be able to make any more money and do any type of movie for very long. Also, it

I don't know why they made me watch this when I could just watch the TV series. The only thing that's really funny here is that I got to watch this in the store, with the video, and you have to wonder if I did it right.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think that my friends who are very good in their field are doing a very good job of reviewing this movie, and I wish them the best of success with it. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is the kind of movie that a lot of Americans watch (a lot of the time, anyways). It was just released in theaters, so most of it was in movie theaters. It's an action movie about a bunch of Americans (as opposed to a comedy). The premise is bad, the dialog is terrible (most of it), and the end of the movie is really bad. The last scene is truly horrible and horrible. What a shame for such a cheap little flick that's all I can say.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film follows a group of five young people (a good idea) who are trying to find themselves and are trying not to get caught up in the world of the outside world. They all have dark pasts and some of them are dead.  This film is about their lives in the early days of their lives, which may be interesting because of their own personal tragedy. The film is a collection of flashbacks that are all from the viewpoint of the characters.  I can see how this would be interesting for the perspective of a character who had something to say about the film or that they were a little more involved in the story. These were the only people in the film that were actually able to actually be objective (and were more than just an actor) about the events that led them to where they were (aside from the director) and only in very brief flashbacks that gave me a brief sense of their state of mind, and the majority of the time they were presented in the form of a "memory".   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know there's an "honest" documentary being released by the same person who made the first documentary, and that the first one was released to the public.   And I know what I would do if I was going to spend the time to make this documentary, it would be to make a movie about a movie. That's the best way to make any movie in the world. But because of the people involved in this, it looks like it'll be a long time until the movie is actually completed.

I love "Girl With the Red Hair."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you can think of an actor who has the charisma and personality of Jack Palance in the original Palance film, do you think you can cast a person like Palance, or one that is similar to the new Palance.

I'm assuming they're going to sell this one on video at some point, with that in mind I'm watching this on cable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first film that I saw with the same title. This is "The House Party," and the whole movie is a bunch of teenagers running around. In "The Hangover Part 2," Jason Statham runs around with his dad in a race car (and Jason does the same thing in this film). Jason Stapleton is the one that has the same car. In addition to the lack of maturity (which should be obvious), there's also the fact that Stapel is "Drunken Master" in this movie. The plot is just not good. In it's self, it's just a silly film that's just about drunkenness, which is about 10 years old at the time of this film. It's just stupid.  The house party scene in the shower (where Stapelo and Stapford are showering together) is just dumb. The character development is horrible, and Jason St.apleton does his own version of "The Drunken Master."  The most important thing about the movie is that it is supposed to be an "American movie," not a "English one." It was good to see the drunkenness scene in "The Departed" (in "The World is Not Enough"). Jason Stappleton and Stacey Stapeland do the exact same scene in this. It was only the end of the movie, when Jason was making his own movie (a "Jackass" spoof), in which the characters are completely different.

The second movie wasn't too bad. The third was a little over the top and was about a year older.  The fourth was the fifth film, the same year it was. I think people remember that this one came out a year later.  This movie was supposed to be the last one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing about the movie is that it was directed by Stephen Freire. Freire directed the great 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon', which has many great action scenes. The great Freire doesn't make it through this movie.  I found it a very boring movie with nothing going for the acting.  The character of Zane is annoying, and when you compare it to other heroes like Zane, we are still at his age. He looks old for an action hero in general. I am surprised he looks more young than he looks old.  He just looks like a little boy, a child, a little man, or a man who hasn't changed his haircut or his style. His face is just the same as a child. I would like to see the best of Zanes face in the next movie, and I can't help but think of 'Titanic'.

The other shows that have been on CBS, and there's a good reason for that -- "The Big Bang Theory" was one of their hit shows, and the reason for doing it.  This is another bad show, with nothing to recommend it. I don't think they know anything about what they're doing. It's like they went to a real school and they came back for a second semester. It really takes up a lot of energy to do. The way they're all talking, I don'st think that anyone needs a real job in order to be in business.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, I'm a fan of Richard Matheson and this is a movie he made with William S. Morrow and when Mathesons "The Spy" was released in 1955 the movie was released on VHS tape in the US...and so on and so on. This movie is available in DVD and is a terrible mess and it needs to be restored with the VHS to be even remotely watchable. The only good thing is that there is the documentary on the "The Life of the Spy" DVD (which is about the life of Mathesonal Spy) that was released before this movie was, that should be compared to this movie. It's a pathetic excuse for a feature-length feature.

It was not terribly bad, I guess the movie was trying to be a straight-to-video movie and maybe they had some people there who hadn't seen the movie before and could say "Watching the movie is supposed to be like a high-school film with a PG rating. So let's just call it an "early film" for now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is atrocious and the ending is the only good thing. There is so much wrong that I don't know how it was able to be made into a movie that doesn't fall apart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the film, we see two very close friends--Minnie (played by Ann-Margret), who is about 5'2" or 5'3" and the 5'7" or about 5"8" Alice.  Alice is about 6"2" and weighs 150 pounds.  That's about 6 inches taller than Minnie, which is about 3 inches shorter than Alice. The next time they might do a "reality" show that has Alice and Minnie in the same place and they have the same height...  Alice's weight makes her seem like a little lady...  This is a movie for children, and you don't have to be a "nanny" type of film-maker to keep in mind the fact that the characters are supposed to be young.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that they won't make some good movies, or that they want to give us some new ideas, they're going to continue their tradition of "mockery" which is to say that "MOCKERY" is the word to use when it comes to the film being made. I am one who doesn't want to see myself in an ad campaign, with all that implies. (I've watched ads for other movies!) It has only been four days since the premiere, and it's already being compared to a "film noir" (which I have no idea what that means!). I was really really hoping that this would turn into a great documentary, about a real historical mystery, a real great film from all of these actors and storytellers. To see these actors playing their parts is just the opposite of being a film noir.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no idea what a horror film was. When my girlfriend and I went to see this, I was so confused when we saw the film that a horror movie was so much like a western remake of a film, or vice versa, the worst example of that is that the lead character, a woman, dresses like a man, wears makeup (her hair is a little redder, and her lips are rougher). There is no real reason for her to be a woman. The most amazing thing is the fact that she is beautiful. We are all women, and even the most beautiful woman could do that, because of the way she does her hair. The best part of her is the way her lips go down to the top of her nose, which is a beautiful face. She just doesn't have the courage to wear makeup and make herself look like a woman who looks like she comes from the west, and we are supposed to believe that she comes in the film looking like that. The acting is poor, and it doesn't make you feel scared. There are some really good moments, especially the scene where the woman is at home alone with her kids, and there are moments when the girl looks at a picture of a man or the man and says to her, "Look, he is handsome" that give the most "realistic" interpretation of a mother and daughter bonding over that bond. We see this with the boy and his father. The way he looks at the picture of his father and how he has just met him and his mom, you just feel like you are watching a very stereotypical American mother-daughter reunion, and the film ends there. I have a friend, who is a huge horror film fan, and I'm sure she has more knowledge about horror movies than I, and she is a real horror buff. Her opinion was that I had a different take on things, that this is a typical woman-child horror film, and that's how it turns out to be. It's not a movie you watch for the thrills, it's a movie that you want to watch for some horror. That's when you end up wanting to stay awake for, if not watch it with the kids or some friends, just to see if you have a better ending to this movie. I would recommend going to the theater or to rent the DVD, because the film is worth a 7 out of 10 or so, even if it wasn't for the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In that world where you can fly and move as if it were a puppet show I felt sorry for the "creatures" there. When I heard that they were actually making a film with these characters I was expecting a cheesy, silly little piece. The reason why I was there was to see them try something that would be quite dangerous. I mean if you could make the film and have them get blown off and fall off the back of a vehicle, or just in general go out into the real world. I'm surprised that they chose not to try it with a stuntman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just so terrible. You really don't care if you get out of this movie alive. This movie is so fake. The worst actor ever, and the worst script of any of my movies, so, I couldn't believe it. I couldn the whole movie. I could not even get involved in it was the worst movie I've ever had. And I could go on forever about it's terrible, awful and terrible acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie stars Christopher Walken (who plays in Walken vs. Walken) and Robert Blake, who plays Walken in the movie Walken VS. Blake, which was the original movie Walkens VS. Walkens, Walken is playing in this one as a big man. He doesn't seem to be as athletic as Walken was when he was a boxer.  Robert Blake is a much better boxer and he could be in a "Bigger" role in the film Walken Vs. Walkene (although he played Walken as an old man in the original film Walkens vs. Blake) I'm glad that there's a good chance that Walken could make a comeback in the future, and I'm hoping he gets a chance to get back in the ring or film a sequel.  Walken can't seem much more famous as an actor than he was, so I'm very happy he's still doing his best work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I can't say that my rating will go down to 20, I'm afraid that the movie is full of gore, like any horror movie that involves human beings...  The movie also doesn't fit for a PG-13 rating, it is a really weird horror film, so you never know what happens with it, and it doesn't seem like it would be scary, it's just weird... I liked watching the "The Ring" and I was really confused about this movie...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why my kids would allow it to be their movie, I think they probably just didn't like the movie. And who can blame them, when they know that it was made in 1972. I'm a film historian, and I've studied film for over 30 years, and this isn't a "documentary" it's a "film" and just about a year after the original "Truck Stop" film was released. I don' know how many times they changed their minds and changed the movie, or what it is that they were actually doing with this one, because I have never seen or read anything remotely close to the original film that would give the slightest indication that they had any knowledge of this subject matter whatsoever.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, the movie is about the history of New York. It has a great cast.  It is a really good movie--but when it comes to the historical stuff...the movie is really terrible. You can see the whole movie, from beginning to end--it is all true that you can find the actual historical stuff on the wall--it's about time-travel!  A historical "time-traveler" would have been very difficult for me to understand it in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts with a girl and then gets progressively stranger and stranger, with every frame. The movie doesn't contain the kind of "one way" of the other movies. The only positive comment that could be given is to say that it would be "dark" or something about the lack of light in this world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like it when i was in college at that point, it wasn't one of those things that made me dislike it at all when I was in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this film with an interest in the movie. I watched it on TV and the first thing I heard was the title, "ROSE DEVIL".  This film is a horror film about a serial killer. I don't want to go on and on about the title since that's one of the main themes of this film (and I don?t think there?s a film with more horror in it).  There were some great ideas for a horror version of Rose and I think that one could be put together here.  This is about the serial killer, who kills and is about to kill again. This film starts out, very good, with an innocent girl, who is going into her room to kill herself.  Rose De Ville plays the girl, so she?s not going into a room full of sleeping girls and killing them.  The guy is a serial murderer?s POV.  It's a really bad decision, not because of me, but because it will never get off the ground.  I was very impressed by the director of this movie, and the actors from the other two films.  He is an excellent actor and did an excellent job in this movie but this was a movie for me to see and to enjoy, and to see how it would go. So when the director sees the horror that this film tries to replicate, he should do it on the screen, not with his hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very excited to see this movie. It was an early 2000s release from a great distributor, "Warner" and the great "Warrior" director, Don Siegel, that was going to be released this year.    Don S-Ilein's film "The Legend of Bambi" (2001), "The Last Samurai", was released in 1994, and it was a true classic that was released on VHS with VHS tapes and that was about 10 years before this film was ever shown in the theaters.  That is not a coincidence. I'm not saying Siegel's film is superior to "The Lion King", just that it was being released in the summer. This is the first full-length feature I saw that was a truly original feature,butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbutt.butbutalthough the rest of the cast is decent,the director was apparently unaware of how to use a camera in this film. It's just as bad as I was expecting it to be,which is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of those movies about the stars who, in the end, just happened to be at the wrong place and time.  The film was about a few of the stars' lives.  This film was all about some of the people in this film, and who do you think would have been a good idea to put this film on? I'd like to see a movie about someone else's life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what happens when you cast a very good actor in a very small role. I have seen other people review this movie and they really didn't do much to be honest. Maybe I have some kind of weird bias in that regard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My film is very short (2 hours) and this film was directed by a guy named Michael O'Keeffe, who is the writer and director of the film.  I'm sure Michael OKeeff is very intelligent, I'm just very disappointed with Michael O. I mean it doesn't matter how intelligent you are, you should know the film by now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be about as good as a little kid's. Abut then, just like little kids, the kid comes along and he wants to get into the box. I did find that it would be best for this movie if the little kid was playing with the little toy on the floor. That way, the little boy would get into a box and go to school.  Oh well. That was about all that could be hoped for in the movie. You have to have your kid in front of the TV. There is no excuse for anyone to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to believe I'm one of those people who can go into a movie without a lot of experience, but it's hard to not find it hard to follow. If you don't find a really good reason to watch this, it's best to walk away from it and watch another movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film starts out with some sort of message of the original film. So I'm guessing this film will be about a guy in a black suit and a white hat preaching about some kind of "new religion" or some religion that will be a part of this film.  I've never really been interested in religion in any kind of film that is purely for entertainment purposes. To be honest, that's what the whole thing was all about.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this movie in the theatre. It was a very different film than it is today. It is almost like watching a new feature film, almost, and it's not bad. In fact, I was really pleasantly surprised by itbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbecausebutbutbuttbutbutthoughbutbutalthoughbutbutButbutbutexceptbutbutthebutbutitbutbutandbutbutuntilbutbutthatbutbutsobutbutenoughbutbutbeenbutbutnotbutbutyouknowbutbutthenbutbutwhenbutbutnoonebutbutmebutbutmyselfbutbutwasbutbutthanbutbutafterbutbutbeforebutbutbuttonbutbutunlessbutbutthismovie is still only about 70% complete and the director's next project will surely be more intense and ambitious than this. The other 30% of this movie will be about the making of this one feature film about the same old story. This is a documentary on a documentary subject, and although a very cool idea, and the film may be about a guy's journey to becoming a better person, it will certainly have its share of the old school "film-making" approach. As a result, it is almost an identical film to the one that I saw in 1999. It just was edited in the same format. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What really bothers me here, is the fact that this movie has only about a half hour of my life wasted. A movie in itself is about 90 minutes long, that is about 4 hours and 45 minutes of my precious life wasted in this movie.  The whole movie should not have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was in law school, I thought this movie was a comedy. I thought that if the movie was going to be made in a law school setting, it would go on campus, go to law school and spend a few days in my law office with a roommate and a law professor. I think that my movie was made on a campus in New York State, where there are about 20 or so law students, and that's where the real law school comedy would have gone on campus. The real comedy, in my opinion, would have been in a room with 2 law professors and their students discussing the movie. I know it would have required some serious writing skills. I am a native English speaker, not a native speaker of English. It's been translated, and I was taught at law school that in the real world people don't do what they do in a movie. This movie is a serious piece,but the characters are terrible. The acting is terrible. I wish people would take it seriously as a comedy or a piece about some kind of moral dilemma, like the movie that I've seen that was made about this film, which was about my real law students.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My guess was that this movie would be about the 'dying man'. My best friend and I are all grown men. I'm really not sure where this movie goes. I saw the last movie and it was a movie that was not really about the movie and that movie was about some kind of 'drama' in some way. I think the movie is trying to be a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like it when it was about my movie.  I find it difficult to figure out who the character is and how the movie plays out.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a film about the lives of young girls who are supposed to learn about things like love, sexual pleasure, body image, and what have you. The acting is amateurish at best, and all the "filler" is pretty much eliminated from this movie (which is the case with the first movie). There's not really any real plot to speak of, and the "heroes" are nothing more than characters in a love story, so the love story is completely different from the first one. I guess I have to live my life on that alone. I don't know how this movie got made or why I have been watching it so long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find it very hard to find a way to enjoy this movie... My Grade 10 English class made a movie a few years back about the life of Lord Moncrief. The movie was based on the life and exploits of an English teacher in a Canadian school...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horror movie for young people, and this movie is the same exact thing as the previous one, so what is wrong with that? It's hard to make a good case for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is very strange...the characters are so similar. What is the difference between them? They are not good. They were bad when they were teenagers. They had to grow up and change their personalities. So, why should they do it again? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in the early 80s (in 1974 when this movie was made) so I had a few more films to sit through with this one, and it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  But if you want to see some truly "extreme" film you might find something in this movie. It was made for a college audience, and some students who were at a junior college might have been the only ones who saw it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 30 seconds were OK, it was just about the movie, the actors were in the movie.  I'd just like to make sure that they were not in "The Movie" in the future. I find the whole thing ridiculous and so bad. It should never have been made. The actors have the same type of looks in the beginning of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm the one who said I liked the movie; because of the title, I thought the movie would be a little different. There is no question: It's an hour and a half of TV, one of the two or three times I've watched it on cable. The director knows exactly how to break us up and that is why, when I was watching it, I was really, really glad for it. But the movie is really awful; it's really bad in every way. The plot is so awful; there is not even a little bit of humor in it, and it's bad in all other aspects, and that's a complete waste of an hour of my life. It's a totally awful movie. I don't know how they even got a 10 out of ten. It really is awful, and worst than the worst of the horrible "Death Wish" movies. It has no redeeming value and, for me, is worse than a bad film, at all. What they try to do is insult, insult, and insult; even worse than the terrible "Citizen Kane". It is just awful. I'm not going to waste any more time on it, because they tried to make it seem more interesting; they made me hate it, it just made me want to scream for help, and in that regard it made me laugh, because it was ridiculous, so bad and pathetic.  I don´t think anyone should have to watch this movie. It was an insult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What could be the worst film ever would have been made worse, with a terrible script, poor performances and very poor directing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that they have a history of making movies and they can't be blamed for it because it's all movies - and movies don't come cheap or cheap ones - not just because they are going to go to the movies. I'm really not sure why it was so stupid or so illogical or what. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie was made for me and my wife and my friend and my son and my daughter. A friend of mine, who is an idiot in every way imaginable, actually paid a guy to do the editing of that film and when it was released on DVD, it was completely terrible and I was absolutely appalled by it. It was not worth even one of the five stars on IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the reviews, and was really curious how an "independent" film would fare at the time of this writing. I guess it is all about timing, and the timing of this film just happened to work out right when it did, but it didn't help that the lead actor, the one who was supposedly the best in the world at something else, was really bad in the movie. He was a mess, and didn't have a great presence or even a good idea of what he was doing with the lead-girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like movies that are entertaining, you will see this movie and find it to be boring and bad. There is no suspense, no real meaning, no sense of "realness", and no reason to watch. There's no hope in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed the old movies (1942, 1943) and would really love to revisit those films and I was surprised that even though I watched these movies years ago I hadn't heard of "Wrestlemania" (as a result of them being broadcast on television) and certainly I didn't think it was a big deal. These guys (who are billed as "The Greatest Tag Team of All Time") aren't exactly the greatest of wrestlers, and there is a little more footage for them to use as opposed to the shorter matches of the old films. The original tag team (as well as the original Triple Crown) had a more realistic look to the team, and had some good footage, as it was done in a studio, and they were at least in real life (at least they were from the 1940's), and so I would suggest you watch the old matches.  Some of the more recent guys (and not really the first time I saw these guys) don't really match up to the guys from the old days. They have a more athletic build and the old guys have a big head and big hair that go along with the look, and some are more muscle-bound as well. This makes the match look a bit too "manly", and to be honest, it doesn't really look like them because of them not having good conditioning. As a result, when they wrestle you will see them moving in the ring and you will get a much better idea of who they are.  I'm guessing the guys in the old video never trained with a lot of precision, and when they started training with the guys who were in the new video, they were pretty good at getting into the correct posture, so I think they'd have a better idea what the proper movement is for their movements. This is why they were so good in the classic films. This would have to do with the training methods of each of the guys.  The guys have their best matches in the first 40 minutes, where it's a match that isn't overly strenuous, and so the match isn't too badly affected by their movements and they are in the right places. I'd rather watch these guys at a place like the Great American Bash, which was an arena where they have a different style of match.  Also, as this is a new film they don't have any of the nostalgia factor of the original Tag Team, so that also made them a bit more difficult to figure
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is just a straight to video film. You could have probably made a decent film in this area at one time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original show was such an innocent and sweet show. With the kids and new cast and crew, they were trying to make fun of the kids, not the show. This show isn't for kids. They are going to get very bored and angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director claims that he wanted to make a film for the family who will be affected by this film, but if anything, his version is even less a true and complete film, and is a "poster" for the movie. What I mean is, you will see it on video at a "special" event, as if it were a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast are all British, which I guess was in part to help American actors get over a language barrier. In this film I'm trying to make sense of everything from the ridiculous "drama" which starts at the beginning, and is then dragged through the film, to the ridiculous and incoherent ending. If you've ever watched any film before, you'd be right at home, the only similarity being to the "horror" genre, which isn't a horror film of this type, but you really wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this film and the classic "The Omen", and I wouldn't recommend viewing this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The last film was a huge box set, but in the US it looks like they'll be releasing the DVD in the future, so hopefully I'll be able to rent or buy it at some point.  It's very depressing! And there's no point in watching or talking about this thing. I gave this review about the first one, which didn't make me cry because I knew it would get me to the point and hopefully some movie that was worth my time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's too bad that some people say it's "cheaper" than others, and I say it is too bad in comparison to "cheap". It was the same in the movie. I have no idea how they even got a rating like I gave them here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the movie version of "The Naked Gun" I got a DVD of this one, which was the naked gun version.  In this movie you really need to be able to watch naked because there's just way too much nudity. That's not to say that this movie didn't have nudity, the movie is just really badly put together. It's just like a really stupid movie that has a really bad script. I really hope I can at least get paid to watch it again because it was the only thing I could really get myself to watch for several weeks while I was working on the movie (that's how bad I felt watching it), and I couldn't really recommend it to anyone who was actually interested in watching this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was not so funny or thought provoking as I was expecting. In the end, you will have to go out to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't really have much of a storyline. I feel as though the director, like myself, has never been to any sort of acting class. I don't think it was meant to be a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, a few comments made it seem like there was a lot of mystery surrounding the movie. It seems they may have been watching the film in the summer.  Second, the movie was not intended to be a movie review. I did not know that this was going to be an independent film, nor did I know they would be promoting it in the same way, so I guess I can be more judgmental.  Third, I just thought the movie would be more like a horror film, and I have since found out there is a movie called "Lone Survivor," which features a lot more gore, and more extreme violence in it, that might explain some of the elements of the movie, and the movie that was released in the 90's and has more gore and a very "horror" feel.  So, if you look at the movie review you will find my comments about the elements being a little out of place in the movie as well as the lack of gore and extreme violence. It is hard to really describe how the movie goes from one extreme horror moment to another. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really the story of two people who are going to be married. It really isn't a marriage of two souls, or of two families, or a family, or two families in their entirety, at least not the two families depicted on the cover of the film. This is a sort of love story between two guys who are having sex, and it doesn't make sense to anyone. It makes sense to do a sequel to the original. I mean, if you see the last one, you will remember the movie was about a gay marriage and this film is about a lesbian marriage. That is the movie. The only way this movie can be made in the time and money that it's going to take is to do it again, and right now, that means for a sequel, or for a remake of the movie, and I would suggest that you get an independent film done in the next few years that tells this story. It's not a horrible, "gay film" that you'll be subjected to. I would just be very hard-pressed to recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not looking for the ultimate "outrage". The world needs a change. My time is better spent on this film,but the rest is the fault of someone else. The man who directed this film is an "old soul". His vision of the world has changed, and he is able to see, but he has not quite gotten used to the way that film-makers shoot this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was really about the story of how a good guy would act and how he would be able to get a girlfriend and win in the end.  The best part of the film was the beginning with the father and the father's father meeting up at a bar and discussing about how the father would go about getting his first girlfriend and how they would marry. I hope that they will consider going back and making this film. This movie could have been a great one because I really felt for the dad and wanted him to win and get what he wanted. I would have liked to see a film that could have gone with the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was made in the early 70s when my parents were married, and my mom and dad were happily married, so it would be difficult to say that they have never been together in love, it would have to be a very long time ago, and probably would have been very, very sad to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing I can recommend is to watch this movie if someone gave it to you at a certain point in time. I think it was like the last movie because it was really a tribute to the late Mr. Bannister, a friend of mine, and in that respect, I think they should be doing that to a tribute movie, not this piece of crap crap piece of celluloid they call an "amusement park". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to get angry about this movie. I think it's time to face the facts. A true fan of the show has seen this before and knows what to expect. We just don't have any idea what to do with the series of movies that were supposedly part of the "Trek Core" series. I can't recommend this series at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has been shown on the BBC and in the UK in the last several years. This is the first time it has been released anywhere. There are some really good documentaries about the history of the Indian subcontinent such as: Kashmir, Kargil, Goondiye Khil or Chhatra. A few years ago, BBC did a history programme on Kashmir, and they produced an epic on the history and development of Kashmir and other documentaries about various parts of the subcontr.   I have watched the movie, and the film itself is not the best. We do get some really interesting and powerful perspectives in the history documentary, in the form of the historical dramas or interviews with different people such as the British and other Indians from the Indian National Congress. I think these interviews are available in the film, in Hindi or Devanagari, in addition to Hindi subtitles. It is the same for Devadip.  Also, we get to see the famous Chhatri's scenes from the movie. I like seeing some of the scenes from Chhatrri in his films, and this one does feature him in it, I think.  There are others who are in this movie who are very famous and such as Anand Tiwari and R.D. Burman, for instance. I'd like to see them in the movie as well, especially Chhatrik or Devikonda, who is a pretty famous and well-known Indian actress, and are present in the original film, and do have some more scenes with the two main characters in this version. I don't think we are given their scenes from this version of the movie due to some technicalities. I have also been told that Chhatris scenes are available and they are shot. Chhatrak has shot a few of his scenes for the documentary, too. I wish these directors would look into the historical events that the Indian soldiers were fighting in such as "Lok Samachar", "Tughlaq ki Hukra", etc, and then see the scenes shot in "Lahore", "Laojung" and "Gaya", because these are the scenes of actual war. Chhaya Khatri, a pretty beautiful Indian actress whom the filmmakers chose to work in the Hindi version of their film, plays the part of a peasant woman. I hope this movie was well-received by the historians and the other people involved in the making
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what happens to bad movies... or bad films... or maybe bad art... or BAD movie.  It's not just bad actors either... The movie is filled with awful acting and the whole thing just doesn't make sense.  This film is just like any other bad movie with a stupid plot, awful cinematography and bad acting... If I wanted to spend my time watching this crap, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To me, it's just a bad thriller with a plot, dialogue, and acting. I think I saw it in the theater at the start of the movie. I saw this one, I'll admit, a little bit before the end of my vacation, because I wanted to see the final version of this movie, in which it was going to be filmed, and I saw a scene of that movie before it had been released. I thought that, at the time, they might just have done a little re-edit for the film (not as a horror film). This is a true horror film,butbut but still, the "last straw" has finally come, and the filmmakers should not allow themselves to put this one out, because if you liked "A Moment of Silence", you might want to see it again (with "The Last House on the Left").

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found the movie interesting as an historical study. In fact, I have a copy of a movie that was released about a decade ago that deals with this topic, and I bought the DVD, DVD+VHS combo of this film. As soon as I saw it in the theatre, I was left baffled, and there's no real reason for that to be the case. The director could not really be bothered to figure out a way to create a believable world around the cast. It was obvious that the director made the film to make the movie go fast, and with that in mind, there's not much to talk about, and honestly I would have made this film a comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that the original movie was so bad. The only reason the original film didn't get such a negative rating is because the original was a B movie. This movie was the B movie, with no real hope of redemption, unless I would go to another country.  I had a friend ask about the plot in a review, and was told that the film was just a bit sad, with some tragic loss of innocence and the typical love affair with a girl. I mean, do you remember how the original "Lassie Come Home" was about the kid, and how in it, the child was just running from the government, to get his mother? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of a man who has a very serious addiction is not an obvious one.  If the film is to be called a true story, then there will be some great actors out there and I think that they could do a really good job as they are very well versed in movies and can bring this movie together. Unfortunately, that's what I've seen before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad. I didn't understand it, why the director decided to be so stupid and so mean, as if he was trying to prove that this movie was actually good. I'm not one of those stupid people, so maybe he wanted to prove a point, that this film is really good. Maybe he really thought that people would appreciate this movie. If so, then he really had his back to the wall with me. I think that people like myself, who read his first two short stories (one of them was good enough, just the first two) will be disappointed. And if people really do like this movie, the people should know that it should be released in a very short time. I hope that there are still some people who liked this movie and that they see this movie before the big-scale release. This movie is just a little comedy that tries to make people like it. A lot of people will just like it, if people just don't know the first time they see it. I would hate to see it in a theater, as it was a very stupid comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not one for violence, so if anyone out there wants to take part in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know, I just found out about it today and I was already really frustrated with the movie (see this website's reviews) but I did enjoy some of the actors in this movie (but the whole movie was shot in London - so it was really shot in the English countryside). I was hoping for some footage of it raining in the countryside.  The director had an English accent.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It took awhile before I understood it and after all of that time, I can understand how they are trying to teach it to everyone else. As for me, I've been involved in all the major film festivals, I know the festival crowd, so to speak, I just saw a bunch of people sitting on their hands, I don't know why they would think I'm so dumb or they just don't care. This is the second time I've seen a festival screening of this movie and it's not about an interesting film. If I ever made a comment on one of the other films of the festival, I'd tell them that I can't be sure of the actual date because I got an offer to go see this one (which happened on July 9th) and it didn't get a 1/10 from anyone who I had gone with. It was simply bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days ago, there was some speculation that this film might be called "Giant Man Returns," and some of my friends and other fans of the original Giant Man were very disappointed, so I thought, "What better way to go than the original." This film is definitely a different film from the one in the comics, and I think that's something I'll explore more down the road. There's even a character with a similar name that is in the comic who doesn't even appear in this one.  This is a very bad film, and one that I would recommend NOT to see if you have a small amount of time on your hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping to have a few friends over and hang out. I really didn't enjoy the movie at all, to be honest. To be honest, this movie is probably the worst movie of my entire life. This movie was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, there are some actors who have worked in this genre for many years, and have worked with various directors. I was a fan of Paul Lukas, who made his first movie, and it would have been very easy for me to watch the movie and then write an objective review about how good the movie was.  Paul Lukis was not the director of this movie. He worked with a writer who had written "Blow-Up Man" (the first movie), he had his hands in the entire script, and he was the director, not the producer. The writer was a major liability in this movie, with some characters speaking with such little dialogue, it is painful to watch this movie without any real entertainment value. If I want to laugh, I have to watch Paul Lukases movies, which are funny, or at least mildly entertaining (the "Blows Up Man"). The same goes for some other actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend, who is a TV actor, is currently being filmed as this film's lead. It's hard to imagine that someone is being well treated by this cast. I will say this, as someone who is actually from New Jersey, I was very naive about this whole thing. I had no idea it would have taken this long to finish this film. That's not to say there haven't been a few people who have done very hard and long and are of very good character. I am sure there are actors who are extremely skilled in their craft, who have great lives and could probably make a film with the most limited budget. I could not believe this was a film I actually wanted to see. I hope I never have to make it to see it again. I would suggest you see this film, if you are a fan of the first film. If you have no idea what I'm talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my 10th movie in a row to see this movie, and I'm still reeling from it.   In my defense, this is not meant to be as entertaining as other movies. It is a study, and a serious study on the topics it talks about. As such, the acting is subpar, bad acting is what it is.  The dialogue itself is just awful. I would not recommend it to the general public.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so dumb it's really funny at other times. It does have some funny moments and there's a lot of slapstick in the movie, so you're stuck with that, even though I know they won't be able to use any actual slappers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did like one of the "Theatrical" versions of the movie--that is, a version which came out about a month before and which could be expected to be filled with a group of Hollywood "stars" such as Kevin Costner and Kevin Kline--that was not going to be the case for this film--at least the "theatrical version" which is still out there--with a "film-only" DVD. If you get a chance to go and see it--and if you liked "The Cat People" DVD release--you'll understand why I'm upset with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is a former screenwriter of "Saturday Night Live." He's now in the same category as "Saturday Morning" or the like. The other actor on the set is an American actor (Ron Moody) who, as Ron Moody, has directed several "Saturday Evening" TV series. His character was a stand-in for a very good American stand-up comedian who was in town at the time of the shoot.  This Is A Horrible Comedy, and it is my opinion that it isn't funny, which is only a matter of time before it becomes funny. The film is boring, and is, on my taste, probably too long for the 90 minutes of the film that I'm going to make it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who's been involved in this process, this is what happens, in fact. It's the result of a complicated, time-consuming process that has been dragging along for a long time. I'm a veteran at this. It is something that I can watch a movie about, even if you've never really followed it up. I think it's important to point out the fact that this movie has no real name and I'm not sure what its supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I like about movies is that they get bigger as they get older. This is a big-budget film, I was hoping for a bit more intimate movie about it or at least something with good acting and some good story. The story wasbutbutbutbecause the director made the movie and the writer had to make the movie, then the story took a while and was not all that good, I thought the movie got a bit scary with the monster in the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it weird to laugh, and not to laugh.  I had never heard of this film before (and as far as I knew, it had to do with the film industry). I had no idea how this would end up. This film is an American feature-length film. It was not edited in the way that American films are made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with one of the three leads of the film playing out an old Western. They have a character named "Bill" (actually Bill Morgan who's been dead for 30 years), and is directed by another man named Joseph L.   It doesn't make sense to the characters because you can't get a proper read of their mindset. I'm a huge John Wayne fan, I really wanted to see John Wayne's "SAS." He's one of my favorite actors and knew what I was going to see, I went to see what was on the video when I went back to the video rental place, and I'm not going to buy a rental copy of the movie for 30 minutes, I don't know what would happen to the movie if I watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of the old "Stargate" series, and I really wanted to go see this one, so I was really disappointed, the show was awful, horrible, horrible (sorry for the actors, because I couldn't believe how bad it was). I had to keep watching until the end, and if it wasn't for the "Starcow", I would be ashamed. How could I get over it was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie, I was expecting it to be about a very good American comedy like The Producers and the Comedians' Club (which is in fact the only true comedy that is made by the Producers), a comedy that would come out of Hollywood in 2003-2004. If you are a true Hollywood actor, you'll want to leave this movie in the theater for a couple of hours and see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of other films, and I've even seen some of the actors, and at this point, I'm still sitting here, waiting for something good. The truth is that this is the most expensive film that I've ever seen, and it's certainly a great deal of work, and when you factor in the time it took to complete, and the quality of some of these films is much higher than this. However, a great film is not made out of a few of these "extra" scenes.  I'm sure it's the end result of trying to make a few extra bucks here and there. I hope, with this film, that it will have the chance to be truly finished and look great, because that would be really great.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen The Avengers which is really an all-star cast of the Avengers - I have also seen more of the cast in the past few weeks - this was not a surprise to me. The only thing I could say was that there were some of the older cast members - they didn't seem quite as old as I expected when they came to my house - and they were playing around in the world of The Avengers.  It's really hard to judge how much The Avengers influenced this film - it has so much influence, and how they're so influential in that world of ours.butbutbutBUTbutbutI do know that that world isbutbutyetbutthey do exist - they dobutbuttheybutbutandbutbutnotthat'sthethingthathappenedinTheWorldOfTheAgentsOfSallybutbutithasbutthematterhowtheyplayinTheAgriculturbutso i guess I should have been a little more open with the characters and actors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've ever been a victim, you will be familiar with this movie, it was the one which was the subject of my victim's case, it will be your same kind of film.but the difference here is that now the movie is being made to support the idea that it was a good movie that I was raped in, the victim's name and picture are used as a pawn to get attention and raise funds. To the contrary, this movie has no respect for the victims or the survivor, and even takes a stab at them. If you are the type that has ever been raped, or have ever lost a friend or loved one, you would realize how incredibly inappropriate this movie is. To be even more explicit, the movie has nothing to do with the "survivor's" point of view. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was at the Sundance Film Festival, where it was a "drama" with Richard Grieco and the cast of A Thousand Acres and was not a comedy. They had me laughing hystericallybut when it came time to get it together, they had me so wrapped upbut too late.  They are so bad actors, pathetic. I wish I would of stayed home from this movie. If you get a chance to see this, don't see it at Sundance, don`t see it, it's one of the worst movies you'll ever see. I`m an ardent movie buff, I like my actors, and I would like to do a remake of A thousand Acres. They don`T look like a movie, they look like something else. It`s one of a kind, it`s so bad. It has to be one of this decade`s worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about what the script says, i don't really know what's going on in it. It just happens that I saw this movie at the San Francisco International Film Festival. It is a lot of work and money to make a movie that costs only around 5 million. So maybe someone who's willing to throw money at it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horror movie.  The movie doesn't try to be scary, doesn't scare you, and doesn't even scare the camera crew at all (you can see it in some of the pictures posted here). The acting is completely amateur and amateurish, and completely amateurish with actors that don't even try to hold the camera.  I was so depressed watching this movie for a while... And, believe me, it's one of the worst horror movies ever...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched a great documentary that just came out in the US. It was shot in a wonderful New York City. This film was shot on a really beautiful California beach,but the people of California seem to have the upper hand when it comes to the movies. They don't seem to be treated as a separate species. They are treated like the average Hollywood-dude, which means they're "heroes", and are treated as such, but only in a few shots, and are usually shown with their backs to the camera. I'm not sure why they were treated as something different from all the rest when the filmmakers were there to see them, and just seemed to be just the typical guy-guy thing...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my first time seeing this particular film, I am hoping it is only my first. I just got back from a movie in the Midwest, and I'm fairly certain they had an old release of this one! I'm sure I'm going to be asking myself "What is going on right now with this movie?" I'm glad that they're making movies that they have a hope of making a buck. So far I don't think I've heard of the last one. What's worse, is that, like the first one, it just sucks. This is a movie that just got off the ground because there are two people in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film had a little bit of a mystery, that would involve a lot of time spent in a castle in the Middle East. Now that this film was first released in Japan and in Europe, it had all the trappings of being a mystery to people outside the world of Japanese cinema. That is not only true for English speaking people but to Japanese viewers, who are very used to watching movies with nothing but very brief, or none, "what on earth is happening?" That's a film worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Pioneers" are described in a few movies, they're portrayed here as "pioneer kids" or "pilgwin kids"  They're pretty big kids and they don't look like they have had much in the way of training, which makes them look like wimpy human athletes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it was the director who chose to see the movie with no real expectation of a success. I have been a long-time member of the SCC and I know that in this movie, it would be best if someone was to help me make sense of the story. In order to be able to understand the story, I guess this would be the best time to see it.  IbutbutbutBUTbutbutyet. IbutBUTBUTbutBUTyet! But that doesn't matter. The movie didn't take any real interest, and the acting was as bad as the premise. I don't even know how a director can be praised as the only actor to be nominated for a SCC Best Picture in 25 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love 'Kirika' and I would never have any doubts that the person who directed 'Kiri' is a 'Kiris' fan, so I didn't care that much about it. The reason I watched this is because I needed to understand what Kirika was going through and what she thought about the situation. And I'm surprised I missed this as, as a viewer, you don't need to be Kirika's mother to understand and comprehend it. What's really sad about it, is that Kirika is just a young girl in 'Kiro' and the situation that she has to face is much more serious. I do believe there was an episode dedicated to this, in the third season of 'Kuroko no Basuke', about the tragic events surrounding her life in Kirika, but she's now 10 and a bit, so it's hard to relate to Kirika. It's a pity that she could relate to the characters in her 'Mighty Kirika', so I guess that the producers didn't really want to show the real story. In a way, it's a bit of a cliché, that 'The Movie' was like a 'The movie' of Kirika and that the whole story is about her and how she grows up.  Well, I can understand this for the producers and producers, who want to focus on what they have created. The movie doesn't seem to be too serious either. Kirika doesn't have much time to think or just cry. She's an innocent child and I don't know what happened to her to start crying in the movie, to begin thinking about her life. Kirik and I have discussed this a bit in 'What did Kirika do in her youth', and the scene where she went to live with her father, so you know how she is treated, so to see her grow up as an adult in 'The movies' just seems unnatural. It didn't happen in 'Shiki', and if I remember correctly, the parents were already very happy in 'Millionaire Kirika'. That scene was about Kirika becoming a spoiled girl in that very short period of time.  (The movie 'Mortal Sitter' was more realistic, as her life was a bit shorter, but Kirika did have a happier childhood than 'Mille)  This is a pretty major flaw.  The whole reason that Kirik joined the police force, was because he didn't want to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off with an intriguing premise. A gay man who, we are told, was a very close friend and lover of the "father" and has been out with him at some point. "My Father" was a gay man. "Burt" was obviously a straight man and it is not hard to see that he was one, and we are supposed to believe that they both would be close friends and lovers. The movie opens with a fairly good, if totally false premise. It is not a movie about two gay men meeting and falling in love for each other. We are told that "my father" is a homosexual. It was made for the same reason that other films have made about gay men "coming out" and making "coming-out" movies and is a film about two men who were close friends, and not "gay-romps" and that's all I got out of the movie.  The film goes straight to the topic of how two guys would have sex with each other, and it's going straight to where "B" is coming out, and I will give it the benefit of the doubt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In one respect I have no hesitation in saying that people need to do their research. I had already seen it at a college campus in the US, and this is the film that was released on the same day it hit the UK, the DVD cover was actually for the US. It wasn't until about two weeks later, on my way home from work, that I finally got my hands on a copy of the UK edition. That's the reason why I am writing about this film now. I am angry and depressed. I have an idea of what it's like to have done it, but I haven't done it yet. It is an utterly depressing film, and I have seen worse. In the US we have the "fame" of the "Giant Bombing" film and the "T-Bombing" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you see the reviews, you know that when you go see this movie, you're in for an emotional roller coaster. I hope my son enjoyed watching "The Cat Returns" because, for me, watching this movie would have made me cry and not laugh. This movie has absolutely no plot, has terrible acting and the film ends in what I have to assume is a very, very bad conclusion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The original show had two characters and the other was a very annoying jerk who would act like a little kid. This guy doesn't seem to have any talent at all and really isn't funny at all. If the guy is even the slightest bit funny and tries to act silly in a silly way, I don't think there's any hope that he ever becomes a hero in this show. It is just silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I could have been objective about this movie, I would have ranked it at the lower end of the scale, probably just on the IMDb, where I have to say that I would rank it high in the case of my peers in the horror genre who have the "scary eyes" and would rather watch a film that would be based on a character with real eyes and would be rated for a movie that has more blood and guts (in the case I actually saw) than this, because I really thought it could be good. I thought it would be about a boy's life in the process of being turned into a monster and his struggles with the killer and his journey from his "evil" self to "good" self.  This movie is about a lot of gore and little character development. You may or may not be able to guess, at first or second watch, why this film didn't work out with its distributor. The film is the most confusing film of any of my five "scare house" films. It's an extremely dumb movie that should have been banned from all theatrical release, and not be viewed by anyone at all.  The best way to describe this film would be an episode of "Dragnet" or "Murder She Wrote." This movie was so bad that it had to be "re-discovered."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a terrible movie.  I hope that the producers will show the truth about this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, in general. I was a student, and I was studying the philosophy of philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin. I think my degree is in English, I think it was in the history of English or the history and literature of English. I didn't mind the idea of English classes or the idea that they might teach English to the natives in Hawaii, so if they wanted to. Well, I wasn't in the habit of paying attention to movies from the late seventies and early eighties, I just happened to watch this one and was trying to see if the people in the movies were related to me, and it turns out I was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I did watch this movie was to review my memories of it's previous release. I found it on DVD in 2010 at the IMBD library in Philadelphia, which was a nice surprise (though I must admit, a "good" surprise). The film is a "re-presented" version of the first movie, and so, it's not nearly the quality it's predecessor.  I also found the "goodies" that were used to distract me from watching this movie at the airport, the same goodies used to get me through the film, on the plane.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a fan of the first film, when it was the first, and it was my first love and it still was a film, not just a documentary. This is the second time I've seen this film, and for me to say that it is a "documentary" would be like saying the first one was a true story would be a joke. I don't think they have the rights to this. The first time around, I think they just gave me the title and gave it to me. I didn't really understand that it was a documentary until I saw the second "documentation".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most stupid film ever. I think I saw a better film in the 70s called "Space Ace". In this one I didn't even bother watching it and wasted about two hours of my life on it. The end result is that this has to be one of the worst movies ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really, really wanted to go see this film again after seeing it at The San Francisco Independent Film Festival. The film is released on the same day as The Big Sur, about 20 miles away from Big Sur.  This film is not really good, and is certainly not "B" rated. This film was made to be a true portrait of Big Sur and not a cheesy documentary or "D" rated film. In this movie it doesn't show off the Big Sur scenery that well, there is a lot of "film" or stills of the Big Surf, and I think it was a poor decision to make a film that is trying to reach an audience that is out in the Big Beaches at the time (the beachcombing scene, which is just beautiful.) I'm not sure what they were thinking when they made this film (or how they got the camera, it wasn't as good). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was originally scheduled for release on July 24, 2003 and was slated to star Chris Tucker. The film, when it comes out, will be released in Japan on July 22, 2003.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, let's be frank here. I've never actually heard of the movie before, and it's not a bad one at all.butbutbut the film was not made on the very low budget that the book had been made, and when it comes to editing it's been called out for this very reason. We're not dealing with an old-fashioned silent film like an A-grade silent film or something. I am not one to say that the editing was bad, and I am no A-movie editor myself. As I have no idea of what we're dealing with here, I really can't recommend this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed. I didn't think about the whole thing because of the time I was in the cinema. The end result was not worth the $5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got a good feeling about this movie, about some one who was going to be the director of "The Way We Were". I was hoping that at some point the director would say, "OK, I've done this movie twice now, and it's going to end my career with this" and give up, and would be the most naive director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to be able to do it justice. I don't have the desire to go to the theatre to see this movie. The actors were horrible. I was just laughing when I saw the opening scene. I got really angry at myself, and couldn't even concentrate for the first 30 seconds. The ending was the same way I could watch it with my friends. I wanted to cry. It made me laugh again! If you're gonna watch this movie, you need to see it in the theatre with a live actor, a live audience, or I'll give this one to the world of you and not just a bunch of strangers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a writer. I have never written anything. I would never have the guts to do it in the same way that this movie did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just another terrible piece of trash, just like the previous movie.  This movie should never be made in any form, ever, even to be watched on TV. I think it should be pulled off the shelves, unless this writer and director are all so high that they can take a break from this movie. If you haven't seen the other movie, do yourself a favor and see it before you go buy this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In general, if you see something else, like a horror flick, you're better off.  As a result, I didn't really get involved. This movie, in addition to being shot in Mexico, is supposed to be a film about the Mexican people, so it should shed some light on it.   The only time I saw the woman in her underwear (when she was doing the dance) was when we were supposed to watch the film for her role in the dance, and I'm very comfortable saying that I would have to go to Mexico to find out what she looked like in her undies. I don't want to make it seem like it was all that bad, as I was, I just thought that, to go into Mexico with this movie and try to understand it, would be interesting, since I've seen the film before. I do feel that they should have shown me what exactly would be covered by this film. In addition to the obvious reasons of not showing myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I'm honest I was in a trance when I went in, and I thought I knew this movie inside out. It's a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really had high hopes for the movie.  In the meantime, the people who run this film have a degree from the film school. They have no film directing credits (I don't know how much money they have made in years), they've been at the film house for a year, they've directed one short, and they've had their picture in the film for two days (the director says they had a good life). They're not a seasoned director, and the way they treat their characters is really horrible, as I've mentioned.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like watching the first half of a great movie--the only thing that really changes is the color of the screen, and that's enough for me to consider this movie the definitive "megan-movie"--but I'm left to comment on whether or not I've achieved the impossible. My husband is a big fan of the first season, and if you saw the first episode, he and I are not in his opinion the nicest couple in the world, or that he has any animosity towards it--in fact, he's not even all that much older. My daughter (and her husband) had a great time watching the show, and the idea of doing it again seemed great--it's hard for me, myself, to watch this film, which was actually quite good--I felt like I was watching "Mad Men"--the same way that "Mad" did it--and I was enjoying it at times.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Myself, a friend of mine, and our three kids were out to see this film in the New York area. I have no idea why the kids (or myself) would rent this film. And to top it off, I couldn't tell you who this film is meant to be about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that has no real reason to exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it was because it was a small indie film and it was just released, and because it has been released on video, I found out that this movie wasn't even released, although it was in theaters, because it's still out of print.  I mean, what do they do with this thing? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a very slow paced movie. I'm not an idiot, I like fast paced movies. I'll give it a shot to see how it ends up.  I had to watch the entire movie on video for this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've never been so afraid. There's a good reason for it. The acting sucks. The special effects are OK. I'm sure I'll be able to do something with a computer or something like that.  I won't give this movie a score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on the novel "The Girl Who Took a Bullet" written by Stephen King. I thought that maybe someone would go out and make a movie based on this novel. If you don't remember the book, it was based on a girl in a small town in Maine and it was about a killer named "Jack", a killer that is similar to Jack the Ripper. It is obvious that the movie is made for people who want to see Stephen King's film "The Shining", because it is based upon the novel, and if you are not an "Sleeping Beauties" fan, you are going to get a really bad view of this movie.  I have to say that there is a lot of people that love to read and see this movie and that makes me think this movie was the subject matter of this review, and I have my friends who are "big" movie fans who say that the book was so wonderful. The movie is absolutely terrible, the acting is awful. It might just be that I didn't have the opportunity to sit in a theater, because the movie was made to be seen on television, as I think it should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why I'm wasting my time on this. It's just as bad as the first one, and worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well first, I must admit that I enjoyed this movie since i saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. I am pretty good at being a critic.   I did not have a lot of time and, like a lot, I was not on a boat with my family.  I knew all of the actors in this film, even those on their way to the Toronto film festival. i knew them better than any one on land. The people that did not get their money back (myself included) got their money, so I thought it would be a good time to go watch this movie, since my dad liked it when it came out in Toronto.  Now, my dad doesn't mind this type of movie because he likes to sit in a theatre, and I think most of us would have liked to have the same movie we loved and pay a couple more bucks for. That's why it's on DVD and not on cable.  The Toronto film was $13.95, the Toronto video is $7.97, and my movie is $8.97.  And so, even though I liked the movie, I had to change it and do my best to keep the story straight because there is only one movie out there with the same story. There is a whole bunch of movies with a story about the other people of the island and there is this island, and there are all these people and this island has to be different. My family went with some good friends to a film festival in Canada and I was with them and some of them had their own personal experiences with the island. And they are very knowledgeable about the situation so I was very glad to hear all about their opinions and their thoughts about the island before we made the decision to go to this island.  So, since I knew that there was only one island and one story, I knew we would have to stick to those opinions and the opinions of my friends. And we did that and so we made some good choices.  However, as far as the island itself, if you are new to the island or have never seen it, or if you know your island like mine does, you will never understand the "what-the-heck-is-going-on" of this movie. The island has been in the news since last week, and that's all it was for.  My husband and I, who have only seen the island in photos or video, had no clue

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I am not complaining because I don't think that's really a Hollywood movie to complain about. Secondly, I don' think that this is about the last time the actors make a movie for a long time. If this was about the first time, they would have probably gone to the second feature, which is about a thousand dollars short of a thousand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is very simple. It has no real depth.  The music is good enough and the movie had the same producer for most of its life - but this is it. The quality of this film is below that of the "good" film. I really felt compelled to write a negative reviews review about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about a man who was going to visit this woman at her hotel. The hotel, because of the hotel's location and its history, is an historic hotel. And so, the woman's character is just, in general, an "actor" in this movie. So, her acting style is so different. She seems to have more of an American accent. She looks like she comes from around the country. She speaks in a very different way. I've just seen this movie on DVD.  You'll never know what is in her mind or what is going on in her head. She's very confused about what she's supposed to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not just a movie. I went to the theater at the end of the day and it was really hard to enjoy this movie. It was so horrible. I couldn't even look at this movie as a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect this to be a serious study of religion, I don't think anyone reading this was expecting a serious religious film. The actors play their roles as though they've been given some script advice from an actor's college course.

So we know that they had plenty of money to work with. The actors were excellent,butbutalthoughbutbuttheir budget didn't allow them to film a movie that was in the style of the other movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I went to the theater, because we were really looking for a movie that would make us laugh (for her). After going through the first half hour of "Empire Strikes Back", we were truly amazed at just how bad "Empires" is. I'd even say that it's the worst movie ever made!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst film I've ever seen but there's absolutely no explanation for why. My first thought was that it would be a low budget film and a low movie would be made. But this is probably a low level, a real low level.  I'd really encourage you to take a look at this film, a movie that would be released on DVD, and the director would have some answers. There is no good reason to rent this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched hundreds of movies in the last couple of years, so it wasn't that bad. I mean, this was definitely a one-time thing, like when people see a film in the theater, and it's a low budget, a horror film with a poor production values, and for the rest of my life I'm going to avoid this movie, I don't think it's worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie doesn't even contain a single person you can recognize.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you go on the IMDb movie guide (http://imdb.com/title/movie-series-to-movie-title), you can find about 30 movies that I did not rate on IMDb. (I'm looking at IMDb's most recent film on IMDB). Most movies that are released on DVD are rated PG-13, and even then, I'd say at least 90% of them are PG-rated, and most of them have some kind of special rating by the MPAA.  The DVD-release of this movie is rated PG and they should really be given a warning to people who may enjoy it. I think you'll find it's not worth the movie, especially if you have any money to spare.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To start off with, I was hoping that the movie would be on DVD that I would have been given a coupon or something for, or that it would have a decent rating on IMDb. I was pretty shocked that a good portion of the IMDb community (at least the people who rated the movie with 7.5/10) rated the film with 9/10.  After all this is a movie that should have been released at least three years ago, and it's about time it got an official release, so I don't know what IMDb would have to do to justify recommending this one, especially for the price of admission. The only good thing about this film is that it was shot on location in Australia and the movie itself is about to come out on VHS, so if you happen to see it, you can check it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so shocked by this film. It's not a movie that you can watch to learn anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to make it into an analysis. I really want to keep my opinions to myself and just tell you that I do understand that this movie had the chance to be made by a big name company that had been able to capitalize on the "L" word.  There's a little bit of the big Hollywood players making appearances here and there.  And this is the one that I see in the theater.  I like the idea behind this movie but this is an independent movie with a bunch of nobodies and a bunch more nobodies than you're going to be able to make a movie about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As an American movie fanatic, I've seen American movies over 100 movies. I've lived in the US for almost 30 years. I have nothing but respect for the American film industry. But this was a bad film at all, and I'm sure it was a pretty good idea to make it, in the way to make a low budget movie about an Italian film to try and bring a sense of the movie to a young Italian actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I did was read the book...I was looking for a great film about a great actor and director...I knew what a great book it was...I loved it...I can't imagine what this movie is about, let alone what I had for the last hour or so.  The reason I am writing this is because I want to avoid being the only person who gets this movie. I feel like I am wasting my time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie was supposed to be about a man and his relationship with a woman.    In that case, "The Man Who Wasn't In It" is the man's story and it's about his loneliness and his inability to talk to anyone. I would say he's the main character of this movie,but he's not terribly happy and doesn't get along with others, mainly because he was alone and scared at the beginning of the movie. I know what he needs to do, and I'll do my best to do something for him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit that it's not really my place to criticize the acting. I think this movie is going to be reviewed pretty highly because it is a great action moviebutbutitbutnot with an "A" rating from one of the other reviewers here. In the past, I have done several movies for the genre (including "The Godfather", "Rocky", and "The Matrix").  It's got to be more "adult" and mature.  The problem is, because of the violence it seems like it's going to go over the top, and I don't think they want it to do that. This movie is "T"-rated, which is supposed to be an adult film with no nudity, and the violence is going from every direction, and they didn't go to the trouble of making a real budget, and at first the violence would seem too graphic for the whole movie. In fact, the violence was so graphic in the first two movies, which was more of a thrill-ride for the audience, and this is going all over the world in the States and all over, which they weren't able to keep on film, and that leads to some people who aren't so sensitive. And I don . If you're an action-movie fanatic, the first movies were designed to be fun.   It takes a real commitment to your characters to be "tough" and gritty, because otherwise you might lose the audience. I'm afraid the second time around that they were going to have a "small" budget they couldn't afford to take care of everything that they would have had to worry about, and after all this time, they didn t have to do the second shoot, and it wasn't that late in the production. The budget was better. I have my doubts if the action would have been that gritty, or if the violence might have been more realistic, as well.  In the meantime, it might have looked really great, with a great cast (especially the leads) and tons of gore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's most shocking about the film is that the director, Steve McQueen, has an Oscar nomination.  This film was shot in the early 1980's, and was released in 1988 on VHS video. That's a long time for any VHS distributor to release a feature-length movie! It's really sad that a feature film that was so good, like Bullitt is released in such poor condition. The film is like an early 90's VHS. The effects are bad. A bunch of people working on the film were really good artists, and I'm guessing they got hired because they were great at this. There are just some guys doing Viggo Mortensen and John Huston, and that's it. The guys who are working on this movie are all pretty much unknown, which really doesn't help matters. I also thought the film was a bit boring in the end, so, to keep things interesting, I thought it would end up being just really depressing or something like that. This is the sort of movie that, if you had some people in it, would really make you depressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about as good as any of the other films out there, but it has a bunch of actors from the UK, including a few British actors. They are English speaking and not native English speakers who, in my opinion, should be the main actors in the film. The two leads are the main ones, in England, in the UK.  It would be nice to cast some of them and get a proper break, because I really like and enjoy them.  If you want to see them, check out some of the Britney Spears videos, because these two leads were both in one of those videos.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was in black and white when it was first released. And in color when it won at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002, and this movie won the Venice Film Festival and I'd like to say that was an award for an outstanding work of art and this one was considered, at best, a flop. The movie wasn't even half finished by the time it was released. The film is just terrible in every way. I was absolutely amazed when I saw the credits for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Invisible Ray" is a film about a young, attractive and good-looking boy who lives in a remote desert (as it was the film's intended) who gets picked on and is seen in a few still photographs. This is a totally inappropriate film that should never have been released, at the very least should be withdrawn from circulation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a real rip-roarer. I really don't know what happened to the guy who made "Shallow Grave". It's a real shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie, I thought that it was going to be a spoof of some of the most ridiculous movie stars and most outrageous movie plots. This is the sequel to "Holes Holes". The main character is a cop, and that makes no difference. The main role in "Hole Holes" was a "Hollywood" cop, who could have had the cop character wear a uniform and have been "Hollyweed"-ed up and gotten a big paycheck. This movie is a parody of "Hoods & Hearts", with characters dressed in red and blue vests, "HOODs & HEARTS" outfits, and even with a white hat. I thought it was a great idea to have a movie where the main character gets the chance to work with some of those guys that got beat up by "HOLES & HEART" and get back on the streets. butbutbut because the movie was done at Universal Studios, Universal Studios owns the rights to that movie, and the company had the right to the movie. And because the director wanted to try to make it a little less serious than the first movie, he was "Hoovering" up these characters and "Losing" this opportunity to have the guys get on the street.   I think that the best way to make this movie was to have "HOOVER" (or Universal Studios) hire a bunch of young guys who played the part of "hiding behind a bush" and "wearing white T-shirts" and have them try to act as though they are the guys in the movie, but if they really wanted to see this movie made by these guys who were still in the hood, they could've done that. I guess that's what they did with this movie because it was fun and I'd like them to have it. (But in all seriousness, the director's next film is a straight-to-video sequel to this movie; "Hoot" or "Hook", which was a direct-to film sequel, is another film, so I'm assuming this will be a direct sequel to Hoot & Hook, which will be released soon). And I guess, for some reason, the story needs to be told from the side of the hood. If you want to watch the movie "Hoosiers & Hustlers", you'd really just have to read the book, which you can get on Amazon or something).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even believe it. I can watch the last movie in it's entirety, the final movie should be banned. If you can get through that last movie, don't bother. I'm sure it was great. A great cast, the story was great, the moviebut not the same one we're looking for, so we're seeking for that. The movie is going to be a big hit. It has got the great John Goodman as the title character. But it has to be released, not in this state, that's for sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this were a comedy, I'd give this film an 11, possibly higher. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been a huge fan of this guy, and he was really the reason why I started watching the movie, he was a "B-movie", which is a short movie made when he had just left the US after producing several "B" movies (i.e. the original "Citizen Kane"). And this is a pretty "B". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of John Singleton, one of my favorite directors, and I think he would have a lot to say about this film. John Singler is a veteran actor who's best work is in "Dawn Of The Dead" and in other films he makes this movie look like a horror flick. The actors aren't good. They don't even seem to want to take their scenes seriously (even John Singlton was on the set), and the story doesn't go anywhere, you don't get any sense that this was a movie being made for fun, you get a sense that it was a film being made to have a really fun, high budget film. The film is basically a horror film, a horror that people like John Singlen would watch and that makes sense. This movie has some good stuff, it has the beautiful shots of Singlaton's character and it has some real shock value scenes, it also gives a great sense of sadness and terror in the scenes. Singleton is supposed to be a big star who can make a movie like this look good.  I love to see John Singlar on this movie. This film is about John Singlon (you don't see him much in this movie, probably because he's not the most physically imposing man) and this was his last horror movie and it would make sense to end on a really great high point.  In my opinion, he's in his prime and he could have helped this film in some interesting scenes.   The film was made at the height of Singlon's career and he made this for his daughter and his niece. It was one of the biggest breakfasts he could make. John is a great actor, he just needs to take on a role that will get the "film experience" in which he's more than good enough, I can't imagine that this film was done by Singlon because he didn't want to see it made into a "high budget" film, so I can see why he's saying how he wants it to be released and the horror genre is a huge one with the success of "DAWN OF THE DEAD", I can just imagine Singlon would have liked to see Singlons character played out for real and see him with real characters. It wasn't like that for him, and if he wanted to see this film released, he did so by giving himself the opportunity to make it more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to enjoy this movie. It's the first film, it was "Tetris." Tetris was a game that was just that; a game. Tetris 3, is probably the most complicated game I've ever played (and I've played several), so it's just that this movie is not a commercial success, despite having a cast of top-notch talent (some of whom I don't know). I find it really hard to understand the motivation behind this movie's marketing campaign, which I've been following the film for several months. It doesn't seem to have had anything to do with Tetris as a game, but is an ad for a movie. I'm glad for the movie's fans that I can see the film on TV, and appreciate that this has a very good review and has been voted to be the best movie of 2005. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens with "The Man on the Mountain" and his friend(s) driving a little mountain buggy. Then it moves through the mountains, where the film seems to be going somewhere. It makes me think of "The Seven Year Itch" (another film about people who are in the mountains). The film seems as though it would end with some guy getting off the bike to wander into the mountains. The director had not yet heard of "Lone Ranger," the most popular of the "man on the mountain" films. I find this film to be an exercise in "mountain man." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a lot more going on back in the late '70's.   I don't know if I'm being naive or what. I think maybe it was the production quality back then that I was watching the movie on my VCR. And they definitely made a few million at the time. I mean, the film is actually called "A COUPLE OF GUY" which is very silly and silly in comparison to the film, the producers did spend the money on a really cool, totally awesome movie.  And the actors do deserve more credit than what they got here.  It's just a matter of how many bucks the production is willing to throw at it. Maybe it's just for the fact that it was an indie film when it was being released as a big blockbuster back in 2000. The people who are really pushing the idea of the film at the moment are pretty talented.  The film is about a bunch of hooligans, who are "hippies" in the most traditional sense.  I just don't think the people behind this one have the time to work on it and produce a film. They made the film out of necessity. They wanted to do a movie that got the message out, and they were successful in that endeavor. I was really thrilled by that effort, and I'm sure I still can get the message across. The problem is that I think this film is pretty much out there on the internet. It's pretty much an amateur production. It looks pretty crappy, and pretty much everybody in it. And in spite of all of the good work that was done on the film I think they could have added a couple thousand more minutes to the entire film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, this is an amateur effort, and so to be funny, and this could be a film from the great minds of the film industry, the director is being very wise and not trying to take over the movie with his "prestige" (as many in the movie seem to be). Also, for a movie that's only being made for the low budget, this movie will have to go through the same basic film festivals (or worse) as many other amateur movies. I'll give it this, I'm not sure what the director was thinking. For a film like this, to be as great as possible and in all respects worthy would require a very high budget that this movie does not have, and I'll be very honest and honest about that. This could be an epic comedy, and certainly would be made into a "Prestige Film" or something, and the film's production values are good, so they could probably work on this movie. The "serious" film is not meant to be a serious film. This is a comedy, not a serious "film" which is what it's meant to have been. If I could give a 10-15 rating to this film (which is what the film was), it would be "3-4". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must admit that if you are a lover of all things'spy' that you might get mad at me for giving away the whole movie.  And there are several reasons for that. They might say that this is a spy movie and if so I would agree with that. I don't know about you, but if this is one of the films that the CIA make'spies', it's all the more reason. Because if this movie is what they make'moles' of, you might as well not be watching it. Not for me to put my name on this one. I would recommend watching the first three parts of this movie (with the help of the folks who wrote the movie). There are also a few films in the world where people were paid to do exactly this movie. And even those films are far better than this. And if you haven't already seen this film, don't do it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be blunt about it. There's no plot. I'm glad that there are two leads, and they could be a double feature, because this film is a bad film. It's no movie. It doesn't have any point. I was glad that this film has a little movie in it, because it's a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending of this film is not very good for all of us actors and for the fact that it goes back and forth between the two different perspectives on the same story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is directed by Steven Soderber who has a big following. The director is responsible for the story, but not in writing or directing. It doesn't take long to realize why the movie is not entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film, and not an entertaining one.  The plot is just about what happened before (the original "The Ring" movie). It's a film that was shot in Italy. We don't know who wrote it, and we can't understand why the director should have cast Italian actors (who can act). It would be easy for a director to change the ending of this film, which ends in a few days. I don't understand how they are going to try to revive this film. It's really about "how to make a film, about "The Making of a Legend", not about "Making a movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit that the original version was very good; it had an excellent screenplay and had a lot of great actors who are good actors.  In this remake it seemed like the writers just went straight to the story, and maybe it just seemed to go straight to television, and they've got a whole lot to go through. The film had very little production value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is pretty terrible. The plot is basically the same from the first film and only one thing makes it worth watching. The other three of us are the only ones that had it better. We had to pay for it, so please, don't waste your money on this movie. It's OK to watch the first and second film. It doesn't cost much and we all saw them on video. This is not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horror film that is supposed to scare people, and to some degree, shock them. This is not a movie that will make you feel good about watching it. I have to admit that I was not exactly going for a good movie here. There was a movie called "Avengers" that was pretty awful, and that was more of a horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What do you think about this film? I think it's because they like it, and there's more than one person in the world who likes it, or because there's a good story to tell. Or maybe it's just because it's an art film. There's no guarantee at all that it will actually be good art. I had my own experience as a film director, and I think that, as an art-film director, I would be wise to be a bit more open and honest with what I'm saying. I mean, after all, when I had this idea for a movie about a good romance, there's no reason to write, as is usual, something about some of the most important things in life, like love and friendship, about the relationships between two human beings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been almost 20 years, and the movie wasn't very good at all. The girl was very beautiful and cute. This movie is about a typical movie made by a studio that is interested in making money. This film was nothing. I saw this movie twice. I was expecting to be very hard on the film since this is a pretty good film to watch as it has some great music. The ending was even worse than the final scene of "The Ring" which had been released, and that movie was a little more brutal, like this one had some horrible girl at the end. The film was very disappointing and very poorly made. The acting is terrible, the movie itself is just bad and it doesn't make you feel anything. The movie was made by people who have been making movies for years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I watched this movie I thought it was just a movie about a bunch of guys who were just gonna go out to dinner to have dinner. I thought they would just come in, meet up with each other, get married, have kids and have a family. I mean, it could be an "urban" film about people who do all kinds of business in New York or something like that.  If I was ever in the position of having to hire, I would probably ask myself if the guy was a genius or a genius. When I read that the film was based on a true story and was a real historical story I had to really sit down and think about it.   This movie is just a bunch two or three guys (that would be about the only two or maybe three in it) who happen to be walking down the street and they're hit by this guy, who gets hit by two of them and they stumble off to get treated at the hospital. It is pretty boring and really just like the first movie (although they actually get away with a lot less serious tone). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's interesting to see how the different religions and philosophies are depicted here. It's true that in the movie The Bible, religion was very strongly defined and used to make a point. I wanted to see what effect religion would have in a film, given the nature of the material, and to my surprise, this movie was pretty much the same as the last movie, which really left me dumbfounded. It wasn't even funny to watch, and it was so predictable. I was completely bored, and I couldn't stop laughing after watching this movie. It was like it was made in the eighties with bad special effects, and bad special music. There was only one good scene, in the end where someone was eating in the kitchen with a potato in his hand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure it's just a few people who like the "original" version of this film and who are just getting started on the DVD set, the majority of the DVD audience is about to watch this movie, and there are a lot of "original fans" and "original film fans" who are going to see the movie. The majority of "film fans" out there are going for the "director's cut" version. I'm guessing that most of them, after viewing the movie, probably won't see the director's cut version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made during the 1960's and was shown to people who were at the age when this movie was supposed to be being made. The time period is between 1960 and 1968 and that was the reason I rented this movie. I had a question of whether it would be on a T.V. system or the VCR, I thought that it would only be a matter of time.  If you've ever seen a movie with a good cast like "The Godfather," you'll know what the people in this movie are like.butbutbutBUTbutbutthough the people I knew were still alive, they had died about a year earlier than the time the movie was going to be shown. They were not replaced by people who are good at acting and who can really portray them (like the good people who worked on this movie). I feel like I had spent about 8 years of my life on this damn movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen some other reviews that talk about this movie being a documentary on some real documentary makers, so I thought I'd go see the movie first and make sure that I didn't waste my time. That movie wasn't really a documentary of any sort, so there was really no point of spending 5 minutes of my time in the film, let alone watching it again. The whole movie was about a very small handful of people, in a very self-absorbed manner, without any real insights into what it's like to be in an environment that has to deal with things like addiction, abuse, depression, etc. This movie was actually about how great it was, and there is nothing for me to recommend to anyone who is interested in it, because it's awful! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie was made in 1975, it would still be on the shelf. In 1973, this was released. The film was made when the movie industry was very small. It is not a surprise that there are terrible film clips that try to be funny. It was bad. I did see the film in 1973, and it was made for my family, and I think it is still on the shelves somewhere. It wasn't that bad. It could have been in black and white and made a decent joke with the same director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie interesting in the first 30 minutes. Maybe it was the character's of the film that I find "unlikable". My Grade for this movie was 1/10. I will watch the movie again... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For most of this movie, the lead actress (who is in the role of 'Anna') was on her way to a nearby audition for the movie. The cast is made up of several unknowns: a bunch of actors that have been around the block (or at least one of them); the acting is so bad, not even the best of the first two films were as bad. I am not a great fan of the movie, and I am certainly no saint in terms of film-making, either. I thought that there were so many films I was going to see, and that it would be a real treat to be able to see it with a bunch friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie. It does not deserve any of it's cast. And it's awful even for a remake. It's awful.  I hope you understand why, I truly did not expect to be watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a horror movie, a thriller and it has to do with killing, because it's a big studio film that's trying to pull off the same movie it made with just one small part in the Philippines. The Philippines is a small island with a population of about 300,000 people and one of the movie's main actors is a male who's got quite the reputation for getting in fights and getting in the wrong situations. His name is Edgar Matobato Jr. and he's not a big guy, is a really small guy with an average height of about 5'7 and he got in a fight with a local sheriff who had nothing but his shirt and pants on his back and he knocked him down and knocked his head on the floor because he thought he was the sheriff, and so he's got some serious bruises from this film, and for his efforts, so is the sheriff's son. So it's not just some guy who is a little too tough, he got hit in a real scary situation by Edgar Matoybo Jr. In fact, he looks at least five years older, so please watch out for that kind of violence.  This is the movie, but you have to be OK with the movie and the other actors and actresses who are playing it. The Filipino actors are pretty good, especially the ones who are in the local government offices and the local police force.   It's just that the majority of the Filipino men are really small, and the majority is from the countryside, they tend to have a bit of a more rugged look. A lot of them are Filipino-American or American-Filipino (that's what they call themselves) and they're the men who are actually killing people, or running the business end of it, so they're going to look the part, and most of the women are looking the part too. They're big, they're pretty cute and most are beautiful. They look good, and it's nice to see that some of them have worked in movies. Some of the guys are actually looking good for a movie too, although the one who stars in this film was in a really crappy one before, and he was probably too heavy in the movie. He was kind of a bad guy who was kind-of bald and a bald guy in this one. I'm not making fun of him as a small guy, he's a bald man in real life. Maybe you could find him in the back of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what people were expecting. They should have gone into it with more expectation that, as it is their first film. There was an extra special director involved. The story is not simple, the time is short and there is no special effects to save the day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just found out about a documentary about how to make a movie. I didn't want a film. I was the one who wrote the "open letter" to the director. I'm sorry for that. I don't have the right to be the judge, but the director did not make me care. Even though the first three minutes of the movie were nice and funny, it showed the director, and the two girls in the movie.  The director tries to make the viewer believe that the girls really want to be in the film, or that the director really believes they are attractive, or whatever he tries to convince us. That's what the girls look like to the audience, as well as the two older guys. One of the older boys (the one who's in the hotel room next to them when they are talking with the director) tells the girls he's a producer, while they look like the girls from the opening scenes. In fact, the director didn't show us the girls' hair.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, not just about that.  I watched the movie with my husband, and he and I went to the movie theater with a bunch of friends and relatives of friends of friends. I know there is no "Cinema 101" lesson for it. Maybe that is why I had to watch this film, but even so, my husband and I had no idea that it would be as painful as it was.  This film does not make sense at all. It does not appeal to your basic sense of humanity, to your intellect. To quote some of the reviewers here. "Tasteless," "so bad, that it is good, horrible, ridiculous, stupid, or outrageous."  The film itself is like a movie about a religion. A Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or Hindu would be utterly repulsed, insulted and insulted by this film. The worst thing that could be said about the film is "good" or "good movie." It's just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of a "post-apocalyptic" or "post-" film is pretty much the only thing this film is supposed to be about. I found the "post" part of the film pretty much as mindless as the first half of the movie. The characters are flat and uninteresting. They're basically the bad guys in "Day of the Dead".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am in my mid-twenties, and my husband was in his mid-thirties when we got married. The one good thing in this movie is that, it does contain some nudity in the shower, and in the bathtub. It does have an adult film on DVD, which I got when my husband and I met, as an adult. We got some of our close friends in the movie as extras in this.  The first movie, after a few minutes, the only one in the bathroom was a towel and I think it is more explicit, and the second movie, the shower scene in the hotel bathroom, was actually more explicit. (I think it was in the third movie, which is in the theater at Universal Studios). In the shower scenes in this one, I think they are just a bit too close to the camera for my tastes. I am a man who has never been a porn star, and am just not sure if my wife's or my tastes would be offended by this movie, because, honestly, we just enjoy good, old fashioned Hollywood films, and these movies seem to be completely out of step with how movies are made now, and with my wife.

I've seen this movie for the past four days and there's something missing - or something so horribly that it doesn't even deserve to be called a film. The film itself is good, you don't have to go into details, it's a film with good actors and excellent lighting. I like the film and the idea of this one, I am trying to find out why I have to waste my precious time on this "film."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems that Hollywood is not all that different from the rest of the entertainment industry. Movies like "The Godfather" are very popular (at least they are still available on video). I am glad that I have not seen this one. The Godfather was a great, true, and well-told movie. A very good one.  I have seen many movies about the Mafia or Mafia families. I know them all and was amazed at how closely the two movies are alike. I am not expecting much more from this one--it is hard to see how this could be good, not that this is a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I'm trying to understand is if this is a movie with no plot, and how it is somehow going to be a movie about a dog. I hope I find out how the movie is going to make sense. I'm already going to wonder how it will be funny, since the dogs are portrayed as little more than cartoon characters. It's just one of those animal movies that can't resist trying to appeal to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a remake of the first film. We all know the first one is better than this remake. The sequel takes place in a world that is almost identical to the original world. We know what happened in the first movie, with a bunch of different characters, with no time-travel or anything like that. We don't know if they took into consideration the problems with time-travelling in this sequel, or whether the original movie took place in the future, because it does not appear that we have seen any of the time-jumping technology from the first story. This film is about the same time period as the first, and it appears they decided to make the same movie. I would advise people to see the first. I'm sure people love to jump off the cliff into the ocean, or climb a mountain at night, or jump into the time vortex. They do have these time-dancing gadgets that can travel through time. They just never jumped off a cliff or into the Time Vortex. This is about as time-bending as it gets.   They want you to think they've done some kind of time-twisting trick here, which is the film's own fault because they gave me a preview of this film, but I can't imagine it was fun, fun, or interesting to watch. And it is not at all like a film that's got a good cast that could make you feel like you're in the world of the characters, and in control of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed watching the first show, and that was mainly because it was a show on a TV set, and so that was my "TV" show. As I am typing this review I am watching it on the internet, which is really the "Movie" show, which as I said is not my "Citizen's" TV show, for it is a totally different show, that I am just very bored of it, and for two reasons. It is very poorly acted by the lead actor, and the rest of the cast, which I was watching it with. I'm a big believer that there is always some good acting in movies, and people who are familiar with American movies, as I was, or who were familiar with the first series, they know how to act very well, I know I did so in the first film, for example in "The Avengers", where I acted opposite James Coburn (who is great and in this movie, in his last movie) so it's hard for me to take it seriously, I'm going to give it a rating of 1. I give this movie 1.5 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought that this movie would be a true Hollywood remake of The Ten Commandments, in which the Ten Commandment is so famous (to my knowledge) and probably one of the most powerful Christian movies ever. This movie is pretty poor. The film was based on the Bible. I have to admit that this was the first film, and I was actually pretty good at the Bible, and was the main reason I watched this movie. I had read the film and seen it. There's nothing in the movie. It wasn't good enough to even review as a parody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a real shame for these people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw it in New York City and the poster says that it is from Los Angeles. So, yes, it is the same film, except for the title.  The "dissed" people who gave it, were a pretty funny joke.  They were the ones who had the chance to have some fun with it. They could laugh and make fun of the film if they really wanted to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no redeeming factors in this film. If you enjoy it, go for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this film in a month's time, so I had high hopes. If there were no reviews about this film, I might be tempted to give it a rating in the 7's or 8's or whatever. If this were my only movie, I would say that it might be a little less brutal than the other, or not as brutal as the other. I'd probably still recommend that they look for that type of film, because I don't think it's going to be as "grindy" or "tough" as some people would be expecting, but I just read it, and was kind of expecting to read some other review that had to do with some real violence or real gore, and there is a certain gore-fest quality to this film which is pretty much "everything you can think of". In one scene, there's a decapitated head being thrown down the stairs (that's one of the examples given for the death of a police officer).  A good example of that is one of these guys being stabbed to death.  The next scene features a decapitation scene (I know, it's really graphic and doesn't reflect that movie at all), and the guy in the hospital talking with the doctor, and his decapitated neck still hanging out on the wall!   So, the film is definitely brutal, especially in the sense of blood and guts (but if you get caught in a hospital ward and there's some kind of zombie attack, you'll be just fine), and I really don't recommend people sitting down with the camera lens right in your face and filming anything they've got "raw".   If you really want to see a movie that does reflect that of a hospital, and you like watching a lot of gore in your film, you can watch this, because it's pretty brutal, and the camera can make you vomit (I've made this film before) if you're having a hard time keeping your eyes open. I also found it fascinating to see some of the different perspectives of the police and the criminals. The first guy that we see in the beginning is pretty good, and he does get a good glimpse of the bad guys' mentality.  But this movie is a complete 180, and I don "get" what's going on. I'm a cop. My department is a violent one, so when a cop sees a bad guy on the news, I just can't understand the "message". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about the best of all worlds. The director went all out,butbutbutBUTbutbutandbutbutthebad thing is it really isn't worth the four dollars. The movie wasn't bad because it could have been that's all.  It was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had read somewhere in the history of Hollywood that people in the 1930's, 1940's, etc. were actually making a better deal, and were making the kind of films that were considered a "standard" (as far as the film industry was concerned) as compared to the one that the film was. I think most people know that when people in those days would go to the movies, they would go with their friends who were also there. For me, it was a bunch of people just out for fun, and there was nothing really special about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The final scene of this movie is a real sad look, very sad look. It looks like this was a very sad ending for a movie that was about a happy ending with the ending song. I hope the next movie is better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not entirely certain why, but this film really is one long story of its own. Not a single one of the actors is on screen, or appears in some fashion.

And so now I canbutbutbutandthat I don't find myself as attached to the character.  I don`t think I`m the only one to notice it, but this movie is really, really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really loved the way the show dealt with the drug addict issues, I am willing to give it all. I was able to find a movie in which there were no drug addicts and I would like to give the credit to the writer and actors. But the film industry has really taken a hard line in regards to drugs. And that's the thing.  I mean, that was never even a question.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A great director and writer should have got me to see this movie at the least because this movie was a great opportunity to go off on a great movie about "The Godfather," the great Charles Laughton should have stepped up and really done this movie the way it was supposed to be done. And I think for him it's his best chance to do so with the upcoming "Godfather" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen one of the first of these movies, this one was supposed to be the sequel to "The Matrix" (which was released a few years earlier). I can't say that this is the best version of the Matrix, nor that it is one of my favorites. The whole idea of the "Red Wheelie" movie was that this was an updated version of a very good movie, and it has the same actors. They weren't good in this version. I'd recommend that you spend an hour or two watching this version of "The Red Wheelie," which is the movie that was released about a year ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't want to see any of the actors in the movie, I just wanted to see some of the movie. I thought the movie was funny, and the movie "The Hangover" was funny in that it was based on some of "The House's" actors. They were actors who worked in the comedy films, they were also comedy writers and could do funny comedy. The other guys (and girls) were comedy writers.  I mean this movie is so bad. You can't really even laugh at it, really. You couldn't even see the movie in a theatre, and at the end, I thought I would just go, and see the funny movie. It didn't make me laugh at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very bad from the beginning. Some people say that it's the worst of all time, but when it comes to the movie, if you pay your attention to it, you can see that the film has no continuity. Some scenes are bad, because they're filmed from one angle, so you have to see them from multiple angles. For example, some scenes are so boring, that it makes me angry, because when I'm watching this movie, I don't understand how it got made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about "The Journey" which means it's about two groups of four people each one trying to get to another place (i.e. to "The Summit" where they hope to get rescued). This movie was made in 1994, it's going to take a decade to make the movie, but it's interesting to see how people were back in the day with primitive weapons that look like modern weapons - and how people still have primitive weapons nowadays. If the movie was like this one, it would be a great way for people to show how far they've come. It would be great to show the modern day "militants" as primitive, but I think this movie has the advantage of having the real people back there on the island in the movie. This means they get to see the actors get killed, get maimed, and get injured in the process of doing what they were doing when they were in a real place, rather than making a movie about the death of the actors and trying to re-enact the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I must say that I have not seen this movie, and it would have been impossible for me to not be prejudiced towards this movie because it is a low budget indie film that is made of cast off the back of some film students who didn't know anything about film production or what it all looked like to them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, the last film, was a horror film, with gore.  I think that some people thought that this would be a comedy, with some kind of laugh. I know that they are fans of horror comedies (who are certainly funny) and, of course, have probably seen a lot of the films that have been released before this one, including some that have not been released yet). And, let's just say that it was really really horrible. If you don't hate yourself, you're going to laugh at it. I think I was pretty embarrassed, if anyone is interested in my age and look and size, not just the fact that this movie is made and has been put out there. It is an absolutely horrible horror that should never be allowed to be released. The actors' voices are so awful, it's not funny or good. The special effects are, if not worse than the film's production, then, at the very least, ridiculous, and, if you're an avid fan of the kind of movie I'm sure this is, and it is actually kind of hard to watch. The movie looks and sounds like it was made to be a horror movie (you can even compare it to a porno). The actors are terrible and, at least, you'd think that they had some knowledge of the genre. The directing is terrible, not scary, horrible, and so bad it makes it a mockery of what they tried to do. The only thing in my opinion that could possibly redeem this movie, is the sound. So, if it were possible to have some kind off of a DVD I would recommend giving this a 10 out of 10, as a rip off of any kind of release (I was, after all, very happy with the release of this movie). I would like to make some kind word of good about the film that is available for the people to watch in Spain, because I think there are some films available, some kind horror flicks, and I didn't just watch it, and if it was possible I would suggest to go to Spain and see this and see how it is available and see the people's reactions, and even then I don't recommend seeing it, because if this is what is released to America, that is the only way to see it, it is one of the worst films ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I like a certain amount of film-making, and am a big fan of the director of "NIGHTCY," with his films being "made in the dark." This film isn't even supposed to be about the film industry, the film itself doesn't even have an "artist" tag on it.  If I wanted to watch it on a low budget, I'm sure I'd be able to find some pretty decent amateur film, since there are lots of film students and amateur filmmakers making movies around the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was made in 1990 and the film was actually very good. There is a scene where two teenagers get into an argument over who is the more annoying.  The scene is in the movie "The High School Years".  The film does have a "High School Years" scene at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I do not think the movie was a bad one. I think it had good message.  I have seen the movie "Citizen Kane" and I have also watched "The Godfather" in which Francis Ford Coppola has directed, and both those movies had a similar story and are both considered classics. The story of "The Blind Man's Club" was much less successful. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is into historical movie. I saw the movie after watching "The Orator". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not surprised by the number of movies on the shelf. I'm surprised by how many people in the world actually get it. It's not funny or light. I found myself laughing hysterically. What's up with that? It didn't make me think it was going to be funny at all, and I was truly horrified at the end of it, and it made me angry with just one look.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about a man who, it seems, is obsessed with the idea of making a movie about the life of a woman, and that man was so obsessed with it. He was the one who made all the decisions, he was the writer, he made all of the decisions about all of his decisions. But, sadly, he is obsessed, apparently, with the notion of the life and death of a lady. The whole point of this film was to show how he lost his virginity in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of all of the actors in this film, and am very grateful for their effort in their roles.butbutbut.I am a big fan of writing as well, and I'm hopeful that when I watch the screenwriting department of this film that the writing department will be able to get a decent screenplay. There are about 50 minutes of screen time at the end of the film, which can be attributed to the movie being an hour and forty minute movie, and this is the first time I've seen this particular film that this happens, and it occurred on a film with a great screenplay--so I'm hoping that a great script will allow the audience tobutbut but the screenwriter is now the movie producer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very slow, which is why I watched this movie with friends, I was hoping to be amused, or just to watch a friend, which made me want to go ahead and rent it for the laughs. I wasn't even remotely amused. The characters were unsympathetic, the dialogue unfunny, and all in all, this is a movie that I will probably watch over and over again if I need an hour or two. You really need to like this movie to laugh. And then the movie starts, and after about 15 minutes, which takes me around 5 minutes to get my brain going again, and not a good movie.  I highly recommend this movie not to rent or watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For those that love a story like a movie, that may be a film like "The Omen", where they just jump into the story and watch a story they know, I don't think you're going to find much value in this movie. The only thing I will say that I liked was the ending of "The Thing" and some of the characters of this movie, the idea of having some sort of human connection to the characters. Maybe if they all have some kind of human relationship at the end of the movie. There is absolutely no reason to even consider watching this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been around these kinds of films, and they are not usually the most violent of them. Even though I am a fan of some of the films here, I am still very upset by this movie. This movie is a mess of an independent film. Some of the actors were so horrible I didn't even want to see them anymore, and I could tell that this is a movie that is probably going to get made again, which means I can just say that if you want to buy it, it would be the only thing I could recommend it, and you would be better off renting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was released in January 2005, and it was supposed to have the highest production value because of the high budget and talent involved. I mean, it's hard to believe that these are the actors' first roles in movies.  What little I saw was on TV while this movie was still being shot, and the dialogue, and most of it could be classified as a novel, and could have been edited to be less offensive. This movie really should have been titled "Hollywood Blunder" because it contains some really bad actors. It's just so bad. It reminds me of the first "Ghostbusters" movie, and I don't want to make light of a classic. There's enough terrible characters here to fill a small island. It could only really be saved by an original, cheesy screenplay and it didn't happen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw the trailer I thought, oh this will be a low budget movie, maybe there will be some sort of comedy. I knew this would be a terrible movie, but it would be worse. The acting is amateurish and completely amateurish. If you think it's funny, you're kidding yourself.   What's really worse, I couldn't really figure out why the film was trying to create something that would be like a comedy, I think it was actually trying to make something that was like a thriller. Maybe, it was trying really hard to create some sort out comedy.  As for the ending, I'm a bit of a fan of what's called "drama, you know, the film, and this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie does feature some of the real life heroes in there, and it will have a bunch of people talking about their experiences with the real heroes, and I found them pretty good. We've had this movie on TV, with real life actors and the real story behind it, for some time, it has been out on DVD with a bunch more real actors. This is the first one of a series, the second being The Fall of the House of Usher, which was also on DVD. The movie features none of the good actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw the film, I was intrigued by it being about the "secret world" - the whole idea of a secret world is intriguing, particularly with the "The Island of Dr. Moreau", where it was a secret island of a lost civilization. When I watched the film on tape - I can honestly say that I cannot stand the film. The acting was bad - the only redeeming factor in the film is that it was supposed to be filmed on location with the island of Dr Moreau. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure if it's because of the movie or because of me, but it appears that I am the only one out of the cast that was not in the film that made a movie, and it was just for 2 days. I'm the only person that did a movie. This is a sad way to end it. I hope they just have to re-write the script. I was really looking forward to seeing the other characters. I really had a nice laugh when I watched this on the show and was just a fan watching this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't believe that it is a true "drama". I mean this movie was a bad attempt at satire... It's so bad, and it was SO bad for a woman to come in it, so so bad... So, I don's t believe that there is any way that it could possibly turn out good in some form or form... So I give it that rating... 1 out of 5, which means that I don' t recommend you watch this... I gave it a 5 because I liked it when they released it and thought that it was in a "classic" sense... That's not my opinion. I give this movie an absolutely horrible rating, and that is just ridiculous... There was no reason that they did this movie, it sucks, and if it has any redeeming value whatsoever, I think it would make you wish for the last 10 minutes of it to end, like a bad sequel...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best thing about this movie was that it was supposed to be a black comedy. A young black actor (who was cast in "Get Smart" and "Get in Shape") will do a cameo. I had hoped that there would be more of an opportunity to see what "Get In Shape" star and father, Walter Matthau (who has done some acting) did in that role.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see some film buffs tell me exactly why this movie was made. I was interested to see a film that was more about "How it got made"  It was probably about a month or so ago. I'm curious to see if this movie is actually for any profit to those that have actually paid for it. I'd say that there are many, many reasons why this film is so, so, bad. And it's just one of them, because I'm sure it will keep coming up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I like about films like "Gremlins" is that they feature a killer who's face is on the cover. In this film, the face was in the very top corner and I'm not sure why they would have wanted to market this film as something for guys to see.   I'm sure this movie won't turn into a complete flop for bad taste. It wasn't that bad, I enjoyed the first "Death Wish" film, "Death Pact" (by the way). There was a good story and a lot of humor in that film, this is just another attempt of trying to be a sequel of the first film, which wasn't successful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had the opportunity to view this movie with other people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite character (and a big part of my childhood) is in it but that's the only one I can watch, it's been on TV in "The Secret World" and "World of Warcraft", where the rest of the characters have been played. In the end, I don't think anyone's going to find the movie appealing, either from the time that I finish watching it, to when I actually get back to the hotel. This movie is the equivalent of the "Final Cut". It's about to be removed from a video store.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found out about this movie at least a couple of days before it opened and was looking forward to checking it out. I didn't know much about "The Omen" (it's a pretty obscure horror), but after I saw this I was pretty sure that "The Amityville Horror" would be the one to come out of the original production house and I didn and don't plan on going back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well this is just a film, but it does have the good (and I'll get back to that) of a script that could go on to give some sort of explanation as to how the characters live and what is happening in this particular film. I'm a sucker for the "life" genre, so I'm willing to read the script.  The film is in a different world than our own. The world is a very strange place. The two main characters are not alone. I don't know why they have to be alone in a strange place and don't have some form of a proper relationship. We're just not supposed to know the character in a "serious" way, let alone "serious drama" format. They're just too old. They look too old to be in their prime and too young to be their age.  They're also too old for their own character. (They're also pretty ugly.)  The characters are very strange. They are so unemotional. They were obviously written by two guys with the "ideal" screenplay. I mean really. I just don't really care what happened to them. It's just too late for this. They had just been given their first Oscar nomination.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only positive review was on IMDb and IMDB, and I was very curious to see what this movie was all about. I'm not a huge fan of "B" or "A" films, nor am I a fan of the movies made by Robert Altman and Altman-Paul Thomas. Altman's films were quite good, he is one of the few film-makers with a few of his films to be released on DVD in the US. Altiman's "The Big Chill", for example, or "Citizen Kane", or any of Altman films, are still considered classics by many, and Paul Thomas' "Starry-Night" is a masterpiece in both of those cases. I am in no way biased towards those who want to see Paul Thomas or Paul Altman work, nor do I think that anyone has to see these two films. There are just two "B"- and one "A"- films to complete the story of "The Way West". It was a "B- film" directed by Frank Marshall, who had directed some of the other great films in the "A-series", and it's not like it cost anything in terms of money. This movie was made by Frank J. Marshall, and it cost a whopping US$3,300,000 to make. The same US$2,800,000 that was spent to direct "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" and "The Best Years Of Our Lives". That was the last movie, and this movie is a "A". The only movie that is similar in budget to the "The Last Story", is a production of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest", which is the same "A", with the exception of the two-day shoot that was made into a six-day "The Story Of The Invisible Boy".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was actually pretty good because the actor (Ron Moody) and the producer (George Lucas) used to have a mutual respect about one another. This was a one-room production, filmed at a really low budget, with a bunch of people sitting around a table, just trying to do what they could. They didn't have to work for a living, and they certainly did not have money to hire a bunch actors, and that, along with the poor quality of the script and production, makes this a sad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film to find out why the movie made $3 million, and that was to try and find out whether the movie was just bad, or if it's really bad?  It's a terrible rip-off of a piece of art that really had to be done for the money. It looks like it was done by someone who got his hands on the book and didn't understand it and then had his hands shoved in his mouth trying to make it look good, he's made to look like he's a good guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with the two main characters. In this story, the main characters are supposed to have two stories with two heroes and two heroes.  This movie starts out by showing the heroes talking and having conversations with each other and talking about things.  My first thought, being that we have a very big audience (3,000+ in this country), would be that I'd have to write a negative piece of review. My main thought would be: "I have a big audience!"   I don't want to put it in this film, I just want to be accurate. I won't ruin my kids' or grand kids' lives over this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that it's because it's a "pilot" for another series. I don't know what happened in "The Pilot" that I could compare it with. "The Writer" does not seem to have a handle on this pilot and doesn't have a plan.  It's not a bad show. There are many people that can't handle "The Blacksmith", who cannot believe that it would be able to survive the world's worst conditions. The "Blacksmith" had to make a real "Black" show that was the only "Black-smith", while this "Black Smith" has to try to survive on the "Black TV" that everyone who sees this show will see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to the video store after being a big fan of this movie, and they are the reason I watch this movie. I was under the impression they were out to destroy this movie; the whole film was a bunch of people talking to each other while I waited for the inevitable ending. They really did it forbut I will say that they should have done it better and maybe made a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why i watched this movie is because of the fact that it was directed by a guy who is currently directing the movie in my hometown.  The plot is about as dull as the best movie I have ever seen. It was a very stupid movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just another comedy that I was disappointed with. I think everyone else was laughing at the stupidity of the other people. I couldn't laugh at the idea behind it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the first film and thought that they might be able to somehow change me or convince me of their way of life; that was really only one character, and the director is right there; the film itself is pretty much devoid of characters. I have to give this film a score on the film-the-film, since it's about a woman being tortured for over an hour before she kills herself, which is certainly gruesome, I would rate this film for being a "brave" film, not a "shockumentary" like the film of the "Woman in Black." This film was bad from the start, and it had nothing to recommend it. The way the film tries to make it "sexy" by having the torture woman "enjoy herself" is just plain annoying.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens on a dark, rainy day, with a man (played by Joe Don Baker, the actor best known for his role as the narrator in "The Goonies") and the story goes on. In this version, the story is told in flashback, with the man in a hotel, and it's quite terrible. If you really want to watch the film, don't do this one. I would recommend it to people who are fans of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For some reason, I just found myself at the airport at 6 o'clock at night, and I didn't want to waste a lot of time and energy. The acting is terrible. You can't see the difference between a real person and an artificial person.  A man dressed in a tuxedo is just another guy. If this guy were to ever be on TV, he would be the last one to ever get a job in film. This film was very strange, and disturbing, so you wouldn't be watching it for suspense or anything. If you don't watch this movie alone, or have the time and courage to watch this, don't even go to this film, or if you're alone, watch it with somebody who doesn't know you at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not all bad: I've never seen a movie where I loved it the way I love thisbutbutif you're someone who loves movies with a great cast and director, this movie isn't great. I think the actors do what they can with their roles, and the direction is just so simple and so boring. I was extremely disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not a terrible movie, because there are other horror movies and horror writers. I just watched this for some time, and I'm pretty sure I saw everything that was on the big screen. I was also very patient, and this movie wentbutbutbut... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was probably made on a Sunday. And this was a film from the mid-nineties (that's about 2 decades ago).   I was pretty impressed with the film because it wasn't full of crap--it seemed to have been well edited and done.but but unfortunately, it was not released in the UK or America and as far as I know, the US market only has it available on VHS (although I'm not sure why that is). (This was released in UK and Australia so it was the only copy of the US version, for what it's worth). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two really good performances of Robert Culpitt and Joseph Culp of Culpit, who are very close friends and the only two people who saw Culpitta's father. And Joseph Custer, Jr., who was Custer's neighbor in Indiana. The Custer family in general is pretty close to the Culpitte family.  I thought that the first Custer movie, where Custer and Custer were cousins, was the only decent performance in this movie.  The two young Custer brothers are very different from one another. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty sure I was going to see a really good, independent film for review. After watching it again and reviewing the trailer, I would like to say that "Independent Film", as far as a group of independent film fans are concerned, is pretty much a collection of "independent" films, which means, in effect, that all the people involved have some sort of financial stake in their work, and that they have no interest in doing this. And that, to be honest, they probably should have done this work for a living, not doing it for cash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as the acting goes, I didn't watch this movie in person--so I wasn't aware of the true extent of the acting in this movie, so I won't comment on this here. I did find the film amusing, that's because it wasn't a big budget movie, I suppose a few comedy actors could be found--I didn't know that this film would end up being this big. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am an old woman. I think this is a movie for the younger crowd, and it has been shown that this is the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For years, I was a fan of the late Michael Jackson, which is my favorite Michael Jackson film, as I watched the film, I didn't really like the look of it at all, which made me want to throw it out. I thought it looked like Michael Jackson's "Let It Go." So I would say that it was a better look for the Michael Jackson book. I'd also say that, for years, people have been commenting about the Michael King of Michael Jackson being on it. Now it does have the same number of songs on it, which was "Let it Go," which was the first book, which came out, and I think it's interesting to look at the cover, which has Michael Jackson and his "Let IT Go" on the cover.  I think that was one of the reasons why this movie is called "A Michael King production." The Michael King was on the Michael Jordan movie "Air" and the first Michael Jackson movie "Bad."  For the record, I actually love the cover of the Michael and Janet book, the cover for "The Magical World of Michael Jordan," which features him on it in an airplane. I think he would have made an amazing poster. Michael Jackson is great on the covers of his songs and he's done really well on the "Jungle Book" covers, so I would like to see him do well here as well.  The cover also includes "Jurassic Park" and "Michael Jackson" in the same position on the front of the book, but the cover is also a lot clearer, since they're not in an awkward spot on the film. There are also the words "Michael Jordan" on it so they're bigger.  So if anyone is in the neighborhood and sees the cover and they don't think it has Michael on it or something like that, they should ask the clerk at the movie theater where my number is...they were very nice about it. As far as Michael King's involvement, I have to say that I didn"t have any information about it at the time, so, I thought the cover was very good, but not of a Michael King film, so he's on the same level as Michael Jackson.   My friend, who was a writer for the Jackson film "Bad" in 1999, is no longer involved with the writing for this one. I didn"'t have much luck with Jordan's book because they don"t want the book to resemble
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are two actors who did this film (which I can't think of at this time), so I was hoping for some new actors to replace these actors.  We have seen other actors perform some of these roles, so why are we being asked to watch the same thing again, and again? I found this film completely ridiculous. It is like a comedy, a comedy with a couple of laughs at the end, it is horrible. It really takes you out of the moment of laughter with the way it tries to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really low budget. We've seen much worse films from this year, like "Dog Bite Dog." It's really hard to take this seriously, with the actors acting like they're on a really low stage, and the script was written like they were going to do a play.  In the interest of making this movie, you should at least go and see the "Dog People," you'll really find it to be an excellent documentary about the dog community, this is just a low-budget movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a huge fan of John Frankenheimer's work (he was a director of many films), and I have to admit the films of Paul Verhoeven were quite good. (I even had seen the German version of "The Naked Beach" in the 70's - they were made in Germany, after all). And this film was a bit too long and the story, although not completely uninteresting, could have used some more development - this is an Italian film, not English. I'm sorry to say that I think the audience is going to hate this movie - it's the only movie in history ever made for about two hours and forty minutes, and it's just completely incomprehensible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast was good, some of the great film-making talents of Richard Attenborough (the first of my three films, A.S.A.R.) and the lead character of Paul Muni (played by the great Richard Attenberg) in "A.SAR.R.". Richard Attenburg is one of the rare directors of his generation to get involved in making film, and was the first director to direct a great film, "The Great British Scramble", he was making a short film for the BBC). I was not sure whether I would have liked to see Richard Atteningberg as Muni, a very small, very good man with a wonderful personality in this film, since I am sure I'd never been in touch with the Munis back then), so, I was glad to see him in this.butbutbutBUTbutbutyet, when he turns around to be the little, lisping little actor who is supposed to be Muni's twin brother, I am not convinced that Muni is Paul Munis' twin brother in the "twin"'s' heads. Maybe this is the kind of thing that happens when you are about 4 or 5 years old, and he can't make facial expressions, or maybe it is just the character he plays, or the manner in which he was cast. It is not a great deal different from what I was seeing before, a fairly stupid kid with the same stupid haircut, trying to imitate Muni. There is no doubt whatsoever that he can act, but at the age of 9, you have to be much better than that, much smarter than Muni who can't act much, much less act convincingly. The reason he got a free ride in "The Incredible Shrinking Paul Muniband" is because he is so incredibly good at drawing, and the Muni character could be drawn very well. It's just not Muni-like.  Paul Munihot is Muni for life. I would love to see this kid in a movie, and have him play a really cool role, like his twin brother Muni in "THE THREE WOLVES". This is not Paul Muniak, and I don't know that I will ever want to see Paul Munick again, nor will it be the Munitonesque character in this role.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not an actor. I can't speak with authority about the other actors in the movie. It is only for the most basic of answers that the director can claim to have had a hand in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to try and be honest and say "Maybe" in the review, so as not to be a complete idiot (as I did) I went in for the "film" (that is the thing that you see) because, honestly, I wasn't going to see this movie for anything more than to give it an out of the box critical review (if such a thing exists). If you go in for some kind of serious commentary or critical discussion, you're going to have to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a remake of a great classic. In other words, this movie is a remake, and it's an over-long and over-priced flick, one that I didn't find entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I'm not one of those people that is always looking for the next great film. I've seen the "Great" John Carpenter's, "Big" John McClane, "Rio" John Woo, the other great John Singleton, "The Big Chill", "Big Lebowski", "A Gangster's Life", etc etc. I have also seen many great films, from the "Rocky" "Cypress Flats" to "The Sixth Sense", "The Ten Commandments", "Natural Born Killers", "Top Gun", etc. The "Big Chill" is really not "A man's film", despite what it was supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even rated or reviewed on IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of conspiracy theories out there about the CIA. There are those who would like to see the movie destroyed, and those who want to see a movie about the Kennedy Assassination.  I would be very honest and say that I have never seen the movie, nor am I familiar with the people who would make this judgment for me. I have read the book, and was very well taken in that book by the author, and I am sure the director would enjoy having me read the novel.  There is one more movie in the Kennedy assassination genre, "JFK", the "J.F.K." movie. This movie is about the death of JFK, not about the Assassination of John F. Kennedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm actually going to give this movie a very high review since it is the first one that got to me - there was the music, and they had to put some great music. They even recorded some songs and put them on the DVD! I'm going to assume it was in some of the newer editions of the story. This was the only movie I've seen that actually was released in a theater format. A lot of it had to do with the fact that it was made to look like it was going to be released on video. They were even getting the soundtrack from the record label (i think) and they used the music that was in the record version - they didn't have to do that. It looks like they did it out of convenience to the fact they couldn't find the record in their collection.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is that the "good guys are bad guys" and I must admit that this movie is one big mess. To make matters worse, the characters themselves are pretty bad, to say the least. This movie isn't good in any aspect except for the good-old-boy-to-girl-film type of Hollywood and if you were to take a chance on watching this movie, you might as well give it a pass as entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the book with the main character and her being a warrior, so if she was a warrior I'd be OK, like some of the other people who read the book or watched the movie.  Some of the warrior scenes are so much better than the warrior ones in the book.but but in the final movie it's all too late.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, let's put it this way. What we have are two trailers. One of them, is from 2007. I can only hope that they were only screening the new one. The original trailer was one of the most famous and well known trailer's for horror. I'll be shocked if they don't come to me in a box at the end.   So I'm sitting in this theater, waiting for this movie to be released on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say I'm one of those types who likes to sit back, and I don't really know why anyone would.  My wife and I had a hard time watching it, and the wife says the wife had a good laugh, and was really getting into it-- she was pretty cute. You could see her in the first movie when she was a teenager, or in the "Love Actually" movie-- she looks like an old woman with big glasses and her hair has been styled on it. She is very pretty.  I would like to say that my wife is not the type that is a lesbian-- she is not very pretty-- she's got that to be honest, she has very long hair-- and I can just imagine how it looks in that movie-- it was just not right, because it was not straight.  There was something about it in the film which I will not reveal-- I'm not very interested in showing my opinion on movies-- I'd rather do the same thing and watch the film, which is the same-- I think you can see it for yourself.  We also didn't have a computer, so it was all on the DVD-- and the film starts with a scene where Jane runs away from home-- and when Jane comes back to town it is in her underwear! I guess that was just to show her, you see it, I mean, it's hard to say "Look how good she is!"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching the movie with my boyfriend, when I watched the DVD I read the book and it was great, I saw some clips of people talking to it and those clips were interesting (I did a show where they did it live with the actor that was talking).  I have really big eyes and I love seeing pictures of them and seeing them on my computer screen in the book was really good.  The movie is pretty bad, the dialogue was pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst part of the movie is the last scene in which the doctor kills the boy. It's probably the least painful part of my life (although I didn't really want to see the boy die). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be about "I, the Boss" in the 80's, when, after reading the book, it became apparent that it had a lot more to do with a "B" Boss, and I'll just say it: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is supposed to be a comedy. It's supposed to have a plot, a point of view, and some kind of emotional response. I just saw a crappy movie that I never thought was gonna make it. I don't feel cheated in my life. I feel like I'm cheated of something very special,butbutbutBUTbutbut... The only thing that makes me feel like the movie was the crappy music is the crappy crappy acting that they are doing right now. There's a lot of potential here to make a really great movie, and the movie looks like it will just have to go with the movie that was released in theaters. The only reason I can say this is because the film is very low budget. It doesn't look as bad as this is in comparison to the crappy movie. I also felt cheated after watching it for two weeks. I think it looks like a really cool concept to make some kind off film about the relationship between some of the biggest stars in the world. I know there are some great directors out there, and I hope they see the film, and think that it could be something truly amazing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I found was that there were two or three actors in a movie, maybe there was a big budget movie, or two big stars, or even three big stars. Also, although the movie was not "star-studded" (I'm sure there were actors that were great actors), it had a big cast. So maybe there's some hope for that. There were probably some big names that would be in that role.  It was basically the same plot that I had seen in the book with the exception of a few twists that I will discuss later.  I've read the book, I thought this was my very first foray into "the big time" in the world of film, and just read the novel. The first part of the film is a great introduction to the world, and I was amazed at the brilliance of it, so I thought I was in for a treat, a sort of "film on the side" (the director is an excellent filmmaker). It is not at all a dull movie.but it certainly was my first foray in that world and I am very curious about what kind of world the big stars live in. That's why I think it was so important for the filmmakers to make the transition to the big screen, rather than to give their characters another two decades of life and experience. That was why they made the transition. And I don't think it helped them at all. They had a wonderful, interesting role forbutbutbut in the end they couldn't escape the fact that it all fell on the shoulders of the writer. This is why the film had to take a few of the "bible quotes" out of the book and explain their story (the only thing in the entire book was about how the writer and his brother became friends with them) and how their story has been re-written by someone else (one of them being the writer's brother). I'm not one to do the same myself! It's all about the story, the one thing this movie has been rewriting and the other is an incredibly disappointing version. I'd recommend that you skip it entirely.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd heard of this movie and heard that it was "good" or something. It was the movie that I went into. A small handful of people might have enjoyed it--they'd be able to sit down and have a nice little lunch and have popcorn and things like that. And this movie was awful in every respect. The movie is very predictable and boring.  The acting is bad. It has no real connection to the movie--the movie was nothing but pretentious trash that lacks any credibility whatsoever.  It was like watching a really bad comedy about "Life in general" and that's just not fair. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw "The Secret of NIMH," I was very surprised to find that the movie was called "The NIM Hymn." This movie was not very funny or funny at all. I gave this movie about two and a half hours and had it on cable. I've seen the other NIM movies that are about NIMh, this is a very poor imitation of a movie and a terrible attempt at making people laugh.

I just think, it's time. It would be a small film in this town with a small cast that would be it, just for fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After going through the film, I decided to write the review before I watched it. I really like to talk about the movie, I just had to convince my wife to sit through the entire film. As a film student myself, I thought it would be more interesting to go through it in the first 20 minutes or so to see if there are still parts that I didn't like and then show the changes in the movie. If you have ever seen a film, you know how films change over time so the effects really do change, though I guess that happens to more than the effects in an old film. I thought that this film was so butchered it's good for you to read the other comments about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What really bothered me about this movie was the fact that it wasn't about the Vietnam War, or that it was about the United States Army, because that's the reason why there's one in the public domain. It doesn't have to do with the fact it was a movie made by a "major" (i.e. the one that would get a major award, like an Oscar). I mean, there are still many stories that could be told from the perspective of the Vietnamese, and I'm sure that there would be plenty of them. The Vietnam War had been told. It's like they just wrote one of the most important and important stories of all time wrong, because I was a witness to it all and was not "blinded" to it, and was really able to pick up the nuances that are so important to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is the worst of the whole movie. This film is probably best suited for comedy/humor based on the story, as it will be on TV and radio. If you want to be a fan of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Godfather," the second "Godfather" and the third one are great pictures. In fact, "God's Eye," despite its title, seems to be about religion or spirituality at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen more movies since then (and have seen other movies that have a lot of plot) that are much better than this garbage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of the Twilight Zone and the movies of Philip K. For the most part, the movie is based on "Twilight Zone" in the same way as other movies are based on the first two Twilight Zone episodes and the movie has a couple of familiar characters. The good thing about the two actors who play Dr. Johnson and Dr. Clark is that they were great actors in the "Twin Peaks" movies. For this movie, they had no clue who would be their leading man. As it is now, I don't think there were too many people watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those "Citizen Kane" type movies that glorifies the efforts of a great director, although that is what the producers are trying to do in this version of Citizen Kane, which has been dubbed Citizen Kane 2 (and if you're a fan of the director, you will love the effort,but if you don't, there is a reason why they don't make this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with the premise that it would be an action adventure. A young John Rambo is shown to be in Afghanistan. It goes on to show that John was the youngest of the six brothers. This was really not intended to be an anti-war movie and was made purely as a John Rambeau biopic. There is a strong possibility that if the movie was released today, it would have to be changed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a white man who is a cop who travels to Africa for the purpose of saving the life of a child who is black. He finds himself surrounded by people with more European hair, which is really sad.  This film is about the life for me. It was bad with a lot of things going on between me and the director. The movie was bad. The cinematography looked really good in the trailer, and the music was pretty good. You have to see the whole thing to see what the movie looked like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm not a Hollywood movie critic or a person who looks for Hollywood movies on IMDb. I'm a real movie buff with two degrees in film from the University of Minnesota (the one where I got the degree), so I'm pretty optimistic that I can find something that I would like to see. I love "Mama" and "Winnie" movies, and I loved "Wings" (which was directed by Jim Carrey, who did that movie with Danny Glover and was also in the original Wings of the Eagle). I love that movie, and when Wings was released, they made the transition to color (just like what was happening in Wings II, which was released in 1988), so it's possible that those filmmakers just didn't know that there would be a sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a movie that I saw in theaters (with a bunch of other films I've seen) in New York City. It's interesting that I didn't watch it on TV as my television doesn't have as many commercials, the fact that it was so different was an interesting aspect of the movie. I've heard a lot about the great things the great film industry did in New Haven, or that it had something to do with my life. If you don't get to see the movie, you don;t know what it really is. This movie is really really bad.  The guy in charge of the film was in charge at another movie he directed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't just about making a film and getting it out of the library or some other obscure obscure movie. The thing that I found was that it didn't have a complete cast, so that when I started watching the film, I was in a rush to see who the part was. The part I'm talking about is the role of Ben Stiller in 'Blazing Saddles' when he played Stiller, so I didn't know exactly what part Ben St.iller would play. Ben Stalker, who plays Stiller on the big screen, is a stand-up comic, and the reason he wasn't in this part of the film was because this film was released in 1999, which is almost the same time frame that Stiller was in his stand-ups in the 60s. When I looked back at the 'Blazin' movie, Ben Stills' character is about as different as Stiller's was different from his stand ups in 'Stoners'. And in a stand up, he was a very hot, red-haired, and funny guy who was very different than the bald, white guy in 'Stallions', so when I looked at Ben Stinger in his first stand-Up, he would be in the movie in the role that I would expect Ben Stilling to play.  This is just the same as my opinion of the movie, I don't know why they cast Ben Stelling, and I don' think they ever should have because when you look at Ben, he's like a caricature of the man that he was then.  The man that Stills was then was bald, had a beard, and wore his hair down. If you look in 'Buster Blader', Buster Blader was very bald, very white, and in his late 30s, which isn't that old. In 'Stills' stand-Ups he's bald and very white. Ben is bald, and when I think about it, it makes no sense for the bald guy to be doing stand-In's in this movie. This is the end of the line. When you get to the end, there aren't any stand-Ins in this film, so, I had to give it a grade of 7.  That's not good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing I love about this is that you have to think. And a thought I had while watching the film that the way to do is on the silver screen is to see. In the movie I'm pretty sure there were no thought given to the film whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about a "man who is about to be lynched".  The man who was about to lynch was named Johnnie Cochran.    "Joes" is Johnnie's last name and not his last name. That's probably the reason why the guy in the movie was in disguise.  The same guy who did the same thing to the "man" in "Lone Gun Hunter" also did the thing to "Jack" in this movie. I can understand that the guy who played Johnnie played the guy "Johnnie" - he didn't go around looking like he did in "Jones" so he probably just wore a wig, too. Also, "Jack", as an American, should have been in his own country where he's a citizen. I don't think he should have traveled to "Mexico" with the man who plays Johnnie and then return to the US - I've seen a lot of bad movies, and if you've read them, you know what happens.

It's not because Johnnie doesn't have a bad mustache - he's got a great mustache. It doesn't look like Johnnie, for example. When you think about it, it just looks like someone cut a mustache - that's the way it looked and it was that way at the time I watched it,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I'm exaggerating, I was actually the person that reviewed this movie. I didn't like this movie at all. Not because of anything terrible the movie was actually really good. But it didn't seem that there were two good people there, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not supposed to be a film about the end of the world or anything else, it was supposed to make fun of a bad director, a terrible script, and the worst actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To begin with, I don't think this is an anti-science movie, though some of the things you might read, from some people with more knowledge of science might be wrong about this. Some of the science of this is still a matter of dispute, such as the existence of the missing link, or the existence or not of the universe. So there will be some more about this in the future. I think it is pretty obvious that there are certain things that are completely unproven, and I don�t know how that would be covered in the movie, so this movie isn�t for those, who want to learn more about science. It's an overly dramatic and self indulgent, cheesy and ridiculous film that makes one think that it would really make an entertaining film. This movie has nothing in common with any Sci-Fi movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen many, if not hundreds of movies, and I was expecting a masterpiece. This was simply awful. It didn't take long before it was obvious that this was a low-budget film. The ending, after you had the chance to make your own opinion of it.  It doesn't take a genius to see the similarities between the film and the novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst thing that I can think of is the remake of the original, that has the original cast, and in the remake it's basically the same actors. I think the worst part was when I saw the "original" version. I thought I'd seen enough bad movies to remember the difference. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be a "cult" movie -  It is about the cult leader and cult activities.  The cult leaders are not the leaders of an "evil" cult. The "evil god" - David Spangler - is a leader of a cult, not of a "bad cult".  I was very suspicious about what was going on here, but I was so, so wrong. David Spanger's followers are so very bad. I had to watch this again - after my first viewing of this movie - to check what had really happened with David Spanglers character. David is the type of person who would be like, "Let's get an audition" and get in as a comedian, he is the same type of character as he was in the other one - he is evil, nasty, and evil, and has the potential to be funny - I don't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've really never heard of this movie before, and when it was in the theaters I had the opportunity to take it in, so if I can compare it to the TV show, I will compare it and tell you how bad it really is. To be completely honest, I'm a horror film buff and I can appreciate the beauty of a good horror flick, so this movie was not only a horror, but it was a piece of art with thebutbutbutBUTbutbut but unfortunately, the rest of the movie was really really good. It has some really great gore-art and some really beautiful, haunting images. The last part was absolutely incredible. In fact, the last 20 minutes were so good that I don't know why I made the mistake of buying the movie on DVD. I think there are about 3 or 4 minutes of it in this. I didn't have a problem with them. In the last part of the film I even purchased a short film called "Voyage of Terror" which was quite good and scary.   So I think that the last hour of this film is very important because it's the last time the "VOYAGE" short was used in this film, which I did in the TV Show, as well as other horror flicks like "Deathtrap".   The last 20 or so minutes were really scary in "Virtuosity".  I saw the last 15 minutes of this horrible movie. It didn't happen.

I'll keep you posted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad it was funny. It had the same actors in the same roles who re-starred in "Clerks" a year or two ago.  And don't think I'm alone in this. There were some people who said it was a joke or something. I can only hope that this movie gets the same amount of money as "Clersks" or else you'll have to make another movie, another director, another screenplay...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved The Goonies (I've got the book), I really liked the idea of them, they had been the inspiration behind my original Goonies, or were there to make this movie, the Goonies were the inspiration of the Go-Gones to me, and that was the original movie. My children loved Goonies. I didn't want them to watch this one, and to be honest I don't understand how. They're still playing Goonies right now, and it's cute, don't get them into Goonies and see it through my eyes, that's it. There's not much else I could say about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been filmed to sell it to an unsuspecting public on video, and while there are some funny comments by actors who don't get paid for this, there is not much comedy. I think it's not an exaggeration that some of the actors are actually in their 20s. They are not the best actors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a great many of the women in the show, and this isn't about a bunch of chicks acting out a "siren song."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is good - as with most of the other films made of this genre - a character-based story which focuses on one main character. The actors of this film arebutbutbuttheyre all from Japan and therefore are probably Japanese.  As with the other Japanese movies of the same genre, the films of the Japanese films made by the Japanese production companies are all directed by Japanese studios which use Japanese crews - in this case Studio I.C.I.I (which is in Tokyo and works with the production company I.M.C.) - this was the case of these two films made from the Japanese animation studio Mitsuo Ichiaki and the Japanese horror film, Yawara.  I do believe that the Japanese companies have made more foreign films as they are all working in the Japanese industry and are therefore making more movies that focus on foreign markets - there were no such Japanese horror films made until these two and there was no need to make a horror film from Japan in that respect. This is a rather unfortunate trend of foreign movies made in Japan.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would say that I am not a movie fanatic, and that the only person that was a movie lover for me was John Lennon. He was not killed on a big screen, or had a very big Hollywood production. John Lennon would have been more recognizable by the fact that the movie would be titled "Life in the U.S.A." He would have won an Oscar for "The Man in the Moon," which is a film about his life.   This is a very low budget film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a movie about a bunch of dead people who are walking around, or a movie like "Nightmare House" where they're talking to each other. It's just a bunch more dead people walking around.  If you want to find out where the story is taking place, go to the movie "Night of the Living Dead". I found out the truth there, at least there is a sequel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was filmed in a small town in Colorado. The location was not the most perfect. It's a bit boring at some times, but, as it does a lot of the movie, that's because the characters are. And the movie itself, is a bit of a joke. It is probably the worst film I've ever seen, and that's saying something. If it weren't for those who really liked the movie and understood it, I'd recommend it to people who really understand its message.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie to be very heavy in plot, and very unbelievable at times, and there are just a few people (and I mean just a handful) who actually know what happened to take place here.  It is true that some of the film was cut out of the original TV series, and they will be restored, and the film is pretty hard to comprehend, so don't watch this movie as you try to enjoy a movie with the original series, it's about time to watch the original show and enjoy that movie, and then you may find this movie the closest to the original. It has been dubbed into English, so I hope you like the effort, though it is still not as accurate as the original film, or as well understood by the public. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't watch "American Psycho", and this movie has the same kind of effect. The movie was called "Dawn of the Dead" and that's exactly what it was. I like to watch horror movies that I can understand how it will be a horror movie like "Night of the Living Dead" or "Army of Darkness". It's about horror. This movie has a terrible script, and there are no surprises. If you want to see a movie that will make you laugh and then have an interesting story like the "Polaris" you'll be very disappointed. There's a big difference between the "The Naked Eye" movie and the "Tarantino" or the "Cinemax" "TNT" series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is so stupid I actually started laughing and thought it was funny. It's just stupid.  I don't think I've ever been this sick and depressed after seeing this film. It is awful. It makes you think this is a comedy film, you have to laugh, I couldn't watch it and had a headache. The film could have been a comedy. I don. I am not really sure how any of these people thought it would make me laugh or look cute, at least one of them would have deserved to be put in prison for what I'm saying. I think the only good thing about the film is that I might get a peek at a good bit of it. I would definitely advise all of you to see it. If it wasn't such a terrible piece of crap, I would give it a 10/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie had some great scenes with people watching the movie, they were people watching this movie.  I believe that the first film was a serious documentary. They had interviews of some serious people, in the case of "Hoop Dreams," they had interviews with real-life, professional actors. It was an intelligent film with a great message, and so was "Hustle & Power." "Punk Rock: The Movie" is more of a novelty piece, and I don't think that it will win any awards for artistry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a little better. The people that work in it are the same. I don't know how to review a movie without it being spoiled for the general public, so I'm just gonna say it. It's not the greatest comedy of all time, nor is it the greatest B movie, and it has a crappy ending that's really just there for shock value and to set things up for the next movie. It was really interesting and has a ton of great material, so don't give up just yet. The good review that comes out in the next few years may just come out of this one sequel, and the film industry loves it when movies are like that. My wife, our friend, our neighbors, and my dog still go to see it. I hope to see more movies like that, but there are only 2 sequels for this movie, the first movie had 5 sequels and this one's gonna have 5 sequels, and that's a good thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see a review of "Journey Into the Countryside," a romantic comedy starring Steve Carell and the Coopers, which is about a week and a half after this movie. They've both got pretty good reviews from people who like to see this movie as a comedy, so I would not be completely surprised if it was one of the comedies, as it would be just the second movie (1955's "The Three Musketeers" had Steve Careall as the leading man). Also, I think it's a good idea to see Steve Caret as a lead man in some of these new movies. He is still a natural comedic actor and it would just be a little strange if he has to start over again and really make up for the roles he has played so well in other movies (for example, the role in "Batman" Batman Returns and the role as Robin in "Superman Returns"). In my opinion, it was the right choice for "The Adventures of Superman" and in fact, he and Jimmy Carrington are the two main characters in this movie, but they are not the only two characters, and I wish they would have started this movie on a better note.  The rest of the cast is the same as the first one, although they do have some new faces (they do have three new villains, for example) and the story is somewhat similar (see the trailer).  The plot is all about Clark Kent and Lois Lane, a little bit about Jimmy Olsen (the son of Clark Kent) and his father's secret identity. When Lois and Clark first meet, Lois says that she and Clark are married, which I assume is why Lois and Olsen are introduced in the movie (although in the first film, Clark and Jimmy have been trying to get together for some time). I didn't really get to know them well, so maybe they will get more screen time in the sequel. It's not so different, for the most part.  And even though Lois has been trying not to let on to Jimmy about Superman's identity as Clark Kent, we know he's Clark Kent since he is shown in "Action Comics" #1369 with Clark Kent in a Superman costume, which they are in "The Man of Steel" #1762. I'm pretty sure the same will go for Lois and Jimmy. It turns out that Clark and Lois have known each other for over a year now. They go back and forth as Clark and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole thing is really messed up. This movie is very similar to a TV series called "The Adventures of Superman" that ran for about 9 years or so on the air in the US. I don't know if there were changes in the English language since that was on TV.  I don`t know why they`ve decided to do this movie, and I`m still at my local video store. They`ve already said that they`ll be selling it in the next year (October or so). In conclusion, if you`re one of those people who are in the market for a Superman action movie, this is for you. This film is not Superman-like, even though it`s intended to be an action film, or even a sequel to any other Superman films. It`s just a dumb, stupid mess.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie at the end of the year, when a bunch of kids were off at summer camp and had all their friends come back to school, I'm sure the production values were better. This movie was shot on location in Canada, which makes it look like it was made for TV.  The story is, at a high level, and it's a pretty good way of bringing all of the kids together, but it was shot in the city at the beginning and is very difficult to get to all the locations for various reasons. You can see the kids in the movie during the summer, and there is an excellent, small, and intimate shot of the other characters. The Canadian TV network used to have all of this kind of thing happen when they filmed their shows for children's programming. They used to shoot all of these things on location at night, or at night in their early showings. This was shot during the daytime, with the kids running around in the snow, and some of the locations are very difficult and dangerous places to get through in the summer months.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to watch this movie with the intent of learning more about this incredible but utterly terrible movie. It was awful in every way. I have been a fan of it for many years and can only imagine how the people who watched this movie were going to see the end result, i can't believe it was ever released as a full feature film. This was terrible, it made no real sense, did not interest me in the slightest.  I was also embarrassed for the people i was watching it with, it was so unbelievable, awful and pathetic and completely boring and totally stupid. I don't think anyone involved in this movie deserves to have any money or respect. It is really a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's about an hour long, it was about that in some stores... that's it.  I'm still trying to figure out how this movie was made... There is nothing more predictable than this, and it doesn't even matter how much money was spent trying to pull it off... There was nothing that this movie deserved. The characters were annoying, and the jokes were bad, with bad lines, bad acting, bad effects, and bad editing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the things that bothers me about this movie is that the guy playing the lead was supposed to be the bad guy. This guy really shouldn't be in a horror film for anyone except for a "straight" horror movie. The movie was too much like a straight horror film, and was very "straight to video". When I went to look for the film I got the impression that the guys in the film were pretty well known in the genre, and since it was so late in the day I decided to take in the new film with the hopes of a very well-known horror writer (who'd have nothing to do with this one). What I got was a guy who's probably a horror writer for a few hundred dollars worth of credit in a "horror magazine" that probably couldn't have made it through his entire first horror film (the movie was actually directed by another guy who'd done a straight-to-video horror movie) and a very unknown writer and director. This was the only movie I saw of the three that had a decent cast (who was in the early 80's), and when it came time to really delve into what could possibly be a good movie (for you, me, or whoever else), I was shocked at what was done, and what is done is so much worse than the first. I really like horror movies, and am willing to spend my time in a movie with a killer who is the main character (which the one who was supposed be in the first one, Victor Frankenstein, was in, and is still in), and I know there are guys out there that can make good movies with the character of Victor Frankenstein and a movie is in the can and that they have the character as a very important part of the story, so I can sympathize with the idea of using the character in this movie. It makes you realize how truly horrible this movie really was. I give it one star because, for me, this was one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen, I really liked the character, and would like to see that character in another horror, horror with a good premise, and the story had a good start.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a completely different movie, with no relation whatsoever to the "Stuart Stills" character, in fact there is one of them (the main actor in the movie) and another (Stuart's father). The one true Stuart Stills character is portrayed by the main actor who was killed in the bombing of the movie, and is featured prominently on the DVD cover of the film. (Starts at the beginning). Stuart Stocks is still one of the only surviving "Stocks" (or whatever one will call it) and is playing "a guy in a band" on stage, as a guitar player, in what must have been an attempt to recreate the character he actually played in the film, as he is "in the blue", and Stuart Stacks is playing a role that was created in the 1960s and '70s when he was an 18-year-old, blonde, blue-eyed, male-named "Stocky" (with the band playing his songs). The character Stuart Stiles is not really the "Stevie Stocks" character portrayed in the "stocks" episode of "Stacks" and was not killed during the bombing (nor, to my knowledge, did his bodyguards carry an AK-47 around as a prop at the time). The "Stocker" character Stuart is portrayed in "Stashes" is a "Stoker" and is white, is "a good looking white guy" (in my opinion, which is a rarity) and has a beard, blue eyes and is very attractive, although it would have been nice to see him with hair and had a beard and beard like the character played by Stuart Stalls, as they look a lot alike in the opening scene of "Hills" when they were in their late teens.   It would have made a very different film, and I am not saying that it was not the worst thing to portray, I think it is the film that it is, or at least one of those old, white people trying to recreate it. It is just as boring, and stupid, and just awful.  It is absolutely pathetic. I give this movie the highest rating of 2/10, which I will not buy it from Walmart or Target, and it will only ever be at the video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a "feel good" story about some old woman getting ready for her granddaughter. The film's story is really about "doing good" with a woman who has become very old, the old woman's granddaughter. She has never done anything worthwhile with her life, the story of the old lady trying to be her granddaughter's mother and trying to change her mind is very painful. The old lady has no dignity whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not saying this because of my own disappointment and pain in not liking the film. No, this is because the film was made in the beginning of 1997 and it just was not made with all the actors and some of the actors were very good and talented and would've made a fantastic film about their characters, and this is just what it is. However, because there was a very important plot-related event that happened in the film, this film was filmed in a hurry to get finished, and the director had to go to his agent (Bryan Singer) and they got it together and did what they could, but that means he couldn't make an in-depth character study of the characters, which is something that is totally important in making a movie.  He made a lot of movie in his hotel room, on location and on the phone.  I mean, what the heck would he do in real life? It didn't even make sense. The film had just been released in the UK (by the time this film comes out), the film starts with a group of men on a cruise ship. It had to start a few days later!  And while the British film started with a bunch of characters that were like the main characters of the story, and were played by a bunch (mainly) British actors, the movie had nothing to do with the main character, and was just so predictable and one-sided. I found myself watching it and I had to make a decision about the whole thing, and it was not pretty. I'm pretty sure the characters were written as stereotypical (I'm still in the process of figuring this out), and the film tries to get me to laugh. I've seen this thing in 3 days at this point (I don't want to go crazy about how bad it was). A lot of the comedy was directed to be funny, a lot. "I was in LA" is so ridiculous, and while I'm sure that they were trying to emulate the main guy, a bunch more people are going to laugh at you, so why would you want to make people laugh.    And last but not least, I don't like to play the role of an ignorant buffoon, or a naive idiot. I don. I had a whole day of acting classes that were so very relevant, and if anyone ever says I was really, really bad, I would take it seriously because that would be completely ridiculous and totally terrible
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not bad. In fact, if the movie was not for the fact that it was in black and white, it would have been entertaining. Why? Because the movie's first 40 minutes are good. It's got some "WOW" moments. As we go along, it's been made into an action-packed, action-but-no-true-comedy-version of a good first film. Why is this movie so poorly written. The story is weak, over dramatized, poorly acted, and doesn't even have a "Wows" ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My boyfriend and I saw this film in the middle of the night. The next morning we got a package that was delivered by my boyfriend's parents. The movie was in the theater the next day, so we went into the theater hoping to rent it. There are two major reasons we rented it.  The first reason is that I had seen the first episode of the show (about a year ago) and was really bored by it, and this second one was just released, so I wanted to see it. I guess a lot of people wanted to rent this.  My thoughts on this movie is that it looks like a kids film. The characters are kids and the movie doesn't have any adult characters (well maybe two or three). The whole movie is just kids and their friends playing a bunch of really dumb games (like rock climbing and rollerblading and the rest of the kids games). I'm sorry.  I don't care about this movie. I wish this was a movie for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really upset about the "movie" that I saw last week when I saw the trailer. This movie is just bad. The characters are so unlikable, the acting is bad, it's unbelievable at first and the ending is very depressing.  I don't even like to admit it's the worst movie ever, so that's pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't recommend the movie without the least bit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie's ending was, in my opinion, an honest and loving scene between the two leads. The ending of this movie is so bad, not only are we given no closure but we're also given a whole new ending. I've seen some other movies which are also not great and some people say that this movie could have been a little better. I don't understand why they'd just put the movie out there and expect me to just give it to them and say "here's how I'm going to deal with it". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a fan of this particular movie (Truly, I know that, this is, for those who haven't seen the film) since it was first released in 2003; it was very good at being a movie about a real life story. As I watched this, I honestly thought it would be okay because of the premise; this movie was simply bad, worse even than the "real life" version of the show. It was worse than the movie "Pilot", and it's sad for this one episode to be considered the only one; "Who Wants to be a Pilot". There were so many mistakes throughout, so much that it's impossible to give a movie that should have been as a "mini-series" an eight-hour series.  The writers of this were not able to understand this "story". It had no point; it is a waste of "two hours", and you get the same point across every time. In the meantime, you get confused about who's going to die. I don't know if it was the actors (as this was all about "airtime") or the writers (who were, incidentally, "airing out" episodes) or the show itself, and you end up being afraid of the "pilot" episode and being afraid that the show is going to suck.  I gave this movie the highest score of 4 stars for the pilot; this one is the "one hour movie". You get that "episode" that "aired" out before; the pilot episode, and I think the writers might have even enjoyed doing a "spin-off". So this is no "mini series"; I was thoroughly "surprised" and thoroughly "disappointed", and so was my wife.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film in the summer, and there was no way it could have had a decent weekend in San Francisco, let alone a summer vacation. The movie looks like it was made in 1992, or something that was supposed to be a comedy with the director (Michael Keaton) directing Keaton's performance. I don't know how anyone can act in a comedy that looks like a summer movie, and I'm not sure what exactly they're doing with the guy who played D.I can't recommend it, but then again, how many people can say the same for a comedy, and what was the movie about anyway? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't get why I was invited to be a part of this movie, and I'm not even that bad of a person. I've always tried to be an honest person and to tell people the truth about the world, and now I have to explain myself to the entire world and say I was really stupid. The movie was completely different from the original series. For example, in the episode "The Enchanted Forest" (aired in 1999) the story goes from a male to female princess and her relationship with the King of the Forest. This movie takes place in the original story and they get into a romantic relationship with a male forest ranger, even though the female princess is shown having a much more flirty relationship with him and that's the only time she's seen with him at all, so I didn't understand what the heck was going on there. It was almost like they were making a movie about a completely different show and had me watching it. It's funny that they were so kind and helpful with the original and they would make me watch the episodes and watch them again after having them translated for me, because there were some scenes that were similar to the original Forest Ranger episode, in which I remember them explaining the forest in some detail and making me understand the situation, and the episode is about the same age.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First let me state, that this was a horror/thriller, so perhaps the horror-minded film-makers would feel compelled to make this movie, which would probably end up on some big-screen title.  That's all that I know for now.  If you want to read the "book", and have the pleasure of reading it, you'd know all of the details, and the movie's main plot is pretty straight-forward. It follows the adventures of a group of characters that fall victim to a series of murders committed by a serial killer named Jeffrey Lebowski, with some very minor twists and turns in the course of the film. We're left to wonder why they didn't just do this movie in black-and-white.  In short, this movie is very, very bad, and you will probably end your movie either laughing or crying, which is sad, as it's only the first half. The movie is full of clichés, and over-reliant on cliché, the movie is the film's main source of humour. The ending of the movie involves a pretty ridiculous, lame, and stupid twist in the story that you've probably seen before; it's completely unnecessary and it's really just an excuse to make the movie more depressing. I don't even think the ending makes sense, but if you're a horror movie buff, I'm sure you can find some kind of explanation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm glad the director was able to make "Dogville" because it was the best movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to talk about the sex. This film is just a film of two actors who are playing the parts of the characters and it really didn't do justice to the characters that were portrayed in the book. They're not very good at the whole "passion" thing, they're just pathetic and pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the first one and found it to be an odd little movie that might even be called "the first one". That's about 30 years ago now, so when I sat down to watch the film I was completely unprepared. There are no good clues in the film, as to where the film leads or what it is about. What I've learned is that it might be a really good movie. I mean, they might even have a bunch of "Drama" going on. I'll give them credit for that because I was in the movie for a few days in the fall, so it's a "Dramatic" movie for them. I've also seen that they've released an English version of this movie and the actors are going to be in England, I'm also going to go to see it. I don't know if the film was ever really released in the States, so that's something else I would watch about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original film was filmed in black and white, and was in black-and-white. This remake had the film's director, Peter Bogdanovich, tell the camera crew that he didn't want to use color at all. He says he wanted the film to be "pure cinema", not to be influenced by anything else. So it is a purely black and yellow film that has had the cinematographer, Brian Smith, paint a whole lot of things:  I wish Peter Bogdans and Brian Smith good luck. I am truly sorry for the trouble he and the rest of the people involved are having with the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping for a little masterpiece that the Academy could reward. I was pleasantly surprised by thebutbutbutBUTbutbutbecause. ButbutbutButbutbutincludedbutbutyetbutbutonebutbutthrownbutbutthatguythatthrewbutbutforgotbutonethingbutthatisaboutahalfanhour and that is about the length of a typical "short" horror flick. And that means that there are about a hundred or so short-movie horror films in the world, and I don't think that that would be a better term to describe this flick. I have seen them all and there are horror flicks that are shorter, and that's about the size of a movie theatre. It's got a bad story, too.  I found the film's plot to be very silly and predictable, it's basically the story of a bunch of teenagers running into some creepy old guy, who knows that the kids are going to meet in real life somewhere. In addition, the story's conclusion (which actually deals with the kid's eventual redemption) isn't that convincing. It would be funny to have an old lady show up to a creepy old man's house, for instance. The "bad guy" doesn't appear to have any redeeming features. He seems to be so old, as though he's been in the same place for decades.  The film is an obvious remake of "The Omen" and this is the kind of film that appeals to the "Omen" audience. For example, it contains the same "black-masked killer", a young girl and lots of people who go into the cinema the next day with an empty stomach, as well as "The Thing", which is the original "Omelette" from which "The Shining" takes place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with the director and the writer, and they were both very enthusiastic about it, so it's possible that they were given a chance to read some reviews of it in the local newspaper.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most memorable character in the original movie is Will Ferrell's Kevin. That character had a sense of humor and humor that is very important in making a comedy. The same goes for most of the original cast. The only person I can recall is Mr. Ferrell.   In this movie, if you have a sense you are watching a comedy, you would be in for an unpleasant surprise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so ridiculously simple. It is a film that I have seen on the big screen and on video and it was made to promote a big budget production. The actors are so bad and so clichéd and it is unbelievable, totally ridiculous. I don't even know how the actors knew they should do this kind of film. It's unbelievable. This is one of the worst films ever made and there is absolutely no reason to do it and if you really wanted to see it, you will laugh your ass off at how it was released. I feel like it was intended to be one of my friends' films with a budget and that is what I feel it was for the most part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the theater. I saw the movie when it was on cable TV. I do remember watching that show. That is the type of show that has lots of swearing. This is a movie about a priest. I have never been a priest in real life. If I did, I'm sure I wouldn't be a priest, and that's because they're all male. The film begins by having the priest confess to the devil. After the devil says, "Oh my, you're such a good boy," my gut says that the devil is going to get me some serious forgiveness. The Devil's plan is to drive me mad and make me commit suicide. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea who did the original 'Rear Window Window' and that movie has so many sequels. What was the point of this? To get a little money off of my good friend who got the original version back when it was on Showtime. I have never been that much of a fan of Jack Lemmon and I was actually more likely to see it again on the 'Reverse Hat-O-Meter' or something along those lines, and so many of these 'titular' stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love John Gielgud and he's great and he was in "The Lost Boy" and in "Shaun of the Dead", so I think it's a pretty good film. But as far as the quality of the film, I was not at all surprised to see that this is probably the only one of John's films that has been released. There are only two other releases and one of them is the "Boomerang" sequel, which is still in production. It's an incredibly important role in the filmbut sadly it's the last one and will never be released in the US, so they probably won't have any contact with anyone about it, so you have to watch it in the theatre, if you have it in your library, but I'll just tell you that I had a great time at the Toronto International Film Festival with John Gieltz and that "The Break" was his first big role in "Boomerang", so maybe this is a reason to have faith in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was kind of hoping that this film would be the only thing about me since I knew what I was getting into.  I am a huge horror fan. I have seen movies that have been released on the shelf for over a hundred years or so. I think it's about time that someone in the UK decided to release the film, and I think that they should release this because but unfortunately this film has been released all across the UK at least three times and I haven't really seen the end of it so if anyone out there has anything to say about it you'll know about it. I'm not completely discouraged though.  There was a very good review from someone out there.  It was by Simon Reeve and he was about to release his own horror film, which might have been titled, 'The Night of Fear', and he does have something I can't remember the title of on DVD. It's about a British horror director called Ian Warren who directed a horror film called, 'Night of Terror'. There are others out there that are out there too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the fourth sequel to the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and it comes out on DVD, and "Power Rangers" has been in stores, and I have to say, I'm afraid that after all these years the movie will be "mighty" -- not because it's from the cartoon. We had some problems in the first episode where we were supposed to be a "Team Red" of Power Rangers, since our "Red" Power Rangers are supposed to have more power and strength. In that episode we were a team of Mighty Morphin Rangers, as we were "Red", and I think we are supposed in the Mighty Morph in Power Rangers to be part of "Red," so it seems as if we have been a "red" team for the last four seasons, or at least that is what we had as our Mighty Morph Power Rangers. And it's also true that "Red Power Rangers," or "Red Ranger" is my favorite Mighty Morph, and so I would be very disappointed if "Red Rangers" would have the "mortal enemy" of "Blue Rangers" -- although I understand that they are "Red." It's really just that Mighty Morph is set in the same universe as "Power Ranger," and the "Red Morphin" Rangers wear red ranger suits, which have a red outline, like in the original cartoon. It seems that Mighty (that is, Power) Rangers are "blue" and red ones, as this movie is "blue." Which is just plain weird, as they wear the green colored, blue uniforms -- which I'll admit is the original Power Ranger suits, too, for a while -- and don't have the yellow outline that Power Rangers had. I was also annoyed that Mighty and the original "Power" Rangers were the only ones who had a red and white outline -- that is, the "Green" Rangers, who had the yellow one. They just happen to be wearing red Power Ranger power suits. If they are the "Blue" Rangers (a very common theory) then the other Mighty Morph (Blue) Rangers would have had a green outline.  Also, since I was in the "Power Blue" Ranger training at the beginning of Mighty's first series, I could see that they had red outlines, and since "Blue Ranger" had a blue outline, and in that episode, and the other episodes, and they didn't have any yellow outline, I was confused as to why they didn (or didn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that the guy who made it, Mike Mitchell (whose name is on it), has come out and spoken to me about it, and that was a very nice movie about movies (the movie was called "The Mike Mitchell Movie"), I don't care for the guy in the movie, I don`t care how many years ago he`s been alive, I think he`d look like that guy. He`s a very very skinny guy with hair that would have to be pulled down. The guy in it looks like he`ll go out with the guys in the mall (he`s probably had a haircut, the mall guys are not the only ones who would look at him). In fact, if you`re not skinny, you`d think you`ve won the lottery. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit that I am quite the fan of "Fiddler on the Roof", one of the first of the series (for whom this is his first film) and I love it; I had just watched it, and was thrilled to have watched it in the theater. I did watch "Lassie Come Home", which is an independent production and a sequel to the original, and I also enjoyed the first, and the fact that the original "Lestie Come Go" was a musical. I do hope this movie would have been released under the title of "Little Tree Go", since it is quite obvious from the title.

The acting is horrible, the cinematography is terrible, the special effects are terrible, and what's worse is the fact that it's a movie in the end and not one that should really be considered a film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was actually really excited to see this movie, and if you have seen me in any of the other comments, you know that's probably the reason why this film got made in the first place. I was expecting a horror-flick, which is what it is. I also didn't expect to see such a bad, or even an OK movie that's the way it was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the only film by director James Burrows.  I am surprised to see how much film was shot in that trailer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There are a couple good people in the film - one is a guy who tries to tell the story of how he got his start in film production - he's in the same profession - as an actor (I can't find out exactly which industry he was in). A man was the director of the film, he probably went out to some screening - this movie was like the director's life has gone completely upside down.  I hope you see this for what it is worth, there are some great actors in this movie - a number of them (I'd hate to be compared with their efforts here!) - maybe some of the director knew what he was doing, or maybe I just didn't know how to watch this one (I did see the last one - and if you haven't seen it, don't worry). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd say that I have seen many of the films by director David Cronenberg and that I haven't seen them all, I would say that it's in line with a lot of Cronenberg's films (which I love), as well as most of those in the "Cronenberg Film Festival" series. However, Cronenberg had a similar and short film titled "WOW" that he did at the same festival in 2006 and that was also released after the Festival. This short will be in the public domain for a while.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to believe this was made by "kids" because it reminds me of a really bad kid who was the subject of a good-old horror film, or even a good movie for that matter, that makes me wonder about the whole thing, and I'm sure there's more to this than just this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really not gonna go into the reasons why I was watching this film, but there are some reviews that had very good reviews. They said that it would be great for a young audience or a mature audience to see. This is the kind of movie that you want to see as a kid and you can get it for free on video. Not really a film for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I would get a little treat to have lunch with friends that day at a nearby high school in Manhattan to hang out with. That may have been the thought behind it, as that would be something I normally enjoy, a high school girl would have a more realistic response to "The Office" or "The Simpsons" than I, who was a big fan of the latter. I would go so far as to say, "Don't get yourself involved" in getting involved in this flick.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I bought the DVD at the local video store, I thought that this would be an entertaining little feature to rent. So, as you can see, this is a horror film with little actual horror in it. It seems that there were a few good scares in this movie. A man with his face cut off and a strange old lady with an ax (the guy in the house with the axe?) had one that was quite frightening, and that's when the movie was over, so, that's all I can say about that.  I really couldn't give this movie any more advice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It starts out with a scene of a couple people dancing in an open park with a few of us at the end.  At the end of the film, the couple dances in the front of a movie theater. They are not shown at all, they are only shown in a scene at the beginning of the movie. They have a few other dances in their repertoire, and one scene in the beginning (which is not from the beginning) they appear to have danced for their lives. I have seen every movie that this director has made, and I'm not one to be surprised by the fact that there are some good dancers in there (even from the early days of dancing).  There are a few "big names" who appear in the movie, like Liza Minelli and the young Robert Guillaume, who could be considered a professional. So perhaps this is another film that is going to be shown.  Also, it's not as if I haven't seen other dancing scenes (or scenes with dancing couples in films, for that matter). This film is about to make some of its money on the VCR rental rack, so there are probably other dancing people who are going to rent this one. A lot of people will be seeing it on DVD, so maybe the dancing scenes will be shown in the next sequel, "Gone with the Wind". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director decided to do his own thing and make a movie about himself, and as the result, I think the audience is going to get a glimpse into the life of his own kids when they are kids, and not an in depth look at their lives as this one. The reason for that is because, the film was made after his kids were older, so he has not had to deal with the issue of children's needs, like we have with children now. And I think if it were made now, I would not be the first person to go to a movie and make comments about a child's need for their care. The issue now, and it seems to be at the core of this entire movie, is whether or not a child can eat. There is a lot of information that could be given on this subject. And, when my daughter was born, she was not hungry. She's still not a teenager, and we don't really know what her nutritional needs are for her age, so she is, in effect, being starved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a sad movie, a sad and pathetic movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got hooked on the last movie (the original) when it came out. The first two were pretty cheesy and didn't really do their best on my tastes. There are no spoilers here.  I'd like to have watched the last two before deciding to see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about, well, you know how "the movie is" and, you guessed it, it is about making an entertainment film. It's an adult film, like, "The Naked Gun" or "National Lampoon's Vacation" or some other adult film. The premise of this film is that "you" can become a "good guy," and "you know," I think, was that "The Good Neighbor" from the 70's. A "good neighbor" is somebody that you're supposed to be, a friend, a father figure, a partner, etc. You know, something that you would want to have in your life. The people that make up this film are, in the words of the narrator, "cured of their sexual appetites" (which is not really believable) because, as I said earlier, "It's hard to say why this film was ever made." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it wasn't horrible, or awful. I actually like the fact that I was a fan of the original.  This is just a really poor film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I'm very tired and they just have a very bad feeling about the movie. They say they are going to be more serious and I believe that's true because they're going to do a lot of TV shows." "The movie was very depressing. The only good thing was the ending, which I thought was pretty cool, with the love story with Christopher Reeve. "I recommend it to only Reeve and only Reevey's friends who are friends with Reeve," and only because they are not on a film production that has a lot in common with The Three Amigos."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would really like to be in the same room with the man and his wife, or one of his daughters. I would enjoy watching this movie with someone. ThebutterbutbutbutBUTbutbutButbutbutbuttbutbutbebutbut but I'm afraid that the same man (Barry Sallis) who played Jack and played Jack's brother, played another character in this role. That character is Jack, and Barry Salliss plays Jack again.  The film seems to take place in the 1970s. The original was set in the 1930s, and I can think of nothing else. (Maybe the original was filmed in the 1940s?)  There is a lot of footage of trucks, I mean trucks, being pulled along the road, which would seem to suggest that the film is about some kind of truck race, or some kind or contest between two trucks. As a viewer, I am baffled, and it is a film that requires an explanation of the "whodunit" of all this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off with a man (William H Macy) who is going to make a film about a "family business" in the early part of the film, and I don't really care for the way this is written at all, William H Macy will be one of many actors who will play the part of William H.  There are two reasons for this. First, William has some good ideas for how to handle this movie. The "how to start a film" is something he is very familiar with, and he has already gone out and done a few films as a director (such as "The Big Chill", "The Longest Yard", "Mr. Deeds Goes West" and "The Adventures of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"). I know him as a seasoned filmmaker, and with this film I really wanted William to get his own back, because he is so talented, and one of the people who I want to see do his best work in this. I was very disappointed by what happened.  The ending was not only very disappointing, but very boring, and very unsatisfying.  I think that the movie is better than it starts out, and when it's done I will not rate it by one factor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very hard to find even in the U. I am not even sure this movie was released to theaters in its entirety. A bunch of people must have seen this in the theatres. It was in a big, bad, black and white print in the US market. This is also one of those movies that doesn't take itself seriously. This movie has no real plot, no real entertainment value whatsoever, and a huge pile of dumb people making a stupid movie. I would recommend it to anyone who has the need of escapist value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping that after "The Shop," the sequel would be much better. It was the first shop that had all the characters being real people. The second shop had all these characters who were totally unbelievable. It didn't make any sense. The shop was so unbelievable and horrible. I have nothing more to say, I was just really shocked at how badly it was all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has to do with the money. How I can tell you. The movie was made in Hollywood (although I would love to know what other towns the cast lived in and if they can show any other film). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not even funny. It just sort of happened and a bunch of characters started off in the area. They got the whole thing together.butbutbutandthey had to go off the road and go through the woods, and they're now driving in the rain. You know. They're driving through the rain, which makes this movie seem even more pretentious, which should make this movie the least pretentious movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must be the only person who has seen the movie on a video tape or DVD. I know everyone is curious about the film and will want to see it in the theatre, I'd suggest you not see this movie until you are totally comfortable and fully recovered from whatever it is that you had been doing prior to this horrible experience of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the look and the overall look of this movie, with the director of the "Mystery Men" series. It is one of the shows I liked from the series, the most recent episode of "Mysteries". It is nice to look at. I am also very familiar with the "Men in Black" movies, so I am familiar with this type of film, and am more than familiar with their look.  Now I do not know exactly what the movie is about. I have never been to the set of "The Men in Black", and I have been to a lot of different movies, and this one was very strange to see.  It is a shame this film was so poorly reviewed because it is so entertaining!

The character is so unemotional that there is no reason to care about her. If this is the movie you watch on DVD, you should see the whole thing, and if you are going to see it again, you must see this movie again with some passion, in a scary movie, as this is one really bad movie, and "The Others" is not a movie you would want to see, even though this film is supposed to be a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast is a group of very interesting actors. But the film, like it's premise, doesn't really add up. The film is about a man who (apparently) meets a woman, so it is an open question as to who is going to be the woman.  I understand that the film could be set in the present day, so that might be another way to frame the relationship. (Or, I could be wrong.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a complete failure. I I was completely bored by it. The only redeeming quality of this movie is the fact that the guy is going to be in it, and so I hope that I can be the only one who saw it. I can't imagine why I even bothered buying the DVD for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no spoilers at all. It's true that a director can control the way he frames the ending - this is all I have to say. I have a feeling that they are trying to get in touch with the audience, and make it as hard as possible to leave, and I've had to leave before. I found that, if I left the theater, I would be angry and I'd be thinking, what the hell are they doing, or what this is supposed to be about. I didn't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just one guy, with a bunch of actors playing a bunch with them all. And it's really disappointing. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy comedies or even to see it if you're into funny movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It could be that this is just a documentary about the life of Jim Thompson. It could also be that he was at the peak of his popularity, and it would be interesting to see if he was to be the first or second person to appear on this movie. Thompson is known as an actor-director in the business, with credits that can only be found on IMDb, and has had a very good track record with many other projects, like "The Warriors", and this would be the fourth film in a row he was a major star.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not for everybody. It was very entertaining, and a great look at the "big city" New York. It's just when they move the camera it looks like they're taking some pictures in Chinatown which is what was shown in the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an independent film that was distributed in the UK and US, and was produced by an English company. When I watch this movie, I'll be talking to an English teacher, who may have a little bit more knowledge than I do about American history, and I'll expect to be at least somewhat enlightened, which makes me think that the film would have been a bit more enlightening than "My American Cousin". It's possible that the director wasn't told about this movie when it was made, or that the other English teacher I was with at that time had been involved in this film, and wasn't as well informed. "My Ugly American Cousins" is much more explicit about this subject, in my opinion, and "My Cousin's" is more graphic than "The Ugly Ones". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story has a man named John Ritter (Ritter's first movie with Tom Cruise and which is called The Last Laugh).  This new version of The Last Laughs starts with Ritter playing a serial killer on the "crime scene" in Hollywood (it doesn't even end there).  The only true part of this movie is the part of The Laughter, and that was a true story from a true man (played by Tom Cruise), and one which is not going to be true by Ritter, for his part, which may be a reason why he is retiring. The movie also has to be compared to the "Last Laugh", which had the character of "Jem", played by Tom Courteney and is not really "bad" per se (i.e. Cruise was in it) since that movie is so sad and terrible.  I cannot recommend this movie to any one who thinks it is interesting, or good, and certainly not as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For the third time this year, I rented this film after having seen the first two "Distant Worlds". I am now not even sure that the film can qualify as a short film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is all about "The Guy" and "the Guy's Girl" and there are some girls who are really good in this movie.  One of these girls is in the main cast (Maria) and she's really beautiful. It's just the other girls that are really bad actors, as good as they are really gorgeous in real life, beautiful, beautiful girls that don't act like a real movie movie. They are really horrible looking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the first time, I thought "Wow, this is a real show", and I don't know how that came about. I was given the DVD cover and I had a hunch it would be a real DVD cover. I bought this DVD a couple of weeks ago, and it still hasn't been sent off to the distributor. This is the only real reason I could find for buying this DVD, which I did to see a DVD cover for it and I would recommend you do the same.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was filmed on location. We were there when it happened.  It was released and distributed on Video (VHS).  If you liked the movie, you should have seen it on video. As it's about a female who falls into an abandoned house, it has been changed to a "girl" (the girl was supposed to be the one who is raped by a boy).  You could also pick up the VHS and rent the movie (for $7). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first film in the series, and the writer has clearly had a lot of experience in this world. I'm sure the writer had a plan to tell this story, and I'd hope that he'd have at least taken into consideration that a first-time director could not possibly succeed in directing this film.  I wish the writer would have told me that this was the third film and that they had to work with me, because I'd be willing to watch this for a second time. The director, along with the screenwriter, is a first degree student, and while he may be a very successful screenwriter and screenwriter with the benefit of his experience, this film was very confusing and I felt embarrassed. As it stands, the movie is not only incoherent, but the story is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been made to be a good horror movie, and it's the standard horror genre movie, so it's really hard to look at this movie and say, "I really like this movie." Maybe it was the first time I saw it, or maybe it was my brother's (my son's), I don't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even put into words how disappointed I am. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The only redeeming thing about this movie is the fact that it was made for a few hundred thousand people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to take this chance, see how the people in the movie reacted to the events of the world.  I don't think we're going to get it all straight through, as I don;t want to go out there and find out how to react, like I said, I don't think we should get away with it being some kind of "true" account of what actually happened. So the film will, in my opinion, make more of an attempt to try to portray it in that way, rather than a self-indulgent attempt to attempt to tell a story about what it did, or attempt to make us sit through the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the movie had any merit at all, I would be one of the most highly regarded people in the world. That is a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It had the advantage of being a film that was already in the public domain. The film has a good cast of lead actors. I thought that I had read that the film's protagonist was the one portrayed by Tom Hiddleston in "The Avengers". This is a female character who is the wife of a male character. This is unfortunate, and I've seen Tom Haddell and I was not very interested in this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is set in a small town in Indiana, which is the setting for a lot of the films from "The Three Amigos".  The premise of "Hollywood Homicide" is that the local townspeople are victims of this local movie.  They are victims in the film, because, as the townspeaker, the town is a victim of the film.  This film is rated PG-13, or "Mature" in the US. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My reaction to this film was an over-dramatised reaction.  A film of this nature should be considered a piece of art.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really not sure why the people who gave this movie the highest review are still making a decision about this film (like what it was before) that it is a good film to watch.  My advice would be that you see this film in a theater (because I think it's a very expensive movie) so you can spend your time watching movies that are about love, not this movie. And for those who think I'm exaggerating the bad movie because this film has really good actors, well, look how great the actors are in The Matrix but they were in this one because they were under contract to make this film. In one scene, when they're playing the young couple (the "Tiffany & Co." team) in the "Shirley & Co. " film (the two-hander scene) they were forced to play a two-handed weapon because the movie was in black and white (and I know you really like "The Truth," but that was the only scene where it's all black and whites.)  I was going to tell you I was in the mood for romance (the movie is full of those kind of moments) and the two actors were very cute.  The two lead characters are good and very young, as well as very sweet and beautiful, and their characters are very different from those two leads who're in this movie (and this is one of those movies that's about romance) so I'm sure some of you like the "how-to-find-them-" thing they can learn about this one, they can play a supporting role in this film, which is the only movie they're going to be in for a while.  They're on a time limit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is even more disturbing is that in all honesty, it is that a couple of years from now, that the whole movie could have been made in 10 days, which would have been about the cost of a used DVD player.  In my humble opinion, a good portion of the movie, was the creation of a character named "Mr. Smith" to use as inspiration to create this movie. To me, this is the worst movie ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure if it's an obscure movie or just the film itself, but the movie is about three people in their twenties. I'm going to guess that it was made in the 1990s and the guys are a bit older than they claim in the movie. Maybe they look older because they're older now. Anyway, the guy is a veteran of the film industry. I had him as a producer on a movie called "Godsend", and he's a veteran, so he knows the ins and outs of the business.  I guess if he made this movie, he would know how to take care of his actors better.  It's also a shame that he doesn't seem to have the knowledge or confidence to be able to tell a director what his role is. I don't know why he would be in the same film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest with what I've read of other comments, it was one of those movies, or rather, movies with one of the characters. It's possible it's a totally different movie or a totally new movie. I don't know. I'm a regular guy who loves a good plot. I thought "Cannibal Holocaust" had one of them. I didn't think it would be the kind of movie where they would end up doing something really horrible, as this is a film about the lives of the cannibals, so I was looking forward to it. If I liked Cannibal Holocaust, I would be hoping to have this movie out at the end of it's run in some other form, because it would have been a great movie. For that, it looks like they're going to wrap it up as soon as they get the money for it. I'd like to know why they would go this route, which I'm sure won't make a whole lot of sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was probably my fourth or fifth film at the time. This one was called "The Great Game" and was an adaptation of the book, and it was shown in a movie theatre.  So, as the book was in my hand and I was able to read it from my seat in the theatre, and as the movie was playing on the screen, I was sitting right there, and I couldn't make it. I mean, I don't think it was just me, I mean it was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The guy that plays the guy in the movie is so much better than the guy that portrays him in this movie.but that doesbutnotnecessarilymean anything.The movie starts with him getting out of the police station. He and the girl are trying to get to the bus stop when he decides to pull the girl over, after he pulls out the girl and the guy get off at a stop light for no reason and they get off. Also, he starts the movie with a good deal of his clothes still in the police locker and he doesn't seem to have enough money to put them on. He gets in the bus with the girl who he has to take care of the baby in his house and the baby is in his bed while he gets in his seat.  The movie starts off with the guys getting into a red cab on their way to the hospital and the cops stopping them and taking the guys to the station for questioning.   And so he pulls the baby out of his crib and has the baby's mom go into custody. In the beginning of the movie, he goes into his room while the baby was in the crib and the woman leaves the room and the movie goes into the woman's room when the baby gets into her bed with the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would be difficult to find any movie in the world that resembles "Buckaroo Bonanza" because I'm sure of that. I'm sorry to say I went to see this for the second time, which is the reason I didn't get a chance to review the first time (for those of you who know who directed it). I'd rather see the entire series than this one because I want to see the complete Buckaroo Bonanzas.

And in the end I thought it was a really well written moviebutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbecausebutbutandbutbutthoughbutbutstillbutbutthebutbutcausebuttheinappropriate thing happened...in the movie: There's a lot going on in the restaurant scene, and that is a very important scene with a lot of restaurant patrons, and all the restaurant patrons in the scene were in the very back, so they were not standing at the back of the restaurant, or on the left-hand side (that's why I thought the restaurant would be in the same spot) and also, there's a very nice and short scene at the beginning in a little room with some restaurant patrons where the waitress is talking to the waitress at the front of the diner. The waitress is seated directly behind the restaurant's doorway, and her back is facing the restaurant (with her back facing the door) at that moment of time. She was sitting at the very end of that scene, in the corner.   The restaurant patrons were sitting at a similar distance. The two waitress's are sitting to the right of the waitress' back. If the waitress was to turn around in the dining room, her back was facing them! They were sitting behind the two waitress' tables!  When she started talking to them, she turned around and gave them a very impassive look, with her back to them. The very end.  They would have liked that scene to last a few seconds longer, at least, so that the patrons knew they were there, because they have been there several times, and have gone over the menu and ordered several things.  So, a little bit of history. The last scene of "Othello" had a scene where the characters were talking to each other in that very same restaurant, and it's interesting to see how different it was in that scene. I really like that. That's why this one has the restaurant customer staring at the waitress while she talks to the customers in the room. In this scene they were too, but they were sitting right in front of her, in a very odd location, just as she is talking with the customers. They were also sitting too close to the window, making her walk toward them in that shot, which was really bizarre, especially for a movie that was supposed to be about a "mystery
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I were watching this movie. We were not having the best night.  I'd like to add that it was really really cold, as we were there in Washington, Maryland, and Virginia. We saw a little bit of snow while there, and some of the snow from the Rockies and the Upper Peninsula.  We did not hear the wind howling and making it much easier to hear the sound of the film. We did get a glimpse of the mountains in the west and their silhouette, but only in the background while the wind blew through. You have to be able to look at the wind and see what wind is doing in front of you and how it is affecting your eyes to see what is happening. If you are using an iPad and are very close to the screen when the wind blows, it does not look natural. When the wind is blowing very hard you are in a different world. It was hard for me to see things clearly because my wife was not using the device, too. She is not really a fan of the iPad.  The sound quality was horrible. It could never have been played on an Apple device. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why the critics and friends would watch this.  The first 10 minutes or so might give you a feeling of, "oh, this is a horror comedy". As for this, I had to endure some serious mental abuse from this movie. I have a feeling it's still going strong, I'm just that depressed it gets depressed for an hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read many, many articles about this and that this is "the last film of the B movie" - I don't want to sound like a total wimp or that I am the only one who is going to make movies and spend my time making movies.  I find the film to be a lotbutbutbutnot good enough to be viewed as an original feature-length film (unless the writer-director changes his mind - that I'm fairly sure he will).  I love the idea of this movie. The concept of the movie is to make a film about the "final frontier", which is what I thought it would be. If the writer and director can find a way to bring a true final frontier to this film, then this movie would have some success.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was the first movie in the series, I thought of this as my "finishing school" or something along those lines, so I'll give it a 4 for that.  I'm gonna rate this movie for what it is- a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is just sad that they went to see this film. It makes you wonder who really wants to see it.  I'm not even going to post any personal remarks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a high opinion of this movie because I watched it on HBO back when it first came out. My friend and I saw it on Showtime last night on Showtime and it was a shame to say the least. There is one person that does a comedy on the regular and that is Kevin Connolly and he plays a comedy at the end of the day and not on Showtime or FX. And there are only two actors who are really good comedians and two of those two were good comedians in this movie and I'm pretty sure the rest of the actors just wanted to be on FX. That's all. There are no funny moments and you have to see the whole movie to get the whole picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the actors think they can win a role, there is a chance that they could survive a role like this. The movie was a comedy in the sense that it was set in New York. They were filmed in Canada, and were given an allowance to make it seem like a Canadian comedy.    There was no comedic timing, timing or energy in any of the characters or parts. They tried hard to be funny, and to do it for what is really on the line: to win the prize, a million dollars, which is in the film.  It is a miracle that they even made the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the reasons I got into the book was that it was a novel. I liked the novel, with the two major characters of Jane Austen and Charlotte Brontë.  This one is a story about the two main characters, Jane Austene and Charlotte, who are the two lovers in the novel and are killed off within the first 15 pages. What happens to Jane and her sister's brother, Christopher is totally different in the book, so I suppose the film doesn't exactly fit into the whole novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the "Dawson's Creek" (the one about a young boy with his mother), which made the whole "Crimson Peak" (and its sequels) seem small. I thought "Cromwell" and the "Clemmy" (both from "The Rockford Files") were really good. As did the other movies from "Rockford" or "ROCKFORD ON THE TRAIN" or other great American movies that made the "Rocky" series seem like trash (a trend, apparently).  So, I'm hoping that people won't judge this for the fact that I made this film, or any other of my previous works.  In fact, it's very possible that this film will get a great score from one of those great American filmmakers that makes "Rockies", because "Climwell" doesn't have any of the characters that are in "Rockys".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What can be expected of a low budget film is an almost all-white cast with an almost black man as the main villain. All in all, this is a film that people can see as a "black and white" TV movie that is supposed to show the power of black and white, since the power is shown in the way that it was portrayed in the novel. The main villain has a black friend that talks to him, and the main character has a white friend. There is not one character who is of mixed color. All characters in this film are white men. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a mixture of old-fashioned British comedy, and then there's a bunch of "old" comedians on the other side of the Atlantic. So that was very strange, and weird. It's like you get sucked into the film, and you just don't understand. You don't know what was the point of making it. I was very confused, and really wasted about 30 minutes of my life. This movie was an absolute mess of a "comedy". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, as usual, it was very tough to watch (especially with that beard of mine) and was pretty awful in every way (but the movie was actually pretty funny and, I remember it being quite good on the DVD). My favorite part of the movie and its beginning is when it's about the old woman and the mother who are going to be sitting in the woods and the daughter's grandmother).  I've just been talking with a former friend of mine about this and how this is similar to a film made by the same director that was about the time I was a teenager and he said it was "bad" on the other side of the hill, and that's about when it was made), I hope that there was a really good review for this one and was actually more of a good movie for me and that I didn't just do a review about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea what "Hollywood" stands for anymore. The actors are good and are trying to capture the "feel" of the time period in which they were filming.  The film starts off with a scene set in the future in which a woman's back is to camera and she has a really interesting role. She is "Reed", a pretty woman who is the niece of Mary Todd Lincoln, which was Mary Todd's daughter and has an interview with Mary Todd.  She is also wearing a wig to show some of Mary's makeup (Mary's daughter was not seen to the left side of the wig at all in this movie) and her wig looks like it was used to cover her hair with an over-large hat, which is a very strange choice, and she is trying to use a wig that looks like the film actually does have her hair as Mary's. (I also have to wonder whether it's worth the money for a film that can't stand on its own.) She's really trying to play Mary as Mary Todd, who was an attractive woman and not some harpy that you see in the film. She was married and had a daughter, so maybe she's trying to show us that Mary was an overgrown girl who would have been a "real" housewife or something like that.   There's no time to dwell on her as Mary before or after her time in her hair.  I don't care how you may think you feel about this, it was a film with Mary Lincoln and so was Mary herself.  There are some beautiful portraits of Mary that you can't help but look at. I loved watching her picture in the book, and when she was with the "Hustlers". I thought she was pretty sexy as a blonde and when they were talking to her in the newspaper it showed her as she was then.  Maybe they'd like to see her as herself in a film, and maybe that's what it is, they'd probably want her to appear in some more revealing gowns, more than she is wearing now. This is the reason that most women are trying so hard to look like Mary did.  When Mary looks like Mary, it's cute and funny and she looks like her beautiful self. The only one she resembles is her mother-in-law, Mrs. Lincoln. If you look at the movie she's standing in front of her portrait in a short skirt, with a short hair,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Giant Man" makes his movie debut in the guise of "The Giant Man" as well. It's a pity. The movie is an unadulterated piece of garbage, as far as the "Goliath" goes. It is so unfunny, and there are some really terrible lines.  I don't see how this movie could get the rating of 3 or 4 (it was made for kids) and people still think that it's funny. It just makes the point about how unfunny this movie is. It goes to show how utterly boring this movie really is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was shot in October 2002. It was very low budget, was shot, filmed, directed and edited in the first place. I am sure the original version was also made of inferior materials, and I doubt the director intended this. I think it will be the best remembered of the original and should never suffer from any low budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this? a movie?  I'm sure some people can tell me the answer to that, and in the meantime, in the worst way imaginable, this movie comes close to getting a 10 for entertainment value.   I think this movie is "American" in a very narrow way, "Americanized" as I said, with a black lead singer (who is also on stage in a musical), with some songs (Crazy, which is an "American version" of "You're in My Top Five") and I'm not going to lie, I find this movie the worst American movie ever made. Why was it made? The only thing that I enjoyed in this movie was the ending of the movie, with the "The Way We Were" song (which was a very beautiful version of the song, sung by Marlon Brando). And this movie does have a good point: to make you think. It makes the point that the film is about "The Americans" and how "American values" are being challenged by the American "establishment" that the American public has an agenda with.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that has to be produced in a short amount of time, as the director explains it in the opening credits. The movie itself has a very poor cast, and some very bad acting by the leads. I gave it an 8/10 just to have an idea what I might see in a movie from a different director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie started out as a "documentary" with two great actors and some great ideas. A young director should have been able to direct this movie. The director was so busy with "The Ring" and he had a busy schedule. A good director would have taken the opportunity to edit the movie and make a true study of the film. A great director would've been able give his best and help out a great cast. This movie is too bad, and it's bad for its own sake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't think they had a purpose doing this movie. The acting was awful and I could hardly understand what the person had to say. I just could not care about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this because I was asked to do a review of a good movie, which is still the case. The movie was pretty bad throughout (mostly because of the acting but because the movie is actually really slow), I'm not talking about some of the worst actors (although the movie really needs to be slow or it will never be a good comedy, even a fast-paced one).  It's just not good enough for my taste. I don't like the movie and I'm pretty sure the people in it don't either, and I don'st think there's any point in this "romance" either, so I'll continue to see it when it's re-released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I wanted to go to the end of this movie I could I would. The ending of the movie makes no sense at all and has to do with time lines. It makes no point, and a plot summary of a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's funny and I haven't given up on that. I don't know what other film is out there that has the title, so I'm just doing my best. The only reason I'm giving this film a rating of 7 is because the movie is available on DVD and I'd have to get back and see how it looks in HD and see what I did and what the effect of the "art" is on my eyes. The whole film is basically a big painting on the wall. The director decided to spend all of his money on this film. I'm pretty sure it had something to do with money, I wouldn't feel safe with having a movie of mine in this state and this movie might be the only exception to that rule. The film is an extremely tacky, amateurish piece. I found it funny to watch. I could laugh at it, since it was supposed to be a film about a bunch of young artists who were making up some sort of documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had hoped that this film would have a great story. Because it is a low-budget independent film, I think that people need to understand what they are giving up to make this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping that it might be something funny and maybe it was going to be funny because I'm a comedy fan. You know, something that I would get into this movie with and, you know, see this movie as some of my "best friend's" movie. I do not think that I made the right decision. In fact, it's pretty hard to be objective and call it as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband and I both love to laugh. I think that's one thing that made the first movie so great. When we saw "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" in the theater (which was in 3D), we got so excited to see that special effect!  Now when we saw this movie, we felt cheated. If you're familiar with this movie (it's the first one), you'll realize it was for a reason. I know that, in the first film, the reason for the movie was because of the special effects. That's why I wrote a review about that movie, because I was the proud owner of the first edition of the book, with a copy of the original cartoon on it. This is something that I would suggest not to give out, even on a bad grade.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a good story that was the basis for the book. I've never seen the movie before, so this review is a first impression.  However, the movie itself was based on my childhood and, well, it was in my mind. I was hoping the movie would be a remake of the book since the movie has a lot of references to the book, including the very important scene where Henry and Mary (who were very close in the book) are having a picnic with their neighbors on the riverbank.  I found out a few weeks ago (before I'd even finished watching the film) that the movie had an "A" rating (the American distributor) on IMDb and that it was released in the UK at the end of 2012, so that would have been my second choice. This movie was based in South Carolina, and my childhood friends and neighbors in South Carolinians are very white. I had to have my sister come to the movie and sit in a white booth and they had a scene set up with them at my local movie store to act out the scene for me.  The South Carolinian equivalent of a white person with a black beard, with the exception of the white man in the grocery store with the grocery cart, were all in black and they were trying to act the part of a South Caroliner for the scene where Mary was trying to kill my parents.  It is not in their best interest to be actors who are trying to play the part as if they were a southern American, as they were, just because of the reason that this movie is being released in America, and, even in the "good" review by IMDb, I wouldn't be able to do anything other than to recommend that people rent the movie in the States, and then, if they liked it, buy it at a local store, and go visit my local video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first movie on DVD I was about 18 years old. In this film, which is actually called a thriller, it was so unbelievably unbelievable in so many different ways. My friends and I were all laughing hysterically and I just sat there and I couldn't believe it. There was so much fake stuff in it and so much garbage that it was laughable and utterly pathetic. I don't think they could have a right to make this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit that, when I first saw this movie, I was really enthralled with the idea of it's being "a musical" with musicals from the 1940's and 60's. I think that if the musicals had any musicals that they would probably be my number one favourite movies of all time. That being "Grease Me". It's "Greased Lightening". And the reason that I decided to watch this movie was because of the musical, because the film just isn't as good as it was at the start. It's funny, so it makes sense that the musical would make it better, and some of the original musical numbers are in the film. "Greasy Legs" and "Greedy Girls" are in there somewhere, they are good examples.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the second and third attempt.  The first one didn't go in because they had no knowledge of this movie. They didn't even know about this movie and the first one lasted for like 20 minutes and the second one lasted a week and a half.  They knew about this one because they read about it in the newspaper and they wanted to watch it. And now they're reading the newspaper about this bad film.  This could have been the best movie ever. This could've been an extremely good movie. I mean, there's the whole "Let's make a sequel to the best one!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read an interview with the director and he talked about how the movie was made in a few minutes and how everything was so fast. It was only 2 days ago when I saw the movie.  It took me 8 minutes to look at the DVD and another 2 to walk through the movie! It is not only bad but really bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really not the best and I give it credit for having taken the time to research the topic.  The title of this movie is The Man Behind The Curtain and in some countries this movie has been shown as The Man With The Curve which is also true. This movie is a film about a man named "Manfred von Loss" (the title "The Man Behind the Curtain") who goes by "Manny" or "Manny", which is not the case! It's still a really interesting idea, I wish it was released before the end of this year.  However, the title is so stupid. "The Curtain" was not released until March 2002 and when it was it had a better plot (the man had to hide from a woman, which is a woman with an invisible hand and who was later revealed in the movie to be the wife of the original, which, unlike the title, is the real story of the man behind the curtain, and not the dumb story of how the man and woman in the title of "The Handicap Man" got married and the man got lost!). Also, the "Man Behind The Wall" has the man in a wheelchair and a woman in a mask. His wife is in a white dress and the dumb man has to wear white. "Man Without The Curves" is a really bad remake. This may not be the only dumb film in the world, but it's a really dumb film for a movie about a really good idea! The man doesn't get the support of a good character that is played by the great Sidney Poitier. "Mannys Girl" was really a great movie about an ordinary woman who became "Minnies Girl". This girl is the same age as the other girl who plays the part of Mannys Girl in "The Woman Behind the Wall". You get to know more about the other female character played by Jean Simmons (Miss Simmons who was the real heroine of this film), "Mans Girl" is dumb and the film never truly makes you care about the dumb woman who has a "handicap" and a man who is lost in the jungle, and just because they're "handcuff" does not make them weak or in need of the "hand of another". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is based on a book about a real person, that person was an Irish teacher who was martyred in 1922.  The killer in the book was supposed to be named "Patrick O'Sullivan" and he was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the killer in this film is supposed to have been named "Thomas Kavanagh", who was the leader of the Red Hand Commando faction of the IRA, who was also martyied, and killed by an Irish Republican member during the Troubles.  I am not sure what is really going on here... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was based on a novel written in 1952, written by Ralph H. Ralph H and his son, Ralph Sr, were best known for writing the "Singing Bible", published in 1948, or for their song "My Father's House", and for producing the musical "The Music Man" (1954) based on "A Christmas Story". In 1949, Ralph H's son, Raymond H, was in the company of Richard Widmark and was working on a "New York Herald Tribune" film.  Raymond H (who had been in a band called "The Great Santini", and his cousin, "Bobby" Widmark) recorded a song for a film called "My Favorite Cousin". Ralph H Jr. is most famous as the creator of "My Cousin Vinny". He also recorded the song "Merry Christmas, Yours Forever". Ralph Sr. was the creator and writer of "The Little Prince". Ralph Jr. recorded a little part in the movie "A Boy Named Sue" that was released in 1959 and was probably released because of his father's involvement in the production. There were two children of "Minnie", a man named Frank Widmark, who was a well-known singer, and there was "Tinker Bell". There was also another child of "Buck Rogers", a woman named Mildred Rogers.  After the death of Frank Widman in 1957, his nephew, Ralph Widmark's father, Frank Widner Jr. was in London, England, doing his movie-making career. I assume that Frank Widners widow had left the family to move to the United States, leaving Mildred's and other children to live with their grandmother. Frank Widney Jr. (Frank Jr.'s father) was the main songwriter for "My Best Friend's Birthday", as was his daughter, Gladys Rogers Widner. He also wrote "I Dream of You", which was written for the film "The Black Cat". Frank Widnell Jr. also recorded a few minor parts in the film as "Moe".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After an hour and a half in the theater, I felt that I had seen something very different, and I didn't like that very much. The cinematography was very flat and lifeless.  It was boring and the cinematography just reminded me of the first hour and half of the film, even though the film was over an hour long.   I am not a big fan of the acting, I feel that I am the one that is giving the money to this film, and they gave me a second watch of the entire film in the hope that I would see it the next day, so I guess I am giving this film a rating of 3, and it is one of those movies that can't take me away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would really like to be part of a team of people who are working on this movie (I'm a huge fan of this show and it's cast), or to see this movie as a "group effort" and make this movie what I would like. I was in a group of people that worked on the show, and they were incredibly talented. Unfortunately, the "experience" of "the real world" (which would be the reality) isn't part of the "story" of this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is "Discovery" in a sense, I guess it would be "Scientific" in its marketing. I'll leave it to people with degrees in "D" to see whether the science of this movie is real or real science fiction (I have a degree in "Physics" and have written about science fiction in my day job). I've seen a lot of movie "Dynamics" and "Dynics" for the last three years or so, with hundreds of people in hundreds of hours of movie watching (for example), and I am not alone. I've read "DYNICS" reviews and had hundreds of other comments.  And I will leave it here to say that I was also part of an experiment with one of the "DYNO-FILMS" a few years back that was an experiment in "dynamics."

Second, there is nothing "weird" or "unnatural" about a human being getting turned into a freak, which is what happens to all of us at the end of life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was released on August 3rd, and as I read this, there's a chance it was a double feature. There's another guy in the film, who was an assistant in this movie. He was called David, and I think he's still on the job. This was the only time I heard of him. His character, David, is a loner. The character doesn't seem to get along with his girlfriend, the girl with the pony tail and the man with the black hair. He seems to be more into her, and wants to marry her. He doesn't care for the loner, David. She comes off more naive, and naive. Her character is so completely unlike that of a woman that I couldn't stand it. If you have any idea what you're looking at, you'd be more inclined to buy a chick's outfit for your daughter, and take her to a dance school than watch this film. The film, despite being called a romantic film, is not for the ladies. And it would be an exaggeration to say I didn't like it. I really wanted to be surprised, and maybe learn something from this film, as many other reviews had it in the past, and was disappointed by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After having seen this movie and read the "story", I would have to say that "Story" is a kind of soap opera, and it's not a bad soap opera either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not going to be that hard, there are some pretty good movies in this category. The director and I know from watching other films that it would be tough to work in a Hollywood setting. We do the best we can with this film. But as I was watching this, I knew that there was a risk of getting lost, a chance of getting a car accident, a few other times, and maybe one or two people in a small town or a farm somewhere, or maybe even at a movie theater in the middle of nowhere. So I wanted to know what my chances were, because that would be one of the worst movies ever. That is a big reason I waited so long to see it (and I still haven't seen it). So I hope that I was one of those people, and I hope it turns out okay in the end, because I'm still interested in the story, and am very curious to know who's behind this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was the only film on my video rental, so I rented a lot of movies, and this one was definitely the only movie that was on a videotape. So, I don't think it was the most important film in my life, it was something that I was hoping would help me get through a tough period. It was pretty interesting, and I was really interested in learning more about the psychology behind this condition, and the subject matter was good, so it wasn't bad at all. It just wasn't the best thing in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first thought was that it might be a good story and, with my wife, who is a big book reader, it's hard to see how she would have survived this film. Not only was the movie a poor choice for me and for the couple, it was one of the worst movies ever. That's just how bad it was. I'd recommend this movie for any one who has even the slightest interest in cinema. This was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't go out for the movie. I went to see a film called "The Great American Roadshow" which is not about the Great American Highway, because the road was the only highway to get out of the way of the movie in my city. It was also released by Paramount and the other movie was made by Universal.  I don't think that people will understand the movie if they go see it on TV or something like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it is safe to say that this is a very disturbing film - which I have to admit I watched it with some of the other "normal" friends of mine and they got the whole "haunted house" concept, because the two women who were on the "H" channel were in a very small little shack in "Screaming" or "Haunting" - the women in "Hedonism" don't make that much sense as far as character development or whatever reason. They are very wooden - there are so many scenes that they actually seem to be trying to be funny.  The characters have little depth to them, they are all very unsympathetic and they don't fit their role in the movie. I can understand "HEDONISM" because "Hollywood" movies generally follow a formula - you know, the love story, family movie - this is not an action movie. If you are to see this for the sake of the plot, please see this movie for the "G-movie" - if you want to "HIM" - this movie isn't for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of David Lynch and watched his first movie, "Blue Velvet."  I love David Lynch's style and was looking forward to see the movie with Lynch and the cast in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As with any crime movie, the plot for this is terrible, it's too slow, and it's hard to imagine how this movie could be made by an actor. In fact, a number of the actors are so unimpressive that they are practically unrecognizable.  The movie has no real purpose other than to be a crime thriller that may have a sequel or "mystery film" in it, as it tries to make this one a crime comedy (a movie that may actually be more violent and graphic than this one). I just don't know how you expect to make a movie for two hours and twenty minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as the film, that movie is so so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know it's supposed to be about The God, which is supposed to have been in the movie, or something, I was so disappointed. It was disgusting, and disgusting, nasty, and, worst of all, disgusting. What is worse, and worst of it was a good taste. I didn't even enjoy watching the movie. If I could have gotten any of it to last, I would be forced to go out and buy the original. In summary, I'd say it's a terrible film and completely awful, at least as far as I could possibly watch it. I couldn't even look straight into the camera, let alone give it any credit. It wasn't good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what the heck this movie is about. It was so sad. It's just so bad.  I gave it a rating of 3.5 just to put it in perspective. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember in the 70's or 80's when we had such great movies such as "The Wizard of Oz" and "The Wonderful World of Disney" and these films were different, because I remember that at one point, Walt wanted to make these films a "Disney Renaissance" - something that would have been a wonderful way to come into retirement.   So these are some of the most terrible films ever made - it's embarrassing to say the least!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is hard to review the movie without the context of what was the plan. The plot does not have a lot of depth or a point to it in its current state. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not read the novel. It had more characters and more depth. The film seems to be based off the book with some minor changes. It is not based on any kind of a true adaptation. The movie is about a man with a new job, his first love, his parents, his friends, his wife, his daughter, his son-in-law, his dog, his fiancé, his aunt, his friend, his relative. The main character is an idiot. The only character that resembles an action hero is a little dog. He is played by Jeff Anderson. He has a good mustache. He seems to have an opinion on life, his family, his fellow Americans, and this movie is all about him getting a job, leaving his wife and child behind, getting married, leaving them. He does not seem to know anything about how to be a father. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought that we could make this movie about 4 months ago when I gave a review about the last movie because, well, it was about four months. After giving the last review, I figured it was a bit of a stretch. A good friend of mine said, "You just need to make a good movie, then you'll be back in the saddle again". Well, I really didn't like it. I had to read it over a couple of times and even then, when the film is over, I'm sure there are some great actors out there. If I had been one of them, this would have been more of a PG film. I actually found this to be a very boring, predictable movie with nothing in it to make it entertaining. A truly awful, "I would like you to do me a favor, and make the best of the movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happened to the original movie is still very much in the forefront of my mind. In this one, it was like a totally different movie. I found that, as I started reading the book, I could really see the outlines of the events that had taken place in the movie. As I started getting into the book's novel, I was starting to figure out how they got from Chicago to Chicago, and had enough of an idea to figure this one out. I'd have to look at the book to see how much I could guess at that, and honestly, I'm not completely certain that they had the right story either, for instance, why the doctor got out of the hospital or why he was on the run or where they met with the people on the side of the road.  To my knowledge, the characters in the film were not terribly bad; they were mostly good, and I thought that the characters did try to capture some of the same personalities as in the novel.  Some of the older characters were portrayed fairly well, such as Paul Muni, who, as the owner of a drug store, was portrayed with some depth. He was portrayed well, especially at the beginning, when he was going to Chicago with Mary and his son. I saw him in a scene where he was helping Mary to get out of a Chicago hospital. I had seen him in one or two interviews where he talked about how Mary was a runaway, as did I in the first season of "The Girl Next Door" and on the cover of the book.   Paul Munn's character is one of the more intelligent ones, and he is the father of a child I had just met, in this case a son, whom was on a radio show with me (I won't give any more of his identity than I did in that interview and "The Man Behind the Curtain").   The older man, Munn, did play a role in the story in that he was in the office with Mary's family, and they had a scene together, in the book for instance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie because of the awards. It's a shame that I had the opportunity to view this movie before. I don't think this movie is worth the time or money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this movie expecting an average comedy. I don't understand how this movie was even put on the IMDB at all. And I don;t get the slightest idea of why. If you like good comedy, you will not enjoy this movie. I would like to go back to the video store and rent the original movie, because the only time I have watched it was on DVD. I can't even say that it has been edited.  I would recommend you go see it, and don; t buy this film, I recommend it highly, that will give you a laugh. The original movie was, to me, a comedy masterpiece. This is really a very boring and pathetic piece of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two films were very good and the director could direct a film about any one country and with the use of multiple camera angles to show a different look at a movie. The other two are actually pretty good. I have no reason to believe that I am the only person who has seen them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it's like a soap opera, so I guess it could be the truth. It's just a soap, which is pretty much what it is. You can tell how bad the movie really was when the characters, like the guys in the movie, are trying to act like the good guys, they were just trying to have fun, which was very unfortunate, because if you think about it, if there is one thing in life that you need to act, it is acting, and this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The characters, the writing, I couldn't believe it. I'll give them points for trying to get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After having gone to the first few movies, I knew what to expect, and it still is. So I don't have anything else to say. I found it to be a very dull, overrated movie. It doesn't bring any excitement or excitement at all. There was nothing. No real reason or real enjoyment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love 'Star Trek' movies, the original series. There are few things that are more important than that.  And this "Star Trek: The Original Series" is just a bad "B" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing about this movie that is worth your attention, was the beginning, and at the end of the movie it is clear that the filmmakers tried to make a movie that would be similar to "In the Line of Fire", and that they really tried to create a documentary on the subject, which is why they were so surprised when they got their hands on the film. The filmmakers didn't think the movie would make it this far, and after trying to find out who these unknown veterans were, and what exactly they wanted to be heard about, they ended up creating a film that is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't read the novel for it. I thought, because I loved reading the book, I would enjoy this film since, I thought it would have been a comedy of some sort. The only thing that I was expecting would be a comedy like "Maverick" would be to see if the film would be able to be funny. I just thought, with this film, they might go into the film knowing that it was supposed to be a film about the true history of the man on the moon (which was actually supposed to come out in the film). They might go in and have some fun with it.  There's also a little bit of comedy in it (like the one I saw the night before) in the end credits for an obscure movie called "Moonwalker" where there is a guy who plays himself).  This was "Moonstruck" with "Moonwalkers" which is a little more amusing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know about the original film, this one is called "The Life" (and that was from the title of the film). The Life was a documentary about life in the mid-90's, and it's not one that's meant to be a very entertaining piece. The acting is atrocious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second attempt, so I don't know if it will get better or just get worse. I feel that it is because of the poor production. It looks like a really good production. I mean it has a great cast. The director has a nice story, like the first one, he has been involved with some other movies. There's one thing, when I saw it on VHS, the characters were all naked. The women had to have their breasts exposed. I know it's a fantasy, but it looks like they are just about naked. I don.  The director thinks that this is a fantasy movie. What they should do is make a fantasy film, with sexy people and beautiful women, like in the first movie. It would be great. I hope that they can somehow work this out, because this is just a silly fantasy with really poor production quality. The end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie does go into the details about the assassination and all. The movie is, for lack of a better term, an indictment of the movie that is:  "The Manchurian Candidate," the assassination itself.  I give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, because it is the kind of movie that you could watch and get a good laugh at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For one, I'm not the kind of guy who watches a lot of horror movies. The movies I watched were more of what I'd call a 'normal' horror flick.  The "good guys" are, I can see, on their way to find their "little girl" and find her, to fight the evil monsters and try to rescue their little girl. The little girl is on her way home from school, and is apparently just leaving for her own little adventure, or is, I assume, heading home to the house in which she was born and raised. She is just on her merry way.  "Good Guy" Monster

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not just talking about myself, and I'm sure I'm in the minority in this. This is a truly awful movie. The acting is horrible.   Do yourself a favor and see it with the kids when you have a family of four or five or six or whatever you want, or if you can get a copy of it's probably better.  It's been reviewed by some people that this is a PG-13 movie, which is absolutely ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really low budget. There was actually one scene that was done by cinematographer, and he did a fantastic job, because he did great work on the street in his previous film, "Night Market". In this one, it really wasn't that great, really, and it doesn't really get that much credit for its acting. There are scenes that are so beautiful and moving in this film, and you just can't have them in this little indie film.  I can't really understand why the filmmakers decided to film this film with a completely different cast than the film that just came out. And as a writer, it's kind of like the "festival of love" film, which is just the way the director wanted the film to be.  In any case, this film is a really small budget and it's really hard to watch this film. I was so glad to see the good reviews that this film was doing and I didn't think that I was going to be alone. The film is probably best described as "indie film" (although I really think it should have been called "dramatic indie film") in the festival, because it's a sort of artistic "film" at the festival. The soundtrack is by the way really good and very interesting.   It has some very talented actors. I saw it again last night when I went to the festival of "Night Markets", and this is more similar to the sort of films that I would have liked to see.  It is interesting to read a bit about the "film noir" films and how they get compared to the classic noirs. It's also worth looking at some of the writing by Peter Weir and what he wrote about noir films, because the way they are presented in this documentary doesn't fit what it was supposed to be like. It really makes it difficult to really see how any of it fits together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, there was a very good review here about some good movie called "Citizen Kane" which was really the last film of "John Thaw". "Citizens" is not really any great film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll give you my history of how the movie business works. I'm not gonna put up with the bad guy. He plays like a kid, has no talent at all, he's played in so many movies that he must be one of the oldest actors in Hollywood, or maybe the youngest, I don't want to watch that movie again, it sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the movie at The National Film Theater of Great Britain. (I think it was the 4th night of production) and that's just because I'm British.)  I know this movie was directed for the English speaking audience as well as the American one (which was not the case), and that it was a movie with English subtitles (which they had already in some cases, but I have to say that I didn't understand a word of what they said. I can't think of anything they're saying. I could tell that the movie makers weren't really thinking through the situation they were in. If you want to sit and watch a movie that you think you can really absorb or something you can watch this movie with your kids to show them how movies can affect you and to get a good lesson on the power of movies, I'd recommend something they've done in the last three days or so, like the new movie "WONDER WOMAN." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard a lot of good things about this movie. The story would have been interesting, it is a very heavy film, it isn't all that great. The acting is pretty good (I liked the direction of this), and the direction had been pretty good, and it was done fairly recently.  I saw this as a kind of homage, which is quite obvious, and I'm thinking it is not done very often that a tribute movie (especially with a lot more obscure material) does it with a pretty good budget and I don't want to think about how it would have looked like. I just thought it might be interesting to see some of the old movies in this regard, to see the progression of the time and what kind of movies it might have been about, something along the lines of "Empire of the Sun" or "The Ten Commandments of the Ancients", maybe in a very light film about something like the lost city of Atlantis, and seeing how they were more lighthearted and less serious than we were at the time we're having this discussion now.  In the end, it just goes to show the old age of this movie, and the very limited and low budget that it was made with. It is an absolutely mind-blowing mistake to have put this on the shelves, and not even a little bit cheesy at all! It will make you want to take my advice and rent it again, if you like this movie you will hate it, and at least for now, buy it again when they're out of it, or get the next rental. It's that bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a terrible attempt to make a movie about love or redemption. Even a guy like the director gets to be a lead character.  It's the end of the world if you think you're gonna change it's true, it's not. The movie is really awful and doesn't give a second of my life.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was directed in England. In the UK the movie would have to be re-edited to make it more acceptable for general release in the UK. We know it was shot on a cheap budget (especially considering the film is supposed to be 'for the little man') so there is a small chance that the movie might be available on the video store shelf in the US. The DVD release is being shown on video in Britain and will probably come out on video there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what happens when the producers, in order to make a quick buck, try to capitalize on the popularity of the film by producing a film that was intended to be a comedy. It is a shame that the people of this world, who are supposedly inspired by the great works of the human race, had to endure the terrible results of the result of this film. I would strongly recommend you not to rent this film and wait for the film "The Great Comet", which is an excellent comedy from director of the great "Spring Breakers".

The beginning is what caused this movie to start off with.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've ever seen a movie before, you'll know that movies are supposed to be funny and entertaining, especially to see and hear it on the big screen.  There are many reasons why this movie is the most depressing and depressing thing to see in the world. I thought I knew how sad this movie was going to be because I'm in my early 30's, I watched it for a whole afternoon and it just continues to be that way. I hope they get some help because it is just depressing and saddening.  I don't want to think about a movie where the actors had to watch the end of it for fear of it, and then go, "Well, oh, that would be awful," and then get all excited about it to make it a real movie, because that would actually be funny, which is what happens when you see the movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a pretty good movie, with the actor who played the role of a "retired" police officer named "Bob" (as the movie had him do in the last film).   The plot is about a retired police officer, "The Cop" (who is actually named "The Driver") who is attempting to break up this group of thugs, and he attempts to do so by trying to pull over a taxi cab driver, who is actually an "ex-cop" who worked for the LAPD. It seems that the production companies don't really get it, or don't understand what the police officers, who actually make up the "cop" do, and I can't imagine the result would be the best. The police officers didn't do anything wrong (except for trying to have the cop get in trouble over something he didn't commit), they were just trying to help, if anything, the director, and the rest of the cast, who were trying to do some detective work (see "The Good Cop"). It was a "good cop movie" because the director intended for the cop to do an in-depth investigation into what happened in the taxi cab; I mean, the "bad cop" (I really believe) movie, the cop is a complete unknown to the audience, and if you are trying to see this movie and don't have all the information that I am sharing here, it would be impossible to do a very good job. In the meantime, I am hoping that the film's success will be what this one was before: in the realm of the "good movie" that would explain to us, the characters, the action, the direction and finally, finally make us believe in this cop andbut unfortunately, that's all this movie was to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was such a great idea to let my friends all take their own time and enjoy the movie together. The kids were such great but the movie is too predictable and so not as entertaining as the movie that was made about three years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning I had a lot of fun reading a good book. I have seen so many of them and enjoyed them. It didn't take long to get through it and after reading it I'm afraid that, as a person, I have been influenced more by the film than the book. The book is about the characters and their personalities and their relationship with one another.   A little too much of the book was about what would happen to the characters after their deaths, and the film was more about "how to find out" why they were dead and what happened to them and what the ending would be. So I guess the book would have been more accurate and perhaps less confusing. If there is any justice in this world I hope that people will stop spoiling these books by viewing this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It all began at about 11:30 pm.   This has to do with the time when the actors first arrived at my house. I'm the one who hired them (I've got to know them all a bit). When I met the other party, who was at least one of the stars of the movie, he was already there and, therefore, he had the nerve to arrive on my doorstep before me, with a gun!  What was the point? He was, at the time of his arrival, about a quarter of an hour from my house (I had no idea what the other actor was like, so I'm glad I didn't know what I had in mind and went to the other end of the street). (At least I didn of course think about a few hundred million dollars!)  We were about to embark on a life-long adventure of life-like reality with no expectation of getting paid for it (in fact, for the foreseeable future, so don't you dare judge me!). The only "happily ever" ending was to have been the day the two of us met and fell in love (or so it seemed, but it was all short-lived and I'm not going to give it further time...) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a movie, so I shouldn't be expected to give my opinion on other movies I've seen. The movie is actually about a new film that was on the DVD, which is called "Lights" and has a much lower budget.  It is a completely different story than what was on DVD, even the DVD of "Litre de la Terre," which was a documentary film about this very real and sad story of women in the French countryside.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One year ago, a "comedy" from the same company, that movie had won the Golden Globe for best comedy ever at the London Film Festival. (I remember it.)  (It was actually a movie called "The Comedy Of Paul.")  One of the guys who won the Best Foreign Film award in the London Festival was the same guy who won Best Comedy at the Vancouver International Film Festival, where this movie was actually being sold for $19.99. The only reason this movie has made it on to DVD is because it is a comedy, although some people are trying to tell me that this is a serious film about the war, but I find it to be very low budget. It's made almost entirely of photographs, and the sets are completely made of cardboard, or plastic, which I find extremely unsuitable for serious entertainment. It is not an extremely interesting film either, as I felt that I could really tell it's story through the eyes of the other guys, and that it was the end of the first movie that really left me with a sense of what was going to happen, and what was really happening in the eyes.  I really felt that they were not trying to show what had been happening for the past couple of years (which is what I called in my review "the "old war" movie") in this, with the war being in the second half of the movie, and how I was expecting to get a little bit more of a "sense" of the story and the emotional connection between the guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has been made since 1994 and had no problems making it on the local video store in the town of St. Joseph, IL. There are a few actors in the movie who were also in the late 70s and early 80s and were in "The Naked Gun" movie. This movie has a fairly good idea to be a comedy, as it has a bunch of people getting drunk. Some of the characters are well thought out; there is a nice scene of a girl taking a shower and her friend making out in the shower with a man and some young people who are just beginning to discover sexuality and get sexually involved. I think. butbutbutBUTbutbutbecause of the sex scenes in this movie, and what is happening in the bathroom between the two leads (and the one at the beginning of the movie with the guy who is making love to the girl in the "The Nudity" movie) the lead of the bathroom scene is nude (and not very covered). If he's going to go topless, he'll be naked in the next movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It wasn't until I had gone and seen a couple of other films that I knew what a 'film' was. I guess it is the one that most people know, and they know it in the film, but I guess when I watched it, I saw it as a 'documentary' because, of course, I want it to look good, and I think the title gave it that impression.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film does not have a beginning, middle or end to it. The director has chosen to leave the characters and the film's history in the past. So what do we have? The characters of the movie are as they were in the book, but the characters of this film are as in the novel only with the exception of the wife and daughter who are currently in England and not in Ireland. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll say, there are still some really good movies being made, and they have to be made in a foreign country, or at least a different time, and in this case, the original, released in 1992, would of been the main subject of a film, the subject of this film would of meant to be a study of the Holocaust. If you want to find out more about the Holocaust, you have to look at books or learn about it. To me, this film was, unfortunately, not about the truth, about truth, truth and truth, and it was based on facts that people could not verify, about facts that it should have been, about the fact that it was very biased and untrue. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion on this film was that this is a low-budget flick.  It didn't have the most exciting credits sequence of the "The Godfather" or "God of War" (two of the most memorable ones in my opinion) or the most outrageous premise. In fact, the only thing that comes close to a low budget is "Godfather III" with its "De Niro" cameo. I don't think it should be the biggest film of the year or something akin to an action thriller. It should be something more in the vein of "The Life of Julia," which is the way the director and the producer seem to be aiming it, which is more like "The Wayward Son" or a coming of age movie. It will have a lot more success if they try to get that type of audience involved. I'm just glad they didn't make this low budget movie. There is nothing more frustrating and boring than watching a horror film on cable or HBO or an art movie (the worst of which being the "Ghosts" trilogy, which I watched years ago and was really bad). I'm also glad that I didn't pay to see this at the Toronto International Film Festival, which, I imagine, would have been at least as bad. And now, if you know me, you'll know that I don:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only other movie this year that was this bad is this.  I just watched it because I was a fan of "Pollyanna" (I've never seen this one) and I was really curious as to what was in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie in a strange movie theatre in Ottawa, and it has been out for the week. It is so dark, and so bleak, that it is depressing to watch. It's so stupid. It was a terrible, bad comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this before, so I can't say how many people have seen it before. I don't know that I can do any better, or have more of a negative impact than to tell you how bad this movie was, and I was sick the entire time I watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite movie is 'The Cat In The Hat,' starring Jim Carrey and Owen Wilson. They are a wonderful team. I love the film but I am still very unhappy with how this film turned out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sorry, I couldn't finish it because I could not even get past the first few minutes of it. It's not a bad film, in fact it's quite decent. I think the problem is the fact that I'm an American who's seen all the movies and films from the 1970s and 80s, so I was looking at the British DVD, which has only one or two films from that era. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame that the "making of" movie didn't have a sequel in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To start off, I was at the beginning thinking that this was going to be a pretty good comedy. I mean, if you watched the first part of this review and saw me do stand-up, you know my background of being funny. I'm not as well versed in comedy but even if I was, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. And, it doesn't make the funniest film either. In fact, I couldn't even watch this film until I left. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of my best friends and my best director, Michael Moore (A lot like "Citizen Kane") just did a film in New York a year ago with another friend of mine, "American Hustle" and just went to this movie. And just in general, I think that there is a big difference between a big movie (like "American") and this film. The "American" film, like this one, was about the American story of people who are "American"; that's why the story is so interesting, because that is what is happening here but this film was pretty mediocre, I just think that it got a pretty good reception at the box office.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this to be rather a documentary in its current form with some of the best documentary makers in the business and this is why I did not like the movie for lack of documentary makers (if there was a documentary there would have been a movie here that showed the incredible effort put into the work of the documentary makers and in it's current form (a few scenes here and there) which would have added to the work here to make the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of Tom Hanks' movies, and he's the director of the best ones. He should be very familiar with the director, I think, having worked on many of them together. That said, this movie had a little bit of everything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on cable. It was the first one to me, and I went through the whole movie. It's been released in the United States. I bought it on video for $1.85. The DVD edition is about $4.50. As the guy in the video says, I was actually the cheapest person in the theater.  A movie is meant to be watchable by a few hundred bucks or less, and this movie is the biggest hit of all the movies that I've seen,butbut that doesn't mean I can afford to pay the amount of money that these guys were asking me to buy this movie. There are a lot of things that are not in the movie and people are going to get the impression that the movie is in bad taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's too bad to have me waste my time on it, or to watch an hour and a half, I think, and then I try to think about my "good" feelings for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off I'm not a huge film-critic. I think it's about the same as, say, "Worst Movie Of All" and so I can't speak too much about it was just a film I'd seen from the press and I know it was supposed to be a big budget film or something.  If you look at the film credits on IMDb, it says "The First Film" and "The Last Film" or something like that. It's only after the DVD release that you'll realize how far this really was. If you're reading this film, I don't recommend going out of your way to see this film. It was awful and terrible. It didn't make sense. It made me laugh. It makes me laugh at some ridiculous things. You had to be, like, a real idiot to watch this film with me in it.   It was bad, and the guy who directed this was supposed (and should have) to be really, really good, like in this film he directed this film in "The Final Cut" that's really a low-budget film which made a real joke of it. It just doesn't look like it was ever meant to be released to the public, it really didn't do this film justice. If this film had been a really, REALLY, great comedy, I'd give it a 7.  I recommend this to people who want to see something a bit cheesy that is a comedy of some sort, like a low budget horror film. If it's a comedy about horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original version had a great cast. They were excellent actors.  The same actors were in the original movie and this was their third time doing the movie.  What's up with the original version's actors? It has an eerie atmosphere, as you can see in the first three episodes of this series. I feel that I was in a small town, just living in the town, and I felt haunted by the townsfolk in the series. Therebut the new actors are supposed to be from somewhere else and are simply bad.  There's a lot of people on this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a whole, I liked "The Matrix" (a very different movie!) because it has an underlying message and message of rebellion and rebellion is in the movie "I've seen what they do to innocent people, so let's say, it doesn't look as good" at all...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really curious to see if this is a movie about a couple of "hot" women with their breasts being squeezed.  I'm not kidding, I really didn't know what to expect.  This is not a comedy. There's absolutely no way it's funny and it would just be ridiculous. It was even more tedious than the first one. There were more laughs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with a man named "George" telling us about his wife's illness. This is the second time in a month that George is sick or near death...he's so sick that he can't stand up.  There is no reason for a person to make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first film with the whole "God of War" thing, and it was made in Japan, with a completely Japanese cast.  I have to say that my Japanese friend did her best, trying to understand the meaning of these movies, but I don't know if she's a big enough person to understand, or if she was at all. I find it extremely boring, and pointless, it doesn't take any special skills to survive, and the only reason I can possibly describe it as "interesting".   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can honestly say that I've gone through a "normal" movie on video, and I'm pretty sure I've watched a million crappy movies in my life, that this was not an easy film to watch. It was difficult to watch the film for anything other than one sitting down and it had a bad effect on the film itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only thing I'm allowed to watch in two hours and 20 minutes on Saturday. I really don't understand how such a horrible movie is allowed to be shown on the tube. It's like the whole movie is made to get people to laugh.   I'm not a kid anymore and this should be just the first 30 seconds and then I'll be back home on my own time on Saturday evening. I didn't really care about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that I've seen with the name of 'Fargo' has come to my local video store, which is one of the many video stores in the Twin Cities. That Fargo is a movie about the Minnesota State Fair. It's not like a 'film festival', where the whole audience gets to see the film.  The movie starts at the fair, on the roof of the Minnesota state fair building, and there is a trailer for it, so they have not actually gotten into the movie yet.  This movie is a festival, and a very short one at that. It was like one of those really bad, 'freeze' kind of movies, with a good plot, but only very few people knew what happened to the characters and why they were doing the things they were trying to do. I can't believe that this movie was released without any sort of promotional push. It probably isn't worth the film-store price or something like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For the entire length of the movie I was trying to watch this in the least "offensive" way I could.  What's next? There was no way I was going to sit in the theater and experience this piece of garbage. If you're in the mood to experience something at all, buy the sequel to "Curse of the Demon". I'm not even going to talk about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen it yet, I don't know how bad this movie was before it was made.  This is about 90 minutes of pure blackness, the blackest movie ever made. In terms of quality, it looks like a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only real connection that exists between me and the guy who directed this film is that when I was younger he was the one in the car with me. And that's about it, and even that was enough for me to laugh at his stupidity in the film. He is an idiot. It doesn't get any worse than this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is really interesting, and the music was really good when I first heard it.  But I guess this was just another one. My opinion of the movie, I think it is a waste of time, the director made a mistake in his own personal life and has nothing to do with his role as an actor. He seems to be so into the whole family reunion thing and to be like that is just ridiculous. I have to admit that he did the best thing and make fun of how ridiculous the whole thing would be. He did a great job with the role of the old man who was trying to be a hero and was trying very hard to be the great father to his daughters, and even though the mother is trying to do the same thing, he was the only character that actually tried to be funny and made it funny and that was in the "My Cousin Vinny" sketch, and he tried to do a pretty good impression of my cousin who was actually pretty funny and goofy.  I mean, we all know that people are very hardy people. There's no way he could act like he was acting when he was at his worst condition. He does a really good impression as the old gentleman who was the uncle of my auntie who was supposed to be an old woman, but that was really funny. I think he is a bit over the top with his acting here, especially as a dumb and gullible young man.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a number of Hollywood movie stars who are either dead or living famous lives and are in their prime. For example, Bette Davis is the most famous and famous actress of all time. BetteDavis is still alive, and I just saw her a few years ago in the movie "One True Thing" and is wonderful. So I was hoping for something from here to be a great movie like "One true Thing".  There is a reason for the movie being called "Mental illness" (it was made as such), I don't know why it is called the "Mentally Ill movie".  In this film, people see mental illness as if it were a horrible disease, and they really do not know what they are dealing with.  Some of the characters in the film were so badly written that they didn't have the guts to take on any of the people they dealt with, and that is simply not possible in a film.  It really makes the viewer think that the man is not as tough as he really is.  I give this movie three stars because I feel it was only three, I gave this film three.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, which was called "The Big Easy," is about 2,000 square miles -- about half of an island. It's also based on the actual location, which is about 90 miles away. Even the characters were based on it. So, how did it turn into something about two guys who went and killed the bad guy? In the film, they are trying to show off. They are trying do this because they were portrayed as great heroes, and because they have all these great stories of men who are supposed to be dead. The bad guy, who was supposed to take these good guys and turn them into killers, turned them into men who couldn't remember what had happened.  The "good guys" were shot from the hip. The good guys were in the right place at the right time. The "bad guys" didn't get the right gun, so that they couldn't shoot the bad guys off the island. This guy didn't know the island very well, so he came on it and didn't like it very much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is supposed to be a comedy, I don't think it's an accident that it's called "The Comedy". The two leads are really terrible, and their jokes are so bad, I feel that it could be played for free, just to play them, which is sad.  You'll find yourself rooting for the lead to be the worst guy you possibly could, and you'll be laughing all the while at this, I won't recommend this movie, I find it really unbelievable that they thought it was going to be so good, I hope they just lost money and I think they won't see the light of day for their movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a number of good actors and I believe they have gone through the process of trying to find themselves in this movie. I'm not sure why the director wanted to put me in this particular spot. The director is also being accused of trying too hard to be sympathetic or sympathetic with the lead, I just happen to know about this movie through various friends. If you want to know what the director's reaction was to the reviews or comments of those who knew about the movie, you'll find out. There's a pretty good chance he'll come up with a good film out of this mess. I mean it's a terrible mess, but there's so little I didn't feel anything close to good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did enjoy the ending of this film, it was a sort of a 'true ending', i.e. the end credits to 2001, with the blue-sky and a blue sky, and the final words of 'Life On Earth'.  I think this film was like 'Hollywood 101', just trying to get the actors to do the scenes as they're used in 'Gremlins', just plain plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to be honest, because I feel like this film is just another movie, with another story. It's just me and my two friends. If you're reading the other reviews, this might be your movie. If it's not, don't pay for it. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, after all, I had read the book and liked it, I felt like I was going to be the third woman in the world, if this movie is anything like the book, then I would give it a 10. So, do your research before you make that kind of decision. This movie was really really really stupid. It makes the movie that it was about seem awesome, because, well, the characters in the book were dumb, and not all that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I did like the idea of a "Dawn of Man" film, when the idea is that the ancient Egyptians were so advanced, technologically, that they had the knowledge to build an actual tomb (like a pyramid). Some of the films make more sense to me than others when it comes to what I was looking for (e.g. one where the pyramids are being built).  Then there are some very good documentaries that have been released recently:  I have just been watching The Ten Commandments, which is a very good documentary that I'd recommend.    For example, with The Ten, I'm assuming most people had seen that documentary.  As a result, I was interested to see this documentary, and I think that was the main reason I watched it.  Now, it has been stated in some of the reviews that this is a documentary about the "life" of the director's family.  I had just been reading about this film, and had noticed that it was a true story of one man, and that's what I believed it to be.  It is still a true true story, but it was much better told in the 10 Commandments.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is going to be released by Disney.  It's not a bad film, because the people who made this are professionals, so this movie isn't going to have the kind of budget that other films have had. The film starts in China. It doesn't have the luxury of going back into a lot of the places that we visit in the film, where the characters are from and interact with them. There are also a lot more people in this film (and some really good looking people)butbut they haven't traveled a lot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to give you any of my personal opinions about this movie, and so I'm going to try to give some people some real information about this bad movie. This movie is about the love between two peoplebut, it's not a happy movie. The actors are very bad. They are bad actors who are trying to be funny with an earnest attitude and, as I've said before, are trying, to be sweet and are very sweet (it's not "sweet") and just act like they want their roles. They're trying to do it like they're still teenagers and they're trying their best to not be terrible.  I can honestly say, the movie is not a comedy or a romance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What is more disturbing is what is presented in this film. And what is so sad is that so many people have gone to see it. This film is not scary, and I found it as disturbing as when I read the novel (not the movie) as a 14-year old girl.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was supposed to be a comedy that will be funnier than this, but the way the film was put together it was very obvious that the director was trying to make it a comedy with all the actors on stage, and a comedy would have probably been better. Some of the movie's comedy lines were pretty funny, and the way that they came out were pretty good, and some of the actors in the film were pretty talented, and I would be disappointed to see them go through this again.

I don't know how much they would miss something that is this famous. I'm pretty sure it would be the talk of the town in London, if anything. If they do it right, and make the film as entertaining as possible, but it is pretty obvious what they did, and what they should have done.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the directors is a friend of mine. I went to see him at a very public film festival when he was first "famous", and one reviewer in this film said, "You could see the actor (in this film) from the beginning, and you could see them at a college theater."   I have no idea what sort of "filming style" he uses. The camera is "small" and "small-budget" like so many other "independent films."  You can read my review on this film for some more information, about the other director who does a "real" movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so terrible that I was completely disgusted with the movie. There was so much sex in this movie and not so much to make sense of it. There were too many of these stupid characters to be real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that the actor's are at least talented, and they were good enough to have made movies about the old Hollywood stars, or even actors. There are at this point very few actors who have any knowledge whatsoever of acting or screenwriting, and there are at minimum two. I've seen them in other movies, and the reason they have to be so good in their old movies was because it was one of the first movies, so their knowledge of those topics was already pretty solid. The only one who comes close to the level of knowledge of this one is Bill Paxton, who has appeared in the original "Glorious" TV series and "Gangster". If I knew this was the only one of its kind, I would have felt more sorry for this guy. The director has to say he tried to keep the budget low, and in that regard, it's a relief to have him watch his lines and not rely on the script, and that's saying a lot. If I were to say more on his lack of knowledge, it would be a really long movie, and if you were to watch it, you'd say "What the heck is this?" In any event, what did I see in this film was a pretty good, low budget movie from the 1950's that was made for a family audience. You know, kids and families. The idea is that it's based on a true story and about a family. As such, it might have been able to get away with a much different story, and you wouldn't necessarily have to have been a child. It doesn't seem that any other movie has done it with this one, and so I guess there's no point in comparing it to anything else for comparison purposes. The film is like a film that was released a couple of years ago about the life of Robert E. Lee, with the addition of a bit of everything (from the original) and a lot more of everything that was going on in the lives of all the women involved, with a greatbutbutbutBUT. If you know anything about the way Hollywood does things, this film is supposed to be good, or at least not just good enough, to have merit in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really "Hollywoodized" - Hollywood. Hollywood, the most prestigious film studios in the world, is now associated with independent films. And, since this film was made in Canada, one would think that there would be a big cast. There are no good, decent or decent actors who have had their lives enriched by this film - this film is very bad at the end and is, overall, a "low-budget" film, a waste of 20 minutes of my life. I was hoping that it was going to be a very hard-to-make film, like "The Shining". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original "Logan" was an indy film, and it was very good.  The "Lollygag" was made in 1983. I think it is a crime for us to support the cause of the original "Giant Killers" in the "Lillygag".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out in a friendly way about a "B" film to which I just assumed that it would start out as a horror film that is very violent. I can't even believe that the movie was released in 1990, or maybe they had to get the distributor to let them do a print and sell a movie called "Halloween" or something like that, for that reason alone. They should be suing the filmmakers at the time, and that was not a pleasant movie for anyone. This movie was just awful, and it was at a time I was not even watching the movie, which was "B." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One night while I was sleeping, I dreamed about how it came to pass for me to be born in the hospital bed in the state of Florida, and I thought it was a real film. It was a weird 90 minutes that made me think that the best possible thing could happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's all the way from France to the States. My opinion about it is, that it is one of those movies made for international distribution, and not American distribution. It's made for the French movie buffs and movie buffs, and the movie has very few scenes shot in the USA and the USA is only mentioned briefly, when we see Bill Gates.  I was really mad about this one, because I want to see American movie makers. My point was that the movie was just released, so everyone could go back and rent it.  You can see some of the movie-making on the website. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie three times already. I've been the host of a lot of comedy shows and comedy festivals.

And it was quite enjoyable, although, the premise of a family of comedians, one "humorist" in a world of people, who are "homicides" and such, and the way the film was set was very strange and the film did end up showing a few segments of this. It wasn't supposed to be an expose of some sort, and there wasn't enough time to make any more of a complete film. The first film had an extremely brief and vague premise, so it had plenty of room to do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really upset with the people who have to do this job. I was really looking forward to a film that would make me laugh or something really silly and goofy or something. In the end, I went to this film expecting a comedy. I had a feeling that this would be a movie that would be hilarious and light-hearted and have some funny lines that would poke fun at the other characters. I didn't expect to be watching a comedy that was made for me.  I found it very, very hard to like the guy, even if he had been in this movie before. It made him look like he was trying to be very smart, which was annoying at best, the only really funny lines were in the end. I really couldn't figure out what was in his mind when he was talking to anyone, why he was going to make this guy the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the only real points in this movie is its attempt at historical accuracy (I love that, historical movies like "Life" or "Man in the Arena" or even the History Channel and "World War II" or any of the movies on DVD or VHS) It's pretty much the only point in the movie, I love movies that are based on true events, there's a point in this one as well about making a true statement about the history of the time (with the time-line etc.)  It's just the most accurate version of a verybutbutbutnotperfect history,butthat's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a sucker for anything that is remotely sexual, and the only thing I thought was going to happen was a lesbian movie.  The only thing that I could really hope was that the director could be as good at directing lesbians as he was with the male leads. I've always felt that the lesbian movies are treated unfairly, and as a result I felt somewhat insulted when I sat down to watch this. I'm hoping to be able to write something positive about this movie, and I can't see myself sitting through it. The best movie is so much better than this... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this film is the acting that was done in the short films and that's what I saw in the first three parts of this film. The third movie is about the time of life when the movie is made, and as far as I know, this is just a little movie to fill in that time period. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have much knowledge about the Japanese movies (I'm pretty sure they didn't have an English title to begin with) that is why I watched this film with subtitles, which is why it is titled this way. Although, it was never intended for such a statement... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had some knowledge about this film, or the director knew what he was doing, and I did know that it would be a sequel of this film. I did some research on the other films, like "A History of American Cinema", which I was unfamiliar with, because I was going to see it in the movie theater.  It was the other day, in an episode of "Tin Foil Hat", and I had to go back and watch it, and there was a brief mention of the film being about a man named Bill Sikes, who was Bill Sike. There was also an old woman sitting next to me, who claimed that she was in the original "A history of American cinema", which was on "The History Channel", so I just wanted to mention that she claimed that there was an old "History Channel" episode, when I am fairly certain that "History of American film" was on the same channel. I'd say that that's a definite sign that they were not even close to accurate when it came to this film! I found out that this was supposed to be a comedy, and that it was really a black comedy about an Italian American family. We have to think back in the mid-nineties when I saw "A Man Called Sully" and saw it for the first time, and how in that film, my family would go out and watch that film on "Wes Parker Presents", which would be very much a very funny film, because that was actually the same film that was making its way through theaters at the time. I think the film wasn't terribly good in the beginning, and it's a fairly dumb, stupid, slow paced comedy. You know, all of the usual stuff, you know how they had me think that it had a funny ending when it wasn't really funny, and this was no different.  I have to give it that I was about seven years old when this film came out, and my own family saw it, so I do know that my parents were not big people either!  The film would seem that it were made for kids. It's just a very, very dumb, badly made film that I've seen it all over again, I mean it's worse than the movie "The Goonies" from "The New Goonies", and that was made as a low budget, low budget film. It just blows, and all of these people, I'm just one guy, they
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the book and going into this movie, I was a sucker for the idea of a "book on a shelf". I thought that I would have been a fool.  I don't know if this is the same kind of movie that was made before, because I don in anyway care what kind of film it was before, but I'm just so confused. What a shame! I hope that there's some kind of DVD box that is going to have an ending to this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really intrigued to see a "Theater of the mind" since I've seen it as an original and that was one of the reasons I chose to rent this movie because of the movie theater in the future. I really wanted to know if this movie is a movie with the same director who did the original.  Well, it is, just one more one in the series. I had the pleasure of watching this movie with another reviewer who loved the first one, and she was really happy and content with her theater experience, and I really wish she'd been involved with this series since they might have been a great help in the production of this one. I was a young movie reviewer and had to see this one on the way home and I know that if I hadn't seen it the first time, I would have had some idea about what to expect of this movie. This was the same kind of thing. I'm very familiar with the series and I watched it last time in theaters and was amazed to see how a lot of the same dialogue from the first movie was repeated over and over again.  The dialogue is just as bad. The characters are really boring. I would recommend renting the first series to this one just for laughs and to get a better idea of what is going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had my doubts because I think it was a comedy and would be the "Discovery Channel's" show, "Finding Dory".  But after watching it's all a waste of money. Dory's trainer is an idiot, the shark eats like a baby, there's a lot of plastic in the ocean, and Dory swims the whole way to the beach.  It's better to pay the money for a full sized version of the DVD.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most important thing is that "D" in the title. This movie was released in 1981 and was shown on video in the U. It has an unfortunate association with the "D-Day" (June 6, 1944) where 4,500 American troops land in Normandy for the invasion of France. I was able to find a VHS of that day and it is in a good store and will most likely come back to me. This is not really "D"-day. I know, I am getting pretty philosophical. I have to say that it did take place in a military base. I also wanted to mention this that the movie's cover shows the Statue of Liberty and the Liberty Bell. I would like to suggest that if I had seen this film as a child when it came out I would have just been happy to see this cover, the Statue would have been more like a statue of some great military commander or something. This was a movie that was made in the late 1970s by Hollywood's own standards. This time period in Hollywood was very much more commercialized and did not offer the best taste to most Americans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the other reviewer pointed out, this is a black and white film that tries to shock the audience. The shock value of the film is low to me at the start of this film, and I was hoping to get into the shock factor of this movie.  The story is simple. You never really get a sense of what really happened with it, and it seems like the director wanted to make some sort of statement or comment on the event. And that's OK, he is trying to do this film with his name on it, which is one reason it's hard to understand what his point was about "what happens next".  The movie isn't just about shock factor. It's about people and their lives. Youbut I was thinking about "the other half of the coin", a movie like "The Blair Witch Project" or "A Ghost Story" where the killer is actually the main character.  I like the shock value I have gotten from these "The Omen" and "Aliens" movies, but they really go over time and try to make things so much more interesting, because that's how "The Silence" has to end. It doesn't leave you hanging on every edge of your seat, and even more so you aren't left guessing about what happens, and what you get stuck on is a basic and basic plot line. It leaves you wondering who dies and what's up with the killer.  Some things happen that you can really get into.  For example, the main killer, who was played by Kevin Spacey in the first three "Silent Hill" movies. It was interesting to watch him and try and figure out his motive to kill these people in an emotional and thought provoking way. He was a "Silence" killer and it's still a pretty important element of the story of what happened after he was found out to the townspeople of Silent Hill 3. The townspeOPLE were more of a threat to him after he killed their husbands, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, then their parents. As for the town folks of Silent Hills 3, they get buried alive and die after about 5 minutes. The other characters that have had their deaths are pretty bad. They are like "Silents"--there isn't enough of the town's life and the killer tries to be so dramatic that it gets ridiculous. The character and story of this "Silness" was good and I think could have been very good. There
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, the first three episodes (in Japanese) had some kind of weird conspiracy theory with the voice of Mr. Gackt...this one, or the third one anyway, is one of the most awful shows in recent memory. The first episode is a very basic little show with a couple of episodes and a little bit of music and this one is about a typical 60s movie plot about a normal woman being saved by some mad scientist and her life improving...and that's the way it is. It is really, really bad. Not only is it boring, the acting, the characters, and the plot really sucks. It does not redeem itself from "I'm Gackta Gack" (which, by the way, was pretty good and it wasn't supposed to have much to do with this). It is so awful and terrible that the show should be cancelled and ruined for all to see. If you had to see this show for a penny you would be better off getting a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be blunt about it, this film was the only reason I rented it, and I don't understand what the filmmaker thought. The "original" was a hilarious and good little film that could pull some clever jokes from the likes of David Hasselhoff and the likes. The reason why I'm writing this is because the film is so unbelievably amateur in every way possible, and the director's name is a disgrace to his work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film wasn't particularly good, in the end.  The film was filmed in Spain, not Hollywood. There is an attempt to re-trace a lot of the footage from the old Spanish version of the movie, in some Spanish language stores. I would like to talk to one of the directors of the original Spanish version, and give him the credit he deserves for making it to our screens in a film made for the Spanish people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was fortunate to see this in a 7-Eleven, and a 7" frame, so it could be shown in a reasonably small movie (I don't mean a "Hollywood-sized" film). Even I know that a 7'3" man has a bigger frame than 7"4" man. Also, I have a "Big Brother"-like frame, or some guy with a huge frame. If the character is to be believed, it has been made fun of and ridiculed numerous times by "Big Brothers" and other "hilarious" movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, there is that little chance. I think that's all there is in the world. If you are like me, you would be very sad, very sad to lose that person. That's my opinion. I know there are people that do love that person and don't know what's going on with that person or whatever, and if they're a fan of that person, and have to live through that, they'll know what it is like to lose them. They're in for a major disappointment. The movie really starts off by saying that the three kids, the oldest of the three, they're "coming to terms" and you know there will be some sadness. That scene is in a very cheesy way, and it really just shows that you really do need to come to terms with the loss of your loved one.  If you watch the whole movie, you're left asking, how can the movie be more like the television show? It really was just that bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not the way it looks (if you know the way how the movie is). It looks like it is based on an episode of a sitcom. I can honestly say that I have not seen any of the episodes of the series. It was the worst episode of the show. I give this movie a 4 out of 10. This movie was, as I stated, very badly written. It is so bad that I would not recommend it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would really like to recommend the film for the true horror genre.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was pretty awful... I mean it was pretty terrible, I can't believe how this came out on video in the United States! What a horrible film! I had to watch it again just to check what the other movie was like... This is not a movie I recommend anyone to spend any time of their life watching and only watch it if you have some real money on the line or something very important to you... this is one of the worst films I've ever seen and one of their special features of this was an Italian version of the film, not Italian at all, and it's not very good Italian film either either, so I'd encourage everyone to give it the kind of review it deserves and see the movie just the way it's meant to be...

It's not about making sense of what I saw in the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was lucky to get my hands on it. The movie is full of a lot of music, with some really great artists, but it also contains a lot, well, what it sounds like music, which makes the problem apparent: the movie was recorded with a lot more power. The power of the film is the sound stage, where the sound is supposed to be used. It doesn't have the right sound amplifier to use. The way the scene is set up, it is supposed that the sound in the movie is supposed look and sound like, "Dance of the Dragons", which was the most powerful sound on record at the time of the movie, so that the "Dragonfire" sounds in the film are supposed to come from the scene. The sound is, and it is loud, loud enough. In the scene that the Dragon is attacking a castle, for instance, the "dragonfire" is supposed for the sound of the explosion, so the dragon sounds much weaker. "Drakefire" and "DragonFire" sound much stronger, and the DragonFire sound in this scene is actually the Dragon's roar, as I understand the scene, and is quite similar. The other scenes of the castle are not nearly as noisy, so it is really difficult to hear what is going on, and you may not like it. This could be the result of a lack of the right room in which to play the scene at the start of the scene when the dragon is attacking the castle, or the lack of power in the sound. And if that were to happen, I'd suggest that one should not hear the roar of a dragon (which is the roar you'll hear at the beginning of the Dragonfire sequence) but hear the sound as it is meant to be heard (and as in the scene I understand it is intended to be played). This would make for a much better movie, and I believe that a lot would come from a lot less noise from a less powerful film, or maybe just from having the right place to shoot it. I know this is not the most expensive movie to make, but the sound was originally intended to go to theaters, and that was the sound that was used in the theater, and then the sound effects were made at Sound City in Toronto. In other words, a big thank you to the sound people at the sound house in Toronto for helping out with the scene (I think the scene still needs a "clean-up", or

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I found some time back when this movie was originally going to be released as a film. I am in for the ride. The "movie" is a black and white short. I won't get into the technicalities of that, other than to say the short version would run on a black-and-white radio, which is the "film" version. I will say the "movie trailer" had the "new" version of this short. Also, the audio is "talkies" rather than "theatrical," and you can hear all the lines spoken in the voice of the "star" rather then the "voice of the star," which I will assume meant the same thing as the "talkie" version, which makes me wonder how they made the transition. I also saw the short "The Great White Hype" and the audio for that is a different version.  The short is the only one of this kind of short with dialogue.  I have to assume I will see a trailer that is the same version. What is left of the movie is going to come out in a few weeks. The short's release will be before "The Wonderful Life," and that movie was, I believe, just released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third time they have made this film and it seems to have become a "go-to" movie for the same reason as the first one with the students at the University of Notre Dame or maybe they are looking for the student population at the other campuses and this is the fourth time they make it and I don't think the filmmakers are very clever when they make this movie. For example, when they say, "It takes courage to be an out gay man," they actually do not explain to the student that these students are gay and they should have said, "The film is based on the experiences of some homosexual students at an LGBT school." The students are going through a phase in their lives when they are making choices for which they are able to live happily (because it's supposed to be a love story), not a tragedy. I didn't want to see the film the last time around. I think the students were in the same situation they are now and they were told the stories of gay friends, lesbian friends, straight friends, etc, about what they had to do to get accepted by the faculty at our school. For one thing, they didn't know that there are students at this school who are in a stage of life where they were in a crisis because they're out. It was a shock to me to see how they made this movie (though I'm sure they were the first ones to film a "straight" love story for the film). It's so odd that a film like "The Student Body" would be the film to review (in a positive review).  It's even more strange that the director made this a film "straight," a film about what happens when straight guys make out with their male friends.   I don,t really care about the film being released in the other countries because it's a very short film and not very good, but it's going to be released in a video format on a DVD for all the world.  This film is so sad and it really pains me to watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an independent film, released by a small independent company called Black Mask. There were some great independent filmmakers that should've gotten their hands on this film for free. I'm a huge fan of this filmmaker. It should've been released last year.  This movie is not good. I can recommend to all of the viewers that I watch this movie with my friends who had already seen it and enjoyed it. This is the movie that made "Black Mask" a cult favorite of mine. This film was in black and white. This one is in black, white, and red. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a "documentary". Yes, it tells the truth about the war (about the bad war) on the silver screen. Yes, that's the way I see it. And it's the truth.but the truth is that it is very low budget and very small, with an "X" rating.  I mean it was a small independent production, with a budget of a few hundred bucks.  It is just ridiculous, the movie is boring, the acting is bad, the production is bad and this "documentation" is a real disaster.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really surprised to read that the other commenter had said that this was actually a movie. That was the only movie of it (this was only released for VHS). I thought I would actually see some really great films made for VCD or VCD2 format. Maybe that could happen (VCD or DVD).  I also read that this movie was not really a comedy. Maybe this is what happens when you're a comedy writer (as I was once) that makes you work in it for an hour and hour on your funny characters. It's not an action comedy (yet) and I just wanted to see something good.  The other reviewer had really good things to say about this movie, that they might have seen a few minutes of. It was a comedy about a funny movie about a movie about an action movie. Maybe they were not thinking about a straight action comedy, and they wanted to watch it in the movie theater.    That's why it might be an action film that is supposed to be the sequel to this. In any case, I didn't like the character. She was very wooden and I think that she was not at all the funny character that I'd have liked to have.  I think the director of this movie made her look like a perfect person, and there were some really funny moments with her being a blonde or something like that, and I would love to see some real characters of real people, not plastic people. It reminded me of that movie where The Producers is played by a plastic woman, not exactly the Producers' kind of person, who was really really stupid in a funny manner. It looked like the kind of guy you'd find in a comedy show, and not The Proprietress of a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the more obscure films. I'm sure that the director's had some sort of meeting or conference with some of the big Hollywood stars. There was something like an interview with Jack Lemmon, who's character was a major role in the "Rain Man" series, and I presume the director had something to say about how to direct Lemmon.  For my tastes, the movie starts out on a very serious tone with the first of the three "film classes" we saw on this channel.    It really doesn't make much sense to watch it on the small screen and certainly not as an "interview".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be a comedy. My husband and I found it to be "comedically" awful, awful, terrible, and horrible. I found the way the movie was filmed to be so poor. And not just in how it's acted, but how it was filmed was terrible in every way. And the guy was so incredibly annoying, annoying and stupid. It made me think "why I'd ever give this guy any money." It was awful. I don't even know how he got into acting in this movie. I had no interest in the film at all. I gave it two stars for a "family" viewing experience with a couple friends. It was like watching a child trying to act, even at one point in the "interview scene" when they did the scene with him and his friend. The way he acted was so bad that the only thing that made this film worthwhile was the ending, which is not a great movie anyway. I highly recommend going to see this movie for the comedy aspect of it, or in some of the other reviews that are written about it by other people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a mixture of genres, and is mostly shot in North America, or Canada, although the film has been produced in several countries, and there are some English films in which it appears, and the English version will appear in this film. I'm pretty sure that the majority of people reading this review are English-speaking and that they won't really understand what's going on. It is interesting to see how other reviewers are talking about a "Canadian" film, because they really mean Canadian film. A good example is what I heard at the "Canadian film festival" where they were discussing the film of my brother, "Sleeper". It is probably not a good thing to see the film at all, in fact.

The film was a film about a family. This movie was made for a little theater in a small Alabama town called Haughton, which is right on the edge of town. The town was tiny compared to other small towns. I can only imagine how this movie was sold to the public in town. There's nothing about the movie to even be considered a family film. This was intended for children to view. It was made in a theater, I mean REALLY out of town in Haugh ton. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting some sort of great movie. I thought that I'd go see the movie and see a story of this movie, with the genius "Dancing Astronaut" that would make it all worthwhile, that's right, it was a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My heart breaks for the person who wrote that review. I don't know who else can relate to this movie. My only hope is that a director like James Stewart can do something with this. Perhaps it can be seen as a tribute. It is about a man who gets his butbutbutbutandbutbut.... It seems like they tried to make a comedy with this movie...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really felt sorry for this guy when he went to pick up the dog from the pound.  The other thing about this film that really bothered me was the fact that the dog looks like it was taken from an animal shelter. I mean, I am not really in the business of being a dog rescuer. My dog looks better than this guy's dog looks. I am looking at a German Shepherd. He is 5'7" tall and about a 40 pound German Shepherd at the very least. I will not buy the whole story in the movie. Maybe he was a good actor and was hiding behind his good looks. So I did not think that he was completely honest in this movie.  I'm pretty sure that I didn't just watch it on TBS and ABC (the other network I saw the movie on) and that I watched it on the History Channel, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen it on the big screen and the one and only time it has been shown on television, and I really didn't care much about it, and it wasn't shown for an hour straight either. I have no idea why that is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was about a couple of families from California. We were invited to stay with some families from New York. This is a little over 3 years after they have moved. They had been living in their current house for 15 years.  We rented a small town cottage on a quiet day. There was no notice from the director or the producers to rent this little place, which they have not rented to many people. I was just told that the new house was ready to go. This was not made known to the house owners until my wife and I showed up to a vacant house. They were very confused. We also ended up renting the wrong house for the day. Our first stop was the house and I would have probably rented the second one. So, while my wife was in the process of putting our names down to rent, we ended up getting a new home for the night. The owners had already changed the locks, and the next day found our new place. It is also very tiny. They are currently renting the house I stayed in.  The only bedroom that looks even slightly comparable in size is the kitchen/dining room, which has a closet. It's actually a fairly large place with 4 people sleeping there. The only bed is the bed we got used to while the other 3 slept in the living room. Also, they have a small dining room with two beds, a couch, and a tiny bathroom. I had to turn on the TV in the dining room to watch some music and listen to the phone call while the wife and children were in the room.  They have a big, beautiful, modern house on the side, with a big foyer. It really is gorgeous, and they should be living there. They must have used it quite often in the 70's.  I am very happy to live there. We just rented it for the weekend. We want to be able to have a good, long conversation with the neighbors, and not have to stay on the phone all the time with them. They will not understand this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a very low budget production and really bad special effects. There is a bit of a resemblance with the "Trouble" series and its been done before. I remember watching "Truly Strange Tales" and watching that series. I don't think anyone should see this series on DVD. It has the most annoying name and the most over rated character in the whole series. It is not worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie had to happen within a few days (with the exception of one great night at the lake). In the end, we had to watch the movie, and I guess some of my fellow cast members had better luck than I did. My opinion is that the film is more "adult", and has adult-type material. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A group of friends (who, incidentally, were probably just getting together for a night of fun) were having fun in a small park and were, as we all are, having a really good time together. They were not, nor were they ever treated as "innocent." They were, in fact, subjected to a total of 11 years of imprisonment on charges related to the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, and they were subjected to several days of police investigation during which time their lives were essentially "made up" in the court's eyes. I can't think of a person in a normal, normal life who would feel comfortable watching this film. I will say that I'm very biased in the direction I found it in, and I'm a big believer in the message of Jonestown, and in the book that was written about the movie. I did go to the library for this film, and watched it on video, and my opinions might have differed. This is not a movie about one of these people having their lives made up. This film makes light of the true horrors of Jonet Ramsey's murder, and is basically, just a film about the lives of the people involved. I guess that makes sense considering who's in the movie, but I can tell you, that's it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it hard to read the plot for this movie (yes, i was looking for the book as well). I really felt cheated. I don't really know why i got the DVD on, or why i was asked to watch this in the first place, or what i was expecting from this movie. I honestly felt guilty that i wasted money, time and energy on this movie, and to be honest i am now going through the motions of watching it.  I honestly don't recommend this movie unless you are in serious need of a film to watch (i wish i could be one of the few who got to see it in the theatre). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the story of a guy and his wife in their home in Ohio. The guy is the one and only character in the movie and he is completely unrelated to this "heroic" tale of two guys from Hollywood.  The whole movie is about a guy from Ohio's home and, as such, it really just a film that takes place on a weekend in Ohio's town and the guy from the movie from the real world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To say this movie is worth watching is, like many films, in an era of black people that are being victimized.  To watch this movie and make a judgement about it's worth and the life of a black person is like one that only has a single grain of water. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a comedy that was made for the television channel in the U. The TV series is a collection of 20 one- and two-minute clips.  I am sorry that people like myself didn't have time to write about this.  The movie is very confusing in the "plot" and in the ending. I think that it was only made clear at the end of the "movie theater" version and even that was only a few days after the movie was released. There are "bad guys" that will be on the TV series, who are just as bad as the bad guys in the movie. I am so glad I rented the movie and gave it some time to "wander" in the theater, then I would have found out about this movie's plot before renting the "TV movie" version. I would like to think that I would be in a place where I knew what my choices were.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors play "The General" who was a Confederate general during the war and so are we. When I watched the first episode I really liked the actors playing "The War" and they were in a good position to be involved in a war film. I just think that the war in the film was just another excuse for these characters to exist and so they had the time to prepare themselves to be "Geniuses" rather than mere "Genius" actors.  The movie was so bad that I laughed.  It is truly unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it very easy to do and didn't have any sort of inner fire to work with, with very little inner drive to learn, to do what I had learned to do, in a very short period of time, by which I was allowed to watch this movie with no warning or knowledge of what I was actually doing. It was very confusing and not at all entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a film student at the University of Kansas, I had the great privilege of seeing this on film, it's probably a pretty good one in general. The film was released in 1990, so I'm sure the student population at the university is older than some of my other colleagues. They should know better than to judge it.  As is usual, a person's life was not put on film. This is a horror film, meant to scare you, not just show you some pretty girls, and yes, there are some pretty women. The main character is an intelligent person, and he gets a job at a computer lab at the end of the film, and his girlfriend (the film is actually titled "The Girl Next Door," the character is named after the film). There's a woman in the next room that he meets at a bar, and there's the woman in a bikini as well, who is not the sort of person who has the slightest interest in your every thought.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did see the movie about a year ago and really thought it was going to be the big, gory, nasty little "let's kill them" type of film. I found myself really looking at the movie, as if it's supposed to be a "what the heck is going to happen", and that is really unfortunate. It's possible that some of these characters were really low-income people, or that they were real people who ended up in a bad situation and didn't have a lot of resources with which to prepare this film, but as a whole, I did find myself completely unable to care about anyone, in this movie...  I didn't know where I was going or what to do with the movie until about an hour before the end. In all honesty, there was a really good, cute, innocent-looking, girl, and I found a lot in this film with cute girls, who were in a relationship with each other (and not just lesbian) and were being romantic towards each other. She even had one of my favorite lines in the movie that was a great love song to her friend, who I think was my favorite character, who is a lesbian, so it was a very hard decision to watch it...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping for another great film. I didn't care if the director was a good director, I had not come to understand why this film existed. In fact, there was an actor, played by one of the principal actors (Dale Stern), who was in the same scene as this movie. In some ways, one of these "star" actors should have been in "one of these films," so it was like they were in one of those movies I saw a few years ago when I saw "My Cousin Vinny," and they were pretty good. There was a great performance in "My Daughters," and I was looking for it. This is so incredibly awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like a piece of garbage with a bunch of dumb characters and unbelievable action sequences. There are so many stupid things that you get a headache trying to think of them, and it's only at the end of the movie that you see the beginning of the film. The ending is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. That is a movie you could actually watch and see a joke about.  I'm afraid, by buying this movie, I'll have to write this review in Japanese and show the English version to the clerk.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised at how bad of a movie it actually is. I had the opportunity to be at the Sundance premiere for "Shawn," and, in that film, it was just a matter of "if you were there for a one-day preview," and that was a film about some guy who made a movie. This is a film that comes out in about two weeks.  I actually managed to get a preview of it before Sundance. It was not in the same order. The only person on the committee is the original director, the original producer, who made this movie, and she's a relative of mine. Her first film was about a couple of friends and their lives. That was an experiment with a director who hadn't yet even made a film in his life and was writing the script from scratch, and he had been to film festivals. She came to Sundance in this film and she had never made a short film.   If you're a young film-maker, this is a nightmare.  The original film had a few good lines in the film and was shot in an interesting location with some kind of "film" style that made it seem that there would be some sort of poetic, poetic, independent-film style that might be better suited for this film, and it's almost impossible to imagine that the original film is actually available on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like "Breaking Bad", they're probably the only other thing that comes to mind, or would be the only movie to come to mind.  I loved "Breaking Good" as the final episodes of that show, I'm curious to see if it's better or worse than "Breaking bad". This is the only TV show that I've seen that has a really good premise and but it's just "Breaking good" or "Breakingbad". I wish I was in a position to write a negative reviews review about this show, it was a comedy and the ending is not a comedy or even that great. I don't think I have any good excuse for watching this TV show until I've gone through it and come out of it feeling "comfortable" with it. And at this point, I would just like to have some "Breakinggood", because I'm really concerned about the effect this show may have on my emotions, and on the viewers'. The end, at least at this time, is just that little bit more scary than a kid who could carry the backpack on his or her back, even though I've been told the end will leave the viewer "scared". I don'st think I would really have much of a psychological effect at all unless it's on a show or movie where the ending leaves you in a safe place with a great story and good acting, not one of these shows. The only reason this show got a 10 rating in the last movie was due to the fact that the cast of "Breaking" had a "family-oriented" ending. This is an entirely new show and I couldn't stop thinking about it being awful after I saw it for the very first time and it left me so confused that I didn't understand exactly what I was watching.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw a trailer for this movie about five years ago on MTV. I still remember what it said. It was a movie about "Liza". Liza was a really cool woman. I found Liza as Liza on this movie.butbutbutBUTbutbutbecause she's pretty good actress, she's got a few movies to do, and this movie is really a movie for the public, so I'm sure they're going to see a lot of it, and they'll get a good chance to see what kind of movie it was going to be, and for them, they'll decide whether it's pretty and cute or if it'll be cute and fun.  I've seen this movie three times. I really didn't like the first one, where they had a bunch of cute people, and there was a reason for that. In "Dress to Kill" we see a guy walking around with a towel on and a shirt on. And it's all about the guy having a movie like this and I thought it would be a comedy. There are some movies where you just put the kid in a white T-shirt and he's not going to have a movie, and it was pretty funny, and the movie "The Rockford Files" had one where a movie was based on a kid with his mom and dad having a play date for the day, and I liked that. The Rockford films were just based on the guy and his mom. Liza does not have a lot in the way of acting talent. She was pretty good at getting all that stuff out of her face and in her hair, she had that really feminine face. And her hairstyle is nice.  It has a nice flow. It's not the prettiest and pretty girl you've ever seen in a movie. And Liza's hair was really short.  Liza wasn't exactly the type of person who was cute, so this may have been the case with the first movie, she wasn't the type who was a chubby girl with long hair, or with short hair. So it's possible that it was a lot more of the look she's usually in, and she may have had the same kind of hair as she has now. I've been told by the director that she's gotten prettier, and that's really true.  She does have some facial hair. She's not a particularly pretty woman.  And in "Dressed to Kill",

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to think that I can be a good actor. I think that there are certain good actors that work with some of the good movies that were made with the late Frank Sinatra or just "The Rat Pack" movies, and I know the late Sinatra would have liked to be involved in the film. The only time that I really knew him was when I was writing "Rat Pack" and he was still alive, and he would have probably been able to stop me and tell me that he wanted to do this film. (I really can't imagine what he was thinking.) He wasn't on the phone when he called his agent to tell him he was interested in doing this film, didn't come to see it for several years, and didn't know if he wanted anything to do with it, so it was his choice to not do it, which I'm OK with, because I think this is a personal matter. If you are going to cast a movie, you cast the director and your best friend, and have him or her make the call. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on the lives of actors, but it is basically a collection of stories (a collection of actors).  We had a talk with the writer and he had this to say that he was going to bring a story to life, but he had a real vision for the movie. It was all about writing something more meaningful, so we didn't have much of an idea about how the story would evolve. We ended up waiting several months until we got a chance to see the finished product. And we have no idea what the movie is like when it is finished. I mean, who has ever really seen this movie?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the ending of 'Wish Tree', as the director and his team were able to create some hope for a sequel to this movie.  It's the same with 'Somewhere In Time'. I think that this movie just needs one more little scene, one more time to wrap everything up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be honest and admit that I've only seen the short film "The Perfect Man". That's a good movie that explains how to be just that. It has been very highly rated by other reviewers. If I was in the same position as this film, I'd just get this flick, because it was in an open DVD. This is probably for some reason the only way to watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing I can give this movie is the acting skills of Paul Newman. He was great when he played his own role as the late Paul Newman, and he and his co-star, Jimmy Stewart, were on-screen together for the 1958 film, THE CROSSING.  I hope that there was no conflict, or there was conflict, in this movie. It's possible that the reason was the length of the movie, since it's probably not very big.  In short, I was really angry when I saw Paul Newman on-the-screen. I am not a huge fan of the way he's portrayed in the first five "COP" movies, and the way they portrayed Paul Newman as a "small" man, as a cop, or even as a man and a husband. This was really horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the show, and I think they should just take it for granted that this show will continue for two more episodes, after which they can either decide what they want to do or if they want a short series or try to revive it again. If they want the short series, they can make one, but they are currently considering to just make a second season and have me wait. Maybe the show will never get over, and maybe I'm wrong and they will decide not to continue and I'm sorry for any of that.  I just want to point out that it was the first season and I watched it. I didn't understand why I was being forced to watch the second season.

And so, it, from the first time the movie is shown on television in Mexico, it will be shown in Spanish with subtitles. This is, according to the movie, because the director decided on this kind of presentation, he wants to create a different feeling about this film - which isn't the case.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is sad to see people like Mr. George Clooney or others in it because it's about a group of people who are trying to get the truth. We don't know who they are trying for the truth, they are doing it by chance. That's why they're asking you to support them by donating to a film like this one. That means they are asking you for the same amount of money they've already had (they've given a good portion of their time) to do this (it's hard to believe it's been that kind of support). The only reward you'll get for supporting this is that you'll have a little bit of an ego-boost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first thought is "How stupid can you be?" After reading the book, I found it to be quite sophisticated and very thought out, and I thought that the people at ABC were smart enough to think that this would be some sort of cheesy movie like some of the shows that ABC has done in the past (like the "WOW" show, "That '70's Show", etc)  I'm glad that they thought to get into the book and they were able to read it, because the movie itself is nothing more than a series of scenes from the book. To add insult to injury, the ending was so horrible that I didn't even bother finishing watching it and I'm really surprised that it didn't ruin the rest of the series on DVD (I was watching the TV show and I actually thought the ending would ruin the whole series).

The characters are, without exception, all bad. In fact, they are all the main characters in the film and only the last one of them is a main character. I couldn't take it anymore. It made me laugh. I saw it as a funny little movie about a film like "The Three Amigos" that was released earlier in the year, because they were not really "film characters".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my first attempt at a movie: I was very immature with my emotions and didn't even have a clue as to what was going on.

I can't even tell you what the hell I want to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of this movie was good, I knew the two leads, the characters were very good, and I was looking forward to it. In "The Blue," I don't know if the whole movie was a story or just the trailer, so I can't really say.  I'm surprised by how bad this movie really is, and then again, the director probably isn't the best actor. He's a young director who is probably still learning his craft and it's easy to think that he was still doing some kind of short film. It's funny to see some of the kids' videos and then I'm sure that this would look better than most of them, because they're a bunch of kids, and he probably wanted to make his film into a funny thing like "How to be a director" or something similar to that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was like The Godfather or Casablanca, just very expensive for the entertainment value of a really good movie. A movie doesn't have to be an hour long to be entertaining. The other actor was also good in the Godfather, did he make a similar comeback in the sequel.  The character in this film is, as you've seen, very stupid and his brain is just a little too big for him to pull off convincingly and it hurts his ability to act like a psychopath. The film is not just about the killer's psychology, it's about how he behaves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I'm a big, stupid person, so I guess it's obvious by now.

The top of town and the hills were pretty good looking, with the trees and the grass.   The upper part of the town was all-white, with a brown and grey strip of dirt, that looks like it was drawn in by hand by a poor artist. This scene was the first one, the one of the man being thrown off the train by the horseman. That scene was very pretty, and I can't imagine what was done with it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this would be a simple documentary about an actual film crew and maybe even a cast of characters. I am afraid that they really didn't have a clue how to make a film. I didn't even know they made a movie with a budget of $5 million. I also think that it is a little too violent because they don't even make a point of shooting the two leads. Even though they're killers, they're too scared to show a face of fear because they really don't understand fear and they donned a mask of "fearless courage."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had high hopes because this was a comedy about me and a buddy team (however, we had seen a similar movie called "The Naked Gun 2", which was the sequel to the first "The Nude Gun"). I had been very open to this type of movie with my friends, and that is what I had watched, in the nude. The first "Naked Gun" was about me having done it in my early days as an adult and my friends in the original, and was filmed in my old school classroom. I guess the guys in this one are like those "Nudist" who think that it's ok to have a movie on their own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad to be able to watch movies with the likes of Michael Jackson and Michael Caine. They did a great job portraying their rolesbutbut this movie was too long. It took two hours to get through a particularly bad scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie, not thinking too much about it. It's like "the film is for children".   The actors were very poor. They had an amazing talent for comedy. I don't know how anyone could make this movie good, not to mention funny or entertaining. Maybe the director was doing this movie for a film festival, I don. Maybe he just wanted to make fun of these people. Perhaps he was watching "Poker Night" with the same attitude. This was a completely unfunny comedy, with absolutely no redeeming quality. The worst way to watch this movie is with children under the age of ten. Even though the movie is supposed to be a comedy, there is absolutely nothing in the way of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a bunch of little people who are supposed to represent small countries. This movie, is about an entire island of the tiny people of Palau, in the Pacific, one of the most remote places on earth (if not the world)  I can't help but feel bad for the little people of that island, because it just wasn't right.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For me it was not a case of bad actors playing bad people who were bad, although in this case it was just the same people playing different parts of the same play. I'm glad they have all been cast as gay, though they do seem to be in "early days" as there are plenty of these films out there at this point. One reason for this is that the play, directed, and written are pretty good, though the movie has a certain "look" about it. For instance, I had a friend who was kind of "out of touch" with the world, and it was something she saw in the film with other people who didn't quite know who I was, and so would just look at me, and if I hadn't seen the film, and she wasn't too interested in the character, then that would have been the case. As an actress, it's about survival - it's survival in a strange world. And the way the character is treated is just very strange, to say the least, especially considering all of the things we have learned in the past 20 years, about what we do and how we act with and around people in the gay world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has its redeeming feature that it could give the character of "Duckie", the kid who went through the movie, who is a very good actor. It can be shown that "DUCKIE" has the right to make a movie about him. After the movie he's going to be portrayed as "DUNKEY" and I believe it is an insult to his character to continue to be cast in the movie. I'm a big fan of DuckTales and to see that the movie was made in a very short period of time really hurt the quality of the movie (you can only do so much with such limited time). I give it the very best that it had in the way of being a live action movie and hope that some one or two of the producers read the comments that I've put up about this film and came and watch it before they do. I'll keep you posted on the good part that I can. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie in this category is a crime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in my mid-40s now, so when I see these characters, I've got to admit that I'm not that young. They're in their mid-to-late 20s and 30s. They were very cute in those Disney shorts. I love those Disney cartoons. They are a little "ugly". I just didn't want to get too attached to them. This is a comedy, they're supposed to be a lovable bunch of characters with big laughs. I also didn't really like the "lick" factor in the "movie". I don't believe it adds a lot to the humor of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I am just one person who is a part of this movie, who doesn't know anything about this film and is looking for some plot and answers. So I will go to the comments section and say this:  The film is a parody of the film "Lion King"   The Lion King is one of the most successful animated films of all time. The Lion Man is based on the Lion Man in "Lions Man" (1998) by John Singleton, who made some very good short films, which were made in about ten years ago. The only good thing about this is that there are some Lion Man shorts in the world, which I did not see because I live in Japan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read a great deal of material on the subject, and this movie is absolutely one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It's not so much that the script fails to convey what the audience needs, but it's about every character that you ever meet is a complete mess. I could tell that it's supposed to be a real film. I would like to see the real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty crappy remake, which is a shame because a good one was done in the 70's with Robert Culp, or what some people call "The Naked Gun" series, which was a very good and intelligent film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to make any personal comments about the other films. I found myself turning the television to see how it looked. It is only because I am trying to be objective about what I was watching. That's pretty sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't had a problem with the movie, even seeing it in the store. I am still really angry that it happened. The film was in Spanish with some subtitles. Some people complained about this, even though I don't speak Spanish. They seemed to think that it would be funny, because I wasn't sure who would get offended or not, and if they did, they probably weren't going to see it anyway, and it was really stupid that the director of it. It doesn't matter that they tried to make it more serious or "comedy". I would recommend not to watch it, or to rent it again if they got the chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this movie with a bunch of friends that was about three years ago, and that's the only reason it's come back, and it did come with a sequel, called "The One Million Dollar Movie" or something of the sort. And the whole thing is so terribly conceived. The guy was so stupid. I mean, he didn't even know how to act! He had no idea how to play. He was very annoying. I was actually just reading his comments and saw he was from Chicago, or something, and I don't care what he has in mind, he's going to get fired at least once. This whole ordeal was the worst. And by the way, this was all in one movie, it only cost me around $2,000. I have no idea if this movie has the worst budget, so I can't make it sound any worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been waiting for this film for quite some time, and was expecting some major cinematic splendor. I had to see this movie again and see how it was actually made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm just looking at my copy of this movie and I don't know what happened to "The Godfather" series or "The Sopranos" series. I was pretty shocked when I found out this is a "comedy" film. There is some good comedy in there, there's a lot of good people in it, like Jerry Lewis, and people who were in the "Godfather" movies or "Sopranos," and I think there's also a good family movie here with Jesse and his father and siblings.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutthoughbutbutbecausebutbutalthoughbutbutwhywhywhyisitin the script.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think this movie was going to be that bad. I'm not a film buff, and the only thing I'm sure that goes in this is "Cinema 101" or some of the more obscure aspects of film making. The film was made for the Academy, so it makes sense that it would have to show how great the cast could have been, if the film did that, instead of "cinematic" (I won't call it that), the film just shows up like it did.  It just wasn't done, and that's why I gave this a rating of 1 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a complete mystery. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm a bit of a film buff, and a critic like myself. So I was curious as to what my film had to say about the film "Clerk" about a century ago. I have to say that when I read the book, which has already been translated into English, that it's quite graphic in the novel. I really can't imagine that it was the sort of movie that was released in 1922. The story is about a real person, not a fictional character, that really has nothing to do with the movie.  This is the first time I ever had to rent this film (not knowing how bad the movie was), I'm really disappointed about this movie. I was really looking forward to this film, the same thing as a lot of my friends.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie directed by a guy that I've never even heard of, I'm a guy. It was directed by guys in the US. And if you know anything about US movies, they all use US actors. This is not good for the US entertainment industry, if it's not corrected. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third time I've seen this movie (the first was just the one time and I was in love with the "Citizen Kane" script) and it's probably the closest to my age group, so I thought I'd go out to buy it and be surprised if they ever let me in. As it turns out, the movie is about 20 to 30 minutes long. I think they're hoping you'll give it a shot and that you don't go away and come back because they have a great story andbutbutbutBUTbutbut BUT this is the reason why I chose to go to the movie store. They have this big "T" shaped shelf that says it all about "THE CITIZEN KANE" in bold letters. The picture on the box that I got from the movie's distributor is more than an hour and half long. And I'm willing to bet that there are some people who would give me a chance to be in this movie, but that's not it's the whole story and this movie is not a movie that you could give to a child. I'm afraid that some people are going to think I'm just a big fan of "CITIZENS DAY" and I am not. I wanted to write a positive review about "GOOD GIRLS IN COLOR" and you can check out that movie and give it the 10/10 review and I'll give that movie a chance, it is quite good.  I was going to write this review about the last time that I went to the theater and was in the middle of it and that movie was great, and they show a scene where the mom says to her daughter, "Go see the movie of what you want to do to. It's really cute. The only thing that I think is not that cute is my daughter and that is because she is the girl who looks like she's 3 or 4 and I thought she would look younger"   They did a great job on that film, and if I had the opportunity to watch this movie I would recommend that people see it and not this one, if you do not have any particular feeling for this movie and are a fan of the good old days when this movie was made it's worth a look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, this movie is not intended to be about some kind of independent cinema, because it's not even an independent movie. It's supposed to be for a group of college students who are members of the Cineaste Club, which is a student-run movie group. And that group of students may be very good actors, like some of the other members of this movie (especially the members of IMDb). In fact, this is a very expensive movie, and some of those members of Cineastes Club could be getting more jobs than I would have expected. I'm not going to comment on that because I'm really just a college student and have no money in this industry. I'd like to thank some friends at CineCaste Club and Cine Club, and I'm sure I can find them on IMDb. I do know that it was made with the money of some members of our campus.  It's not meant to be a complete film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to watch this movie for two reasons: one, it was my first movie that I saw and I'm a movie buff and I didn't get to see my first one. And two, it's a remake of a movie that was about 15 years old at the time. I'm just old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't watched any other film that I'm in. It was my first film in the 70s.  The first film is very sentimental in it's presentation.  It's very interesting. I think. And a film like the one with Tom Robbins, where it has one or two good actors who play a good role in the supporting characters, would have been a great film to re-edit.    The film was edited very badly. One of the most interesting elements of the film was that there were some really good actors that were trying to get this movie made (they're not all that famous or well-known; they're not at the level of the great people like Tom Robbins or Peter Falk), so that's the reason why they're in the film with the other actors. It's like the movie was made by a film company to make money, and like I've mentioned before, this is something that was done as a labor of love. It would be a shame for anyone to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie seemed to revolve around me, and my character was constantly surrounded by people and they were either trying to convince me that she was "good," or to make her think she was, or whatnot. I did like the idea of the "happy ending," and the "perfect ending" of the movie, so I'll do some research and see what I can find out about the happy ending, and see if I have a "fiancé" waiting for me there. The movie was a very slow moving, very depressing movie that I would have to sit down and watch just to finish it. My friend tried to watch the movie again, and when I had her watch it, she said, "Did you see how I was doing in the movie?" When I had my date watch it to see what she'd do, she was laughing hysterically, she wasn't laughing with me. I have never been on any date where I thought of any movie, and just felt that it was just an awful date. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I bought it for $10 and had a lot of fun reading the book.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the late 70's/early 80's when this movie was released, there was some movie making wisdom to think that a big budget would be necessary to make this movie a success. Perhaps this is because there are so many different people involved in this movie--all who are trying to bring a message from all points of view but that might not help very much because the movie has very few scenes and is mostly just an hour-and-a-half of footage. It also lacks any kind of soundtrack--the camera moves on with no sound. In the early 90's there was a short film that featured a soundtrack that went over the entire screen--a good example of the kind of music that could be heard--this movie doesn't even have a soundtrack (although it does have a tape) to accompany the film.  It is a pity that this film isn't a "special feature" in any way, because they are just as poor as the rest of them.  This film, along with the other one starring Lorne Michaels, has been reedited by the TV program which also had "The Godfather" re-edited for a similar purpose. If you're going to make your money on such a short of a film, it's probably not going to do much damage--why waste the money on this one? The movie is so bad.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie where I saw how a girl fell to her death. I hope to heaven that I didn't watch that scene. In fact, I don't think it's right for me to see it. I was going to watch this movie with my girlfriend and then after seeing it I went ahead and rented it because I was just going to see if the movie is as good as it is at the box office.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I don't recommend watching this movie if you've never seen a true horror movie before. This movie is not a true story (if you don't think so). The only person who had enough courage to see this movie and speak to its director and producer, is one of the directors/producers of this movie. I would recommend watching that movie, or one of his other films or TV shows. One of the producers of this film was a great horror writer, and I thought this movie would be a great compliment to him and his work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was meant to be an action film that stars a big star like Schwarzenegger.  A young man by the name of John Bochner is the only one in the whole film. He is an actor that is in a drama school and works in an ad agency in Manhattan and works on a film every Sunday in a theater downtown and does not work on weekends and he has been acting since he was 9 years old.   If if you ever watch John Boher and he plays the part of a tough guy in a few movies, you will find that he is the most physically and mentally tough of all the actors in Hollywood.but but he does not have the knowledge, training, or experience to perform as an action star in this film. His character has no great dramatic appeal to me. John Bochy's character is a tough and strong guy that, like all tough guys should do; he can do a lot of things with his fists and kicks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out on the premise that it's a crime flick and that we're going to get to see the police. Then we're taken to the station and we see the guys in uniform and we're told they are police officers and we are shown what the uniform is all about. Now, let's put this in context, at the movie theater this is the most accurate version of events. The movie does a few things for its sake, it goes to the police union and gives the impression that they are a bunch of guys who are going to give their testimony in their uniform. After that, it's up to the viewer to make an evaluation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First, a very good review about how great the movie was going to be, "The Color Purple" has already done a lot of interviews, and has done so many other people.  So, people who watched the movie before the interview, probably watched it with the intention to find out exactly how good it was going. People with very specific intentions were going to find "The Purple" to be like a movie that would make them think of me, as it was supposed to be about, you know, the movie "The Pink" that I did a year ago.   I don't know if there were some big budget changes between the movie that was released in 1993 and "The Movie" that it came out in 1994, and I'm not certain of the exact nature of the interviews I did with "The pink" director, so I am in the dark as to why this, but I don a want to ruin this movie. And if it were my movie, I would not want it to be released any other way than to be the best that it could possibly be. But unfortunately, "Purple" has made many of the actors and actresses involved look like the lead, because they are wearing outfits similar to those worn in the interviews. I can't explain how it could be that these actors are just trying to make a movie look like "Purples", or how these two actresses who are so good look in these outfits that they look like they're trying to break into "Purps". I would like to point out some of the best, most gorgeous, beautiful women that are out there that are not in the "Purp" film, and these women are just beautiful, beautiful and good-looking. I don;t think that they're wearing these exact outfits. So, I think that the two women who are out in the world with these very short shorts are just naturally gorgeous, and that's their natural hair color, and what they'd look like in their hair color and make up.  The other actress is just an unbelievable beauty. I wish I could find a way to say it, but there was a time when I really liked the way that she looked. I thought that she was so beautiful, very beautiful in her hair, and the way she was blonde, blue eyed, red hair, brown eyes, and blonde, I don"t think she has ever looked more hideous than in this film, so she looks very unnatural and horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is really no reason to recommend this movie because nothing in it makes any sense whatsoever... It's just another B-rated movie. If you can't watch it, don't bother to watch it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was released to the general public. I had only seen the trailer, which was an advertisement for a bad-rated movie. When I found out about this movie's release, I called them. They told me, "It was such a huge hit." When I actually saw the film, I was not a fan of the movie. In a way, it's as though I had been watching a terrible version of The Sixth Sense. I thought it would be different, so I just saw the movie after doing some research on it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must say that this is one of the few films that I've seen that has actually been released on DVD. That's probably because they were interested in it. This is the third movie that I'm watching because the first was a musical (A Charlie Brown Christmas) and the second was "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", the first being from 1969, and the other is the Disney Classic Collection (the original) and was released as part of the DVD package. The third film is released in 1990, so the original release of this is from the late '60's. I really liked "Who Cried Roger Rabbit" in the second release and I liked the second one very much, so that was released in 1969 and had a soundtrack. The other one was also a musical and had it's own soundtrack, so I just wanted to point this out.  And, if you remember, that had a lot of songs that were available on the second "Who framed Roger Rabbit". Those were really great.  "The other" had very little. I think "Who did Roger Rabbit' was just a good story and I enjoyed that version, so this is a Disney Classic Classic Collection, but the same basic story is told in the third.butbutbutBUTwithbutbutdifferent music (which is only a few songs).  As a matter of fact, I've noticed that it is available as a VHS tape on the Disney Store DVD. The first one was the "Disney Classic Collection" and the soundtrack was the only thing on it. I think Disney just decided to release this version with the new version of the Disney Movie Title. The original was only available on VHS, so in the same way as the first movie, I think it was just released for the first time on DVD, because it was only a single version with just the title and "Who Did Roger Rabbit"? (the version with all the songs and dialogue)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My thoughts are not in the right place, what I see is one of my worst characters ever. It's worse than the worst episode of any other series I have ever seen. This is a series that should have been the best of the decade. I will never look upon this series the same again, and I'm sure you've read the previous reviews of other series, this one is a "complete" waste of time, and not in any way entertaining or good. In fact, it's an insult to any intelligent person's intelligence to waste one moment's worth of time on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it might be that they were trying to imitate the great film, "Rosenberg," which came out in 1957, but who knows how the great Albert Einstein's life would have been compared to what they're showing in this movie, and it's hard to think they're portraying him as anything but Albert Einstein. He was a brilliant, but he was not a recluse, and he didn't make it out of his own accord. He never went to Harvard, and I think that he might have had some kind of personal relationship with this man, which is why he would have shown his face. I don't think they showed him, because I'm sure they were afraid of what kind of impact it would have. The real Einstein would have gone to the university in a body and made a statement that, to me, he would've made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What does this movie have to say? I don't know if there is a film that has the exact same name, I don. I did read that this film is going to be about an epic tale about a king and I think that's the kind of film that I would see. That said, what's a girl do if she doesn't see this movie? I am curious as to why they made this movie. I don`t understand how a girl (or man for that matter) can go through this film and recommend it to anybody who has not seen it in its entirety. It is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what it is. There's nothing to like about it. I was sad at the end. It was very slow, and it took me a while to understand what it was trying to do. I thought it would be much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I rented the film it was playing on TV and was just going to see how it was going to be. It was only about a week later and I decided to rent it and go with the flow.   I'll say for the last few days I was on the phone with the director and he was telling me to wait for the film to come out on VHS and was asking for a hold on his VHS copy of the film so I was going through the tapes at home and I'm hoping that I didn't get the copy that he sent me and it would have been a really depressing VHS, but I didn.  There's really nothing to say for it except that I really didn't like this film at all. I've read this and done this before and I've seen it with a lot of people who I've said "I liked it". I really did think that it would be a very long, and I still think it's going to take a long time. I think that people don't realize just how long the movie is and I thought that it might have some nice twists and turns. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The actors, the dialog, the plot, the timing, the acting was absolutely atrocious. I mean, I knew that they were good actors (because I knew them from SNL). I had actually gone to see the SNL episode that featured them, and when they were done playing the game, they had already started making this movie. I had to sit through the entire movie. After the opening 30 minutes, I went back and watched SNL, which I was kind of expecting to see, and I felt like I was sitting on a plane going back to the States, when I sat there, I felt so bad for the characters. I wish I could give this movie 10 stars for a truly great work of a great movie. The end result of this movie was to make you smile, I guess, as I saw the "D" rating (yes, even that) in the comments. The ending could have made a difference, even. I felt the movie had a "Hollywood moment" at the end of it. It was very painful to watch, not worth it. If you've ever been a teenager and you loved the show, you will get a laugh at the ending, and you will remember it, because there were so many funny moments throughout the show. It's so strange how it works that a movie like this is so different than the show! I didn't find it funny and I never laughed once. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love Montelvivue's version, and think this version was made for him, as well as another Montelvin, which was in turn for the director.  The other part is that this is an independent film made by a filmmaker who has had little money to make his film, and in this case the independent filmmakers are really taking a risk to go in on such a low budget, and as it happens, their films don't receive as much attention. The first film had more of a following and a very large budget, with much more money spent on it, and the result was a film about a lot more characters and characters and bigger conflicts.  This film has a budget and the only reason it's on a screen is to "show it off," and the cast's acting was terrible.  One of the major reasons for this is that Montelvoie's character is so unlikable, and he doesn't understand that he should make his character likable, because that's the reason that you're supposed to have sympathy for him in the first place. His characters are so wooden and lifeless, and that's not the kind of film that a good story can be made out of.  It really goes from bad to worse, and honestly I think it's very, very, disappointing. You have a guy who has been in love with this lady and is trying to make her understand, as he puts it, that it's an "out there" kind of thing...  If you can read the comments here at IMDb, people say it was like that when Montelmoie first saw her, so you know what you're going to get. The good thing is that he is obviously really cute and really good looking (the film's official website is showing this one, for example), so you'll want to watch this, and you'll see how he tries to get his story to make sense, that's another story altogether.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It wasn't that bad. The acting was not that good, the scenes weren't real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got curious about it because I was interested in watching the film which is not as popular as some of the movies that have been made about it, like the best one ever made. I thought, 'If it was a bad one, it might be really bad'. It doesn't make the case that it is a film that deserves to be called 'The best'. I don't really understand what the other reviewers have against this film. This is a totally bad film, even worse than 'Travelling with Mona Lisa'. What happens is that it tries to be funny or pretentious, which is obviously its aim in this project.  The only thing that this film can really be compared with is "TravellwithMonaLisa" and that is because it's an American film (like the 'Mona Lisa Trilogy') and I guess it's like that movie which was made in London, which it's basically like a really old piece of trash that should be buried. And no wonder for such a 'trademark'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a complete waste of time, a real disgrace, that this film is so utterly vile that I'm actually laughing through the whole thing, as the plot is so poor, with so much going on that, I have to admit that I felt I was watching a horror movie, or some kind of horror film, with this film. If it wasn't for the fact that it was released in the summer, I don't think anyone would have given it the slightest interest in me ever getting the film. What a terrible excuse for a film, that the writer should have the sense to put up a movie called "Carnival". It's a sad and depressing mess. The only redeeming thing in this movie is its acting, which is quite good, and I didn't like this at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't know what this movie is trying to be a horror movie or a comedy. The only thing I know that it is a comedy is the fact that in the movie a lot of guys come out to the dance floor to the tune of a female lead.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I was completely out of it" after just watching this movie. I did watch this at the hotel, and was able to have a few beers with a couple friends. It would be great to say that the movie was good. The acting of the two leads was bad. In general, the two characters are completely unlike the two. They seem to be nothing alike. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can honestly say that it is as bad as a bad sequel. It does give some credence that this is an indie film in an independent film world that I don't recommend you see this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it's not like I'm a religious fanatic and all those stupid "sources" out there to find out. So, there were a couple people who were still in there to see me, I mean... "holy" or something... It was just... I wish I didn't have to be honest with myself.  I'm not making a statement that this was the greatest movie of all time... It wasn't.  There are a couple of good actors out there (like Jim Belushi in "Space Cowboys") who are just good actors. This is one of the worst movies that has ever been made. It's just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never read this book, and am not aware what the story was all about. When they gave it to me for the DVD I felt cheated. They have never given a bad review review about this movie, or about a movie that has been made by the same director or made in any other way, or done any differently by anyone else. I am an avid movie buff and have nothing but respect for John Singleton and the actors he has directed. And so, I find myself watching this with a heavy heart, a feeling of being cheated by the people involved in this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good movie here is the end of the world that I believe will have a few good extras. The director really needs to learn how to make movies for less than three hours in length. This is the only movie that made it to me on VHS, so I had to buy it from Amazon. I am not in a rush to get back into it, or pay for this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie with friends. It's not that it is awful or anything. It does have a horrible ending. That's because one of the two main characters, Kevin, is now deceased, and the other is his best friend, Tom, and they're now in a relationship.  I found that my favorite actor, Ben Affleck, was dead when he appeared in the movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have the misfortune of seeing this, there is a good chance you are topless, and no matter how you look, you're going to look like an object. I don't know about you but if you've ever been to a porn store, you'll know what it feels like to walk around naked. It might not be the first thing that comes to mind, considering that I've always been the sort of guy who doesn't care about looking at a naked chick, but that's the price of a "porn movie" and if you're not a masochist (because that's how they sell this kind of film) then this one's for you, or at least, a masque. In an interview, my friend did say, "I'm gay and this is the first movie I ever saw," and he was actually correct. He wanted to have it made as an "adventure," and the "adventures" and sex scenes, because he's from Texas and he thinks they're more popular in that kind of movie. That's just me. I'm not sure why they'd go for this kind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For someone who knows what the inside of an actor is, seeing the actor on the screen is beyond painful, just the worst movie ever made. It was made by a bunch of students at the University of Southern California, and there is nothing good to say about it, save for one or two "funny" scenes.  The "twinkie" is probably the best actor in the film. There are about twenty people in the entire movie. In a short, this was made on a weekend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really got its name from it's title, 'The Incredible Journey'. What I can say is that this is not really 'The Journey'. When you watch this movie, you have to get on the bus and ride. You can't drive a bus or drive a horse. So, you've got to get a bus and drive to your destination. You might want to stay out of the city as well.  I have a friend that goes back and forth from Los Angeles to Hollywood every weekend (he's an actor/actress, and an award-winning actress). He was in the bus for two days on this movie. He was on the back of a bus with me, and he was actually the driver when he was out and about, so I had to drive out to Santa Barbara and pick him up and bring him back in Santa Barbara. It was really kind of a 'Buddy Bus'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really have to watch the movie again. I found the ending "good." I can't understand what was going on in the last couple of weeks. It might be that the movie isn't available on DVD right now or that the guys are just so hot in their videos, like a porno. I'll never understand why guys would take their own lives, or commit suicide, or turn into a sex-trade worker, or anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's all about making money and it's really sad to see that the movie could have been a really sad movie and I didn't like how they chose the characters. There were plenty of good characters in the movie, and I'll definitely say that there are good characters and that I was a fan of a movie called "The Dead Zone"  There was one good character in the film called "Rick" who died in the original series (and there was a good performance of the actor in that movie). There is a good woman in "The Walking Dead".  The bad decision was that they didn't do that on the cover of this movie and this is the only way I can think of it and I'm so glad they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I watched this, I found this movie to be a pretty good satire of the war, as the film was called "The Good War," or something similar.  I believe this is a very different film, I really don't recommend this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As for this movie, I thought it was going to be like a parody or a spoof or something about the famous "I love you, kid" movie (The Parent Trap, that is also a movie in which kids appear to be playing pranks on parents). And I thought that the movie would be about what it was "I Love you, Kid" and would also be about the typical movie where the movie begins with a scene of a couple being married, like, with this movie the kids start coming around and I mean "coming around".  That is not all, though; the kids from this movie are the same age as the characters in the movies I like to call "The Parent Traps", and so there you have it; children in pranks and children in their school uniforms. I'd like to say that the kids are playing tricks with me, not that I have seen or ever had any problems with children in school uniforms playing tricks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is probably the most boring movie of all the "Dirty Dozen".  It's very strange, strange, and just plain odd. It's not even funny, or good enough to call it "dirty Dozen", or even "Drama".  The ending of the movie is about three minutes long, and the whole movie is a mess. The "Dirt Dozen" was like the "Truckers Dozen 2". And I'd rather watch it in a theater. It just doesn't end the way you want it to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just about five years ago. There was a period when people would pay for a movie just like this in the mid-'90s, which I remember very well. When you see the film in the theater, it was still in its original format, which means there are three of the original actors in the film (Jim Belushi, Paul Belushi and Peter Boyle), which is a very small group of people who knew Paul Belush when he was still alive. When Paul was still around, he had already filmed "Paul" which was a short film directed by Steven Soderbergh and released by his production company, Soderberg Film Productions.  Also, they have no clue how to treat the actor, especially since he was not there to learn how to do his own voice over work (i.e., to learn to sing, or read, or to act in the original movie), but just the standard "Paul Belush" treatment in terms of "Paul-as-Paul" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what it is about but if you have a low opinion of me, that would be the only reason to have read this review. It is pretty obvious that I haven't read anything remotely serious about this movie. The movie is so bad it isn't even funny. It's all about the ending, and the end is so horrible, it is hard to watch the whole thing. The way they show the characters and then cut it up and make it a sort of comedy show is also bad. I am not trying to be harsh on this movie for a few people who had read the book (like in the book). There is actually some really funny parts in it, like how the movie is about how they are trying to make this movie a romantic comedy about how stupid the movie ends up being, I'm not going to watch any of it. It was supposed to be more serious. There is nothing to be taken seriously about this. If you have any interest at all in seeing it, I would suggest going to this movie's source material.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm only 26. I was in the process of getting my own movie with this one. This is the only movie I've seen of the entire "Masters of Horror" series, which is not just horror in general. This was, apparently, produced by a couple of people who are not particularly interested in the subject matter. The subject matter is quite graphic. Not only does it discuss incest, but it does so at an early age, at the same time as it discusses child abuse, and other topics not exactly conducive to children's education. If you have children, you know how scary it is to talk about sexual abuse, particularly about your child being raped and the shock you would feel at what goes on there. I hope this will not be part of "The Masters of Horror," "The Masters of Madness," or any other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been very skeptical about the DVD box. I wanted to see a little bit of my movie. "A Christmas Story" is on a lot of TV. I was very disappointed. I hope you get to see "A New Story" which is great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been reading about how great the movie was, about how I was going to be amazed and impressed by it and how it would touch the hearts of everyone, that's all the movie does. The plot of the movie is so predictable and stupid, it makes the movie even worse and worse. There are no characters in the movie. I was very angry and disappointed by the movie and the whole movie. The ending of the film had some very great acting and some very wonderful moments. I can't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do not understand how someone could possibly get a job in Hollywood, I'm in shock that the movie was made in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the original "Ace in the Hole" which ran for eight years, and even though it was an exploitation flick, the show, called "Aces", was about my hero, Gary Busey, an ace who was shot down in World War II.  The show, "Ages", is about an ace named "butbutbutBUTbutbutButbutbutandbutbuttheybutbuttheirbutbutbecausebutbutyetbutbutthebutbutthoughbutbutdespitebutbutabutbutofbutbutonething".  It's not a good movie. You never know what happens. Maybe it's a bad guy who's gonna get killed by a bad actor. Maybe you're gonna get shot by a mad person. Or get hit by a car, or fall in a ravine, or get struck by lightning. You're gonna go crazy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first movie, "The House with the Black Cat", the cat was killed off by the first shot (the one with the guy). It was the cat's old owner, not a cat who had lived there for twenty years. In "The Cat with the Sunburn" (the other film), the old owner is still alive. He lives in a nursing home, so the sunburned cat is in a new nursing home. And he can't really stand the cat. "The house with the blue cat," which was the next movie, has the old cat who was the victim of a previous incident and has never been able to shake off the cat to this day. He is the one who's not able to give his cat the basic comforts it needs; the house needs to be cleaned, and cleaned daily, and the cat needs a litter box in the same room with the old one.  If they hadn't already had his cat in a hospital, they would be taking it to a new home, which is just too soon. And the hospital has a much better quality of life for his cat who lives there, he gets to go to the vet regularly and he has a chance to make his life better.  The cat's caretaker has not changed his living conditions and has to deal with an animal who hasn't been able, as a human, to learn how to get along with them in the time it will take.  In one word:  It doesn't work.  I was surprised that someone would even watch this movie with the intention of making me happy. It doesn`t make me feel as though I`m living with a cat, and that's why, of course, I turned it off. This is one of the worst movies ever made, I don't know how you can recommend it to anyone, don't see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not recommend this movie to anyone with a very active conscience. I give it a 3 out of 10 because I gave a rating of 10/10 to the movie of the same name. This film was a great way to explore the world.but but I had to watch this because I needed some actual knowledge of the world I don't really feel like I was able to digest it. It's not a comedy, it's a horror film, not a horror movie, not even close to the best of the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like the original series of "B" (which is the third season, if anyone knows what I am talking about) about these episodes, because they are all about the adventures of B. The series "B", was like a mini-series (so to speak). This was the first series of the original four series (B) and I don't know if the later series, the fifth series, had any episodes titled "B".  This mini-story is a bit sad (in my opinion), especially after the show had shown that in the first story, when they met in the hotel room at the end of the episode, that they had been separated for some time, so I guess there is some sort of emotional interest in it. This is the only story of the entire show (or two mini-stories) that is not from the fourth series, and there are two reasons why. The first reason is because of the need to focus on the relationships, and since the previous mini-plot is such a touching episode, it would be easy for them to focus in on the sadness of losing the other characters, and the "B: Part 3" is so much better than this one. It was like an action thriller! I mean it. The two main characters were amazing in the original show, and they deserved to be rewarded for this, so they should be rewarded here, as well.  The second reason is the story is not centered around a bad guy. We are told in the show, that B is an orphan who left home, that he has gone to a school for the deaf, so we get to see more about him, how he gets introduced to the other cast members, and about all of them meeting him in the school. The bad guy, on the other hand, didn't have much to do and was more of a joke. He had a bad haircut, which I have since shaved his hair back, and he was not introduced with any sort of character development whatsoever.  I'm not too big on the fact that the writers had to make the decision on the fate of the bad guy being "dead".  And this show did not do the show justice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was filmed at the same time as the first, so in the same place. It was filmed on a big, empty stage. That, plus the fact that it's one of the smaller shows means it is not as big as, say, a full size car. It also has no more than two sets (or, in the case of the car, two seats), and has no better than one set of actors, who are actually in the theater, making the movie, with a cast that includes an unknown number of extras.  I think this movie was shot in the spring. There is no reason to assume that this movie, which is set in the fall, would have been any different, and as I said before, I believe this is the third and final film in the "Carrie" series, and this one doesn't have "Carie" as a running title. (Carrie was the first movie's star and the second was the last one, and her first, second and third are in the main theater; she was supposed to be in the movie with the director and the other actors). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think the people in this movie knew that there was an Oscar season. I remember I was in the theater, and I think it was for this film, watching for the movie I saw the casting of this movie. The movie, from my perspective, is the story of two familiesbut does not make it a film of the Academy Awards. This movie is about some sort of Oscar special. It doesn't have any of the actors, the directors, and the Academy Award nominees. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not funny, it is a waste of time. It doesn't make sense in the slightest. All this movie was worth was 10 minutes to a minute, if you could believe my story and characters. Please watch it for what it is supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the DVD, I thought that "Ella" had some fun scenes that were probably from "Eleanor," with her big sister in "Ethel." I don't think that this movie has any "fun," or it really is just a bad film. It is just "very slow" and dull. It just goes on and on, with very little change in scenery, and then the soundtrack goes on. It's all just very "tricky" to watch, and I don. It will be very easy to ruin with good actors, which is what I tried to do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film after watching "Koya-B's" "Tiny Tots" (1993). I was surprised to find out that it was made before "Tinie Tempah" and before "Little Shop of Horrors". (I knew it would be a sequel and so I didn't think it would have a sequel with the same title since they would have to change the title.)  Although this is the second film in the franchise, I thought it was appropriate to compare this to "Koyo-B" in my review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw a little bit of the film before I purchased this DVD. I was surprised by the amount of money that was spent on this DVD, not to mention the poor quality of this DVD! The video is simply awful. Even when the camera pans slowly you can tell there is no value to it. I mean, the video was made for a very, very low budget and nobody at Paramount should ever make a movie like this. If they do, I guarantee it would be the best piece of art they have ever created, period. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A young writer for the National Lampoon in his first movie was asked if the movie was about some new prankster type guy who'd be a funny figure. In the book this happens, and it was my choice. He gets to write a "real" story about a real butbutbutbutnot real character. I don't really get that it's not a "film" movie because of the fact that "It has to have a story to tell." When I got this movie it came in a very nice DVD box, and I didn't see it in a theater in the USA, but it seems they actually had it in Mexico, or possibly I would see it and give my opinion about it. I think the DVD is a good format to view this film and there are a lot of "real actors" in it. There is this young "writer" guy, who I mean just finished high school and is just getting his start as a writer, who is not exactly known for being good at any kind of story-telling, nor his ability to make the best of a bad situation, which is what it must be like to work in a low-paying restaurant, a warehouse, or work on a movie that has been put together, I'm afraid. I'm hoping this guy does a lot better than he did his first "work." The young writer gets the benefit of the doubt, because this "film-making" world is not known to have very great taste in film-making films. This may be a case of the "unseen" or something else. It's also a case where the guy can get his first taste of screen writing (and I was going to say this is probably his first film as well), and he should just go along with this young guy. It is very interesting, and butbutBUTbutbutBUTBUTbutBUT BUTBUT BUT is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens with a group of men on an island. They all look like they were cast for a beach movie...or a soap opera...and when the island is explored by a couple of local boys, they find it pretty dry...like it was made from castoff tuna (note the costumer). The island is made from two small pieces of plastic, so we can assume the costumers did the island justice...like they did for the beach movie.

It was the film that I saw for the benefit of a friend, and to which she was in charge.  This is the movie I saw, and I can't say I enjoyed it, there is a scene that's between two characters, where the guy in the middle runs away and is chased by a girl.  I've never been good at acting and this scene is my #1 favorite in it's own right because it's so awful, very ridiculous, and so poorly done, that it's painful to watch. The acting is so amateur. Even if you are in a small role in a bad film, it is not worth sitting through a few minutes of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was so terribly done. The actors were horrible, the story awful and terribly horrible. It's not funny, not worth your time. You're gonna spend a bunch of money watching this movie, which you shouldn't. And the only good thing I can say about this movie is that the ending has some really awful actors playing themselves, but I'd rather watch that movie because it has some stupid and pathetic people play themselves, and they're acting like really, really pathetic actors.  I've never heard anything remotely likable about this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To say, the movie is only eight minutes long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are not very good and they don't seem like they have much chemistry. I don't know if they are doing the same thing from the first movie or if they haven't heard the book by now, so I'm not going to read the first book and judge it the same as the movie. I'm surprised that some reviewers here at IMDb.com have actually seen the first film and have not seen the other one, so to avoid reading the IMDb reviews that try to compare them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was just released in the States and had only one copy to the UK. Also, if you've been to any film festival this year, you'll know that the film festival line-up is pretty small compared to the US one. It is just an excuse to get a film off the ground, which I'm sure is a bad move for all involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like a horror film with the same plot. I think it's better that I just had to spend 3-4 hours on the film.but there's a reason why it was released on video, because I don't want to waste my time or money on this awful thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't have a clue that this was going to be a big movie. I knew it would be like another one of these dumb movies I've seen before, like the other Dumb Cop movies. Maybe this movie would make me laugh or something like that. If that happened, then it would take place on the other side of the coin where it's not being viewed by me today.  The only one thing that I have a high opinion of is that it was a comedy, so I'm going to recommend this movie to people who are really into dumb comedy movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I think that it's important for a good film to have some kind of plot, I have not read or seen anything that has made it obvious how to make it all happen. I am not the only one who will be affected by this. This film is not very good film at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if it's on TV, because I don;t have cable. The worst part about this film is that it's just like some crappy movie you can get on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry, but if the only thing that I cared about was to watch the ending and to see what happened, this is the only movie that i've seen with Michael.  He was a major lead in the second movie, in the beginning of the movie, with the "I am Michael!" TV commercial. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't seem to take off in the way of being funny, or even very silly. It has been a few years since this movie was made and people are more accustomed to the "B" comedy style, and so if you were to look at it now (which, in the past, it's worth remembering) this movie seems to have been filmed in the 1990s with a "B style" editing style. It's all done in the movie. If you're a real comedy buff you're going to find the most entertaining part of the movie in that "B Comedy" style. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of the show and I know it will make some people happy. I know that people from other shows will be happy with this show. I mean, it's a big show. And I don't want to get into it, since there are so many different actors. And the one thing that was made clear to me was the fact that the "WOW" factor (if that would be called that) was gone, and that was the reason that it made me curious about the show, because I'm an idiot. If you're an idiot, you get to sit in the audience for some of these "Wows". I'm only a fan for those who can appreciate the show. As it is, I'm going to say that it was too low in the "wow factor", and there is a reason why I'm trying to give the show a 10. Maybe it's because the show is in the middle of a break, and people are just getting back into the work flow after such a long hiatus, which leads to people losing their sense of urgency. There are some people who get so angry at me, and they may have more of an issue with it.  There are other actors who have some of that effect. I don-   It's just an easy fix. Just because it's so short of "wow". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't see this one at the theater because the day it opened I was a big fan of the director's films. He was good at directing an original version of 'The Big Lebowski' and the fact that he had created the original version with the actors playing the roles. This one was the only one of the first few that was made in 1976. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be a comedy, not a horror, and is being released in a box from Universal. The DVD cover for this film is "SOLITAY", so what is going to be in stores? The DVD is also limited to 3 hours, which is even in stores (I got one of them, so that was three hours). The DVD was originally rated PG, and this film was released by Paramount in 1998, so it's been out for 7 years. I guess I'll just have to sit this one out, as well as the other one for the same reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is actually supposed to be the most realistic. It's supposed to deal with the impact that a terrorist attack would have on a small community. The problem is that the actors in this movie are supposed to have been completely different characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to watch the film, and I was able to laugh. There were some great moments during the 60's and 70's where I remember watching films of mine from the 70's that were spoofs of 60's Laurel and Hardy shorts.  I think this is more of a parody of Laurel and Holly shorts. It's funny to see Laurel and Dick Huddleston. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how it happened but I've read that a lot about movies at The Library, and I don a lotta about movies, but the story itself is bad. It's not funny, and has no real reason to exist in its own right, with a bunch of other people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been called a documentary, I think it's appropriate for this forum to discuss it. I don't think you can be an objective reviewer about this movie, if you were the type that you could just say:  "Hey, I watched this movie and I know what I'm talking about!"  I have to say that, I have seen this movie. I'm watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the first half of this movie I was able to compare the performances. There was no comparison at all. They tried to make the second half a drama with some really interesting supporting characters. I am hoping they will get some help from other actors here, this movie was a very painful movie. The script is horrible, with no redeeming qualities and the supporting actors were awful. It was so bad, not even the ending was funny, horrible, and boring, if it were not for some really funny moments in the first 30 minutes. I wouldn't recommend it. I was really really looking forward to seeing this movie because it's not that bad, I thought it would have been really funny. The ending alone was worth the experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is sad about this movie is the fact that it is about a bunch of people trying to accomplish something meaningful or good.  I'm going to try and do my best to talk to as many of the members of The Black Legion as possible, so keep your eyes peeled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is trying to create a realistic view of events in this movie.  The movie starts right where the director was left off in the previous one (around the end of the "The Omen III"). When the film is over, it will be interesting to compare the movie to the final "The Silence Of The Lambs". I'm not sure that the movie has a purpose or purpose like it was originally supposed to be. I guess it was made to shock the public, to entertain people, or to somehow express my feelings about the Omen series.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing redeeming this film is the ending. I can't imagine a person wanting to see this film after watching the "Making of" documentary, and if you liked the ending to "The Sixth Sense", I can tell you that the conclusion is just as haunting, but not quite as effective. The reason for this is that the actor's own facial expressions become completely static, with no sense of any sort of emotion or even a genuine emotional reaction. I'm a sucker for the "Third Person" style of directing, and I really enjoyed that style of film, which is not the "third person" style that this film tries to imitate. It's an almost completely static face with no facial expression, which makes it impossible to tell the character's emotions and personality. The whole film is basically a study in grief and horror.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a comedy at all, and it isn't funny.  It's just stupid. There are so many things in this movie you could try to make it better. A great actor and great comedy could make this a good movie about the old fashioned cowboy who is as wild as he is brave. I was hoping this movie would be about a brave, daring, daring movie about a great cowboys adventure. I don't know what the heck I was thinking. It is just so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is, in fact, a remake of the original movie, which I can't help but think that it was the same movie all along. There is very little continuity between the movie and the book, which is the only reason I can see to watch this movie (though, I still have to write it down as a movie first). That's a shame because I was very curious and hoping that a movie based on the book would have the same quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got my DVD player from Amazon, the only other one with it. The other one is the true treasure, though I wish it would come out on DVD. I am sure that it will be out. For now, all I can really say is that the documentary is so bad it should be called 'It's a thing'. It is really really bad. This is truly embarrassing. I thought this would be funny, and this movie was supposed to be about a very politically correct film. So what do you do, in the end, do you actually like that guy? He is supposed to turn around and be the "anti-establishment" guy, a 'hobbyist'. This guy looks like the kind of guy that would be really stupid.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of other reviewers have said, and I have to admit, I don't really know what kind of movie this is, or whether it's going to be made in the next year, let alone the next decade. In my opinion, it's best to look for the movie that it's making next, because the film was going to get into some very dark corners, and it's good to see them back in the light.  IbutbutbutBUTbutbut BUTbutbut but, I am still very unhappy with the ending of the movie, and the entire movie is pretty much a story of trying to make up for a mistake. I can't really describe what was going through the director's head when he saw the movie back in 2006. It was a really weird, confusing and almost like a dream/hallucination type movie, or something. I think they wanted to show a bunch of things in that scene, and that's not really going to happen. I guess it was my choice to watch the movie with friends (if you can call it that) who were actually in the theater with me, and they weren't as good as I was, or they didn't have the same access to the material as I did, but that was really the only time I'm really going out of my way to avoid it.  There are lots of different styles in horror films, and there are no movies that can really be termed a "modern" horror film (I'm not counting the early seventies). Maybe this is the only one I'll see with the director and writer of the "director's" name, so I'll watch it with a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that bad because some people have seen the movie (maybe they're the only people) or maybe they think that the movie is so bad. I think it was a very unfortunate decision, because it's not just about one man, there are hundreds of thousands of people involved.  I believe that we, as a society, should get over it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was released on DVD on the 10th of July. In a month, I watched it on my VHS. Why? I'm an indie movie director, I can't imagine my career success. This film is a very dark movie, and the characters are completely devoid of any redeeming quality, and, to quote the director, you can call it "art".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story itself is good, and there are some funny lines and some moments of comedy, and you see some funny scenes of the movie. It's about 40 minutes in all, so there's a lot of material to work with. There are, however, quite a few characters in this movie, and they are about all the characters in the movie right now, all of whom appear to be from the same town, in the same village, in northern England. I have seen quite a number of British TV shows and, in general, I do not think that British TV is as big of a production team as American TV, or that they all wear the same kind of clothes. In fact, this is a small town, the setting, the weather, and the characters all make it look as though it was shot in England. It was not really made for the show (not in that sense) and was filmed in the countryside.  And, I think the film would be better suited to a country setting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not saying this is a great movie. I'm just saying this movie is a low-rent remake of "Scoop" -- so, to quote the other reviewer, "a poor-man's Spike Lee's remake of Spike Lee."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dark Night" has been used as a concept to describe a horror film.  The film itself is a "dark night" movie, and the night is the only time it actually gets dark. This movie doesn't take advantage of any time period or genre that it should take advantage.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie had a big city (where I lived) and we had many people that I had known for years. The people who were killed in the second film were people that didn't know I had died in my youth. Some of the movie was quite disturbing, and some of the killings were in the first movie's style.  The people in the movie were like us, very poor actors and actors who should have been in their second film and should have died.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not for the younger crowd. I was looking at the box thinking, oh, the film would be about this, and I was very happy with my first movie in this very weird movie theater, maybe I was naive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third attempt of the series to "bring the family together". If you were hoping for the second series, you'll be disappointed. This film is full of cliches and over the top moments, and I would definitely recommend a friend to spend a few hours with me and explain to me why this film exists and how it could possibly be funny. As for the other characters, it's pretty obvious that they're supposed to be friends in some form or shape. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a comedy. It starts out with a funny, slapstick, '60's inspired, spoof. I wouldn't be surprised to find some of this stuff on the internet, or even in the first season of MST3K. And I'm not going to give you a list of what I've found out about old film. It's a good look in black and white, and the "60's" look is nice, I like that it's not an older movie, because I was raised on the '60s, the 60's look is actually closer to the new 60's. The 60's "MST3k" episodes are not. I do love MST2K and the original episodes, and those of the '40s, '50's, '55's, and '60' look. It looks like a 60's show.   It's not even in "a box," it's just a DVD. I'm sure that the writers, producers, and animators are extremely good and well known, and would be the first to admit they didn't create the show in a week, nor did they expect the 'MST2k' show to be a '60'. It's just really disappointing. You can't even begin to think how awful it's going to make you look at home, at the movies, or on the big screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the film on video, and it's about an hour long and two hours on DVD, and I'd like to compare the two.  The video was in black and white, while the movie was color, which just makes me want to see the movie again, but it never came. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was given the DVD of the first movie, it was really interesting, with some good special effects. I don't believe it had been released in any kind of way in the US before. I feel compelled to make a statement about the DVD, that is the reason I went and rented this one. I'll also admit that this is probably going to be a little more accessible to me than the previous movies. My guess is that the original DVDs sold in their day were much more accessible than the first feature. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not sure that anyone in the cast, myself included, is going to take the whole thing in stride.  I think the director himself may have been the one to have the idea of the whole project. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading an essay about "Why don't other people make movies", I'm not sure what they were expecting. I don't like the idea of using films as propaganda, or of pretending that this film is part of any Hollywood film series, I'd rather see this in a cinema and I hope that this is possible. The only positive review in here is about "The Woman Behind the Man", because that film had a similar theme. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was fun to have an interesting discussion about all the science behind the film. For instance, when I was an intern with the National Science Foundation, I did research for a film called "The Invisible Visitor" about how the invisible visitor could be found. I was very interested in that film and that is something that most people who have seen "Silent Running" have been able to see and appreciate. That is why I have watched it.  This is a very dry piece, I have been a fan of science fiction since the mid 1950's and this is a good hour and half for those two hours or so. I found it absolutely awful. If you want to watch it again, I say go to "Silental Running" which has it all, just as it's about 10 years old.  The film is about 10 minutes long when they claim that it's the longest, and they show you a clip of this film in the end credits.   The acting, the story, the whole concept, the concept is an absolute disgrace and it just makes you want not to watch another minute. This film isn't worth one minute of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie was a comedy about a bunch of guys with a sense of humor who had a great sense of their own humor.  So, I guess this is a comedy. I had a sense that this would be a comedy film made to keep things short. It's about an hour and twenty minutes long, and the first movie I watched was about forty minutes long. It was a bit of a tongue in cheek, low budget, film about a very serious matter. The second movie is an action film about an action. The only thing missing is a big fat action scene in there somewhere, and I think we're going to get it.  This movie is much, much longer than I had originally anticipated. It starts right where the first film ends (at the very end) and gets right into the second. It has some really bad people (I guess they didn't make the first one very good) that I'm about to call the "B" team. The film is a lot of things, a lot like "B". It's hard to concentrate because it is so hard to get your mind focused. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the most popular films, "The Ten Commandments", this film was made in the 60's, so that's why it's called "The Twelve".  The best-known part of this film is the part where the Ten Commanders are set free, after being confined for 2,000 years, when the prophet Elijah leads the army of prophets, the Ten Tribes are supposed to be marching and preaching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that some of the other reviewers have called this a comedy. This movie is about a lot of heavy stuff, the characters are dumb and don't learn. It's so bad, you can't even make fun of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a bit dated.  It has "Pulp Fiction"-esque scenes, which is why it was released on DVD.  The film is not just for people who have read the novel. It is actually a pretty bad movie.   I would recommend anyone who wanted to see this movie to avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, the "Americanization" of the Japanese people is not only bad, but is offensive to the Japanese race and culture. This is one of the reasons why so many Japanese are unhappy with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching a movie called "Beverly Hills Cop" or something. It was a spoof of Beverly Hills cop movies, i mean, you're not going to see any real Beverly Hills Cop here.  In terms of acting alone, i think the only thing that makes it worthwhile is the "tough guy" thing. There are some very funny things that can be had with that. I'll say that the way you go through the "beverly hills cop" part, if you were to be a cop, would you just shoot in to a building.  If you see this movie for your education, you'll get the "film" that comes out at the end of the year, which is a "b" rated, which should be funny.  I found it "overacted", very "over" dramatic, very over the top, and the whole idea of this movie was about an urban gangster.  This isn't really a gangster movie at all, and most certainly not like "Broken Arrow", "Bad Boys", or "White Dog". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had an absolutely great cast of well known and well loved actors who was looking to make this a film that was to be made for the rest of their lives.butbutbut because this was one film, it was very late to be able to complete the final edit on this movie, meaning the final product will be just as awful as this movie is for all. I did enjoy the idea of the movie and wanted to keep watching this after the initial shock at seeing the end product of this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As was suggested by a previous reviewer, this was the first feature in the series. As I read the other reviews, I thought it was a comedy. Or, perhaps it was just a silly film about something stupid. So I watched it (after hearing other reviewers comment it). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of the late, great actor Christopher Reeve (who played Superman, and played many other characters) who played Superman in Man of Steel. (I also happen to be a big fan of DC Comics).  Reeve did not play Superman like he played Superman from the 1940's to the 1950's, which is the primary reason why people think that he is somehow "retiring", because Reeve and I were the same Superman in the 1940s, then in the 1950s and 1960s. I have spoken to Reeve about this, he has said that he has seen some movies since then, that would be the closest thing to "retirement", because Superman from Superman Returns, and Superman from Smallville, were two movies that were released after his death.  I will leave you with another movie, Superman: The Movie Man, which was released in 1970, and had no relation to this movie.  If you like to see Reeve as Superman, you would know it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that the director would be able to help with this. This is the only movie that I really have watched since my divorce from my ex husband, and it's just my husband and me.  It's only the next day that he'll be able join the church with the rest of the family in the morning. I'm sad to say that I have seen some of the other movies I'll watch in the future, and they're pretty good and they really have shown some of God's glory in these moviesbut this movie is very sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the movie for the first time on HBO, with my fellow viewers, and I'd love to get into the details of exactly what was in those original 90 minutes, and why it was that it didn't come out on HBO. Also, the plot, it's a mystery. This is not a movie I want to spend more time watching, not least because I'd like to get back the time and effort put into a movie that was made before 2001, or at least that was a successful movie. A good analogy is "Kurt Cobain". If you liked the Kurt Cobain movie, or "Nevermind", this is a movie like any other. But that means no special awards. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was released in 1997, and the actors were not the sharpest of the pack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It wasn't made for children, and it's not like a "kid movie" or "child movie". The main "child" figure in this movie is the guy with the red shirt who is holding a little "baby-carrier".  So, if you are into making movies with little kids, the story is for you.  But, as for the story and the movie itself, they were "good" enough for their "children's film".  If you liked "The Black Cat" (the 1940 version), you could see how the characters were "touched" in that film, and some of them were "blessed" by a studio to be able to do that. It just happened that "The Cat" was very short.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've ever been to California, you'll know the place is one huge and sprawling area. I think it would have been better to do this movie during the daytime on some of the other islands in the archipelago, or at least to give the audience a better idea of where they were going when they made this movie. Maybe then they would have known how to make the journey in a more efficient fashion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about an art restoration crew, which means that it is about restoring things that were destroyed.  That's what they're dealing with. In an art world, you have to go through the same process again and again and make sure your work is not contaminated in any way. This is what I'm dealing with as I watch the film. I do find that in certain situations the film looks like it's shot on a low budget, that means I do have a "director's" camera to work with as they were being restored (I know that it's an old camera, it was new on set in France), but it was shot for the rest of the film with the same camera and lens.  The story is a little weak in the middle with a bit of character development. I think it would have been better if there had been a bit more of the movie about "how did this happen", where these men meet up with the women and get to know each other, to see some sort of interaction between them in the next few years.  I think that was something that was happening during the shoot (the "lost years") and it's still happening in the "lost city".  I also think the story's time in the time capsule is a bit short.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it was released in 1968 it was hailed as a comedy that would keep people laughing. The very first movie was directed by Otto Preminger and was released with a large amount of publicity from his previous work.    Preming's film was about an "American family man" in the beginning and the second one was a comedy about a French family man. The third was about a Canadian family man and the fourth was a British family man... all four films were based on the same character. And this is not a "serious" film, or even "romantic" film. There are no real surprises in the film. It's basically an odd movie which is about an odd man who's trying to be loved by a girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about a serial killer, and I think that should give you pause before watching it. I can't believe that I've been in one of the serial killer movies for the last six years that I'm involved in it's quality or that I even want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie a couple of days ago, and the first couple of years, and all I did was laugh with other friends and laugh at the jokes of other friends. I knew it was coming out, and I had the option of watching this film the same way as most movies. That was not going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film will most likely make you the greatest film maker out there. But you'll probably have to have at least 5-10 years in this kind of work (I've made 30-50 short films in my time) to become a bona fide film director. I really wish this film didn't turn out to be so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can say that I watched it, it's just been released. The DVD came with this movie and i was really intrigued by the idea of a cult film. I'd just like to point out that there are people out there who really like cult films.  If you're one of them, and really have an affinity with them. I would like to say that most people know what cult films are about. I just happen to be in the "curious crowd". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had great potential, especially with the lead actor, and the great actor, Joe Pesci, who was a perfect match for Pesci's character. "The Man With The Golden Arm" was the first movie, and Pesci and I had a great chemistry. The movie "The Perfect Match" is the result of a collaboration between the two people but, after the first few scenes, it just feels like the two are in different worlds, the scenes are shot and edited and are shot in the same location, the actors have to constantly switch places and work for it. There are some great scenes in the film, most notably in Pesci as the police officer on the street and in the police department with his partner and his partner's friend and then as the doctor with the two female nurses. The great soundtrack ofbut isbutchered. It is too much like it was shot in this movie and it looks as if the director had an assistant make some of these scenes up. It feels like all the action is going from the point of view of Pesci. There is no continuity and the movie is so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just finished watching it in the theater (which is just an hour and a half, I have to say), and so I can only assume I was the only one to see it, so don't really assume that I know all of the answers about this piece of cinema.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie was really not even about the guy, just because they put a bunch of guys in it. I think the whole movie really is about a girl who falls in love with a guy.  It's pretty awful, all the way around. The girl isn't even hot, it's hot as hell for most of the movie, even with the fake boobs. In real life, if you saw her, she would be a super model, just for fun. She had so much potential for this movie, it was great, and it was a nice, romantic comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of similarities between the two films.  It is interesting to compare and contrast the film.   I have also seen the director's interview with the writer who was still on the island (on the "Finding Nemo" DVD) and interviewed him about this film. The writer didn't seem to be in his prime in the "Nemo" film. And the writer's character, "Joe" is a teenager with no real understanding of adult issues. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the sequel to "The Omen" (1997), which was a cult film. It is also a sequel to a film from the same company "The Exorcist" (1982), which means that it is a horror-fantasy flick, or a supernatural horror film. This film has many people who claim that they know something that the film does not have, that they have seen something from the future, or that they can psychically read the future (which has occurred with "The Devil Seed," another movie from the "Exorcist"-series, and which was also made by the same group). The main character is played by Robert Englund, who has already been to hell and back in the "Omen" series, and he is the son of a famous Swedish vampire hunter, which has been in two films in the past, "The Vampire Hunter" (1996) and "The Vampyre Hunter," and he has a brother, played by Peter Falk, who is the older son of his older brother.  This "The Vanishing" is a very odd film. If you have ever seen the original "The EXORCIST," you may have been familiar with the film's plot, which concerns the story of an English priest who travels to Italy to track down a killer who kills people for his sake.  The film starts out with a flashback of a young boy (Peter Falk) and his mother, and later the priest (Robert Englund) travels to Germany, Spain, England, and France.  Englund's character is now a college student (studying in Stockholm) who lives in Sweden and wants to get a good job, and then wants to join the university and be a priest, while Falk's character has become an English-speaking priest. They travel to France, Italy, Sweden, and England, where Falk has already gone to England, after seeing a German version of "The Demonologist."   Englund's character looks a bit like Peter Falk from "The Deadly Vampiric," and some of his hair is red and blue, while Peter Falk's looks a little bit like the original film's priest (the only difference being the beard). The film was shot on location in London, Germany, and Italy. The film-making team has been criticized for the fact that they didn't follow a consistent plan with the plot and the final result, because it is supposed to show that a German film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do like a great deal of the acting that it was because I believe it was one of the best-written films of the 1930's.  It is, after all, a very famous film that is very, very good and not just a few lines from it's credits (like, say, the credits for this film). I don't think that the people who made this film would have made a sequel to a very successful movie (such as The Wizard of Oz) like they did (I hope they would have the guts to try to get that done). I would love to be a part of the process of this movie's making as it was once, and I'm hoping that they give me a chance to see it in the near future. If the two leads were in my head when this movie was made, they would be the most successful directors working in the world, I'd want to work with them (and I don that they can work for lack of that). So my hopes are very high that they would actually take the time to get to work on something and to do what I think is best. The first time around they made a movie about a very popular hit movie, and that is what I believe that they were working with) and they made the decision that it's about being about making another big hit for the studio and that's what they did; this time it would be for my sake and that of the characters in the story, but not for their own selfish reasons (they didn't, and for sure didn't) and that was what would keep this movie from becoming something that was like the sequel to Wizard of OZ, the one about the Tin Woodman, The Man in the Iron Mask and The Wizard's Revenge. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was 13, I would have to say I loved the Disney Channel's original series. I would love to see my favorite characters in their classic show.  I saw this when I was 14. My dad paid for it and I think it cost me something like 10 bucks to rent. That alone doesn't cost a lot. As I sit here and wonder how the hell this is going to end, I have a hard time watching a movie that tries to be so innocent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen many films of this director before and all of them were comedies that were directed to make you laugh. "Poke" is a non-tootoo movie. The voice is also the same for the characters. The only difference between this movie and other non-pokemon-related films is that Pokemon Go (the augmented reality game) has "faster moving" characters. This movie is one of those cartoons that is made for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only positive review is that it was in black & white.  The fact that the black & blue version is at least a half-way decent movie in terms of acting is a very sad episode for both the actors and the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of my friends said I was a really smart person, so I didn't see how they could think I was stupid enough to rent this piece of crap. I would not recommend this piece to anyone who is not at a real mental state that they are even watching. I am just a regular old person who is a fan of The X Files.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about the same thing over and over again.  There was no character development and very little originality.  The story is pretty much what it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a hard time watching movies when it's so late and then I just turn the TV off.  I give this movie a 3 because at the very least it was good that I had seen it earlier on V and maybe other people had seen the film and had gotten a review from me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I could get away with it and that it would be my first movie (so to speak) and then, just like any of the other movie-going members of this website (including myself) would do, I went out and bought this film in Canada (which I am supposed to enjoy) and it's just me, because I'm Canadian. I don't understand why, other than wanting to avoid the "hurt feelings" that you get in the theater when you're trying to find your own family, that Canadian theaters put this on the same day as this, when there is no real reason for it to be here. I'm also very disappointed by the movie because I feel that it's not just a piece of "films" with a beginning and an end, but more of a piece that is meant to be a movie about something that actually happened. This film is a movie in the mold of a Hollywood "film" that takes place in the town of "Aunt Millie" with some of the most popular celebrities. It's just made up of three days of footage, which has no real connection to the people of Little River, which is why it feels like a "film". You're treated to a "witty" view of your "heroes", as well as some of your favorite "movie stars" like the three girls, and some of them actually speak some sort of English with some very annoying "imitation" accents. When a character you really care about (like a girl you know or a character like a real person) is on the screen, you'll actually get to hear their voice, and that's the case with the three women in the film. There's a girl in a movie who has a very British accent in the first 10 minutes of the movie. I haven't even touched the girls in the movie; this girl has a British accent. You'll learn very quickly that Little River isn't just some fictional little town; it's a real place that is full of real people with real problems, and it feels so fake. You don't get to get a sense of your main character and your town as a whole, at all.  I'm not trying to make the movie "funny" or "artsy" because of all of the negative reviews I'm hearing right now, I'm hoping you have a sense for the film's purpose and if it is, that it should be seen by other people.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been interested in this film for a very long time. The problem is that the majority of the cast.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be the sequel of "The Monster Squad", and if you look at the cover, you'd assume this would be a movie in which Monster Squad (the title) would appear again (as in the original monster movie, starring Mike Myers). There is one scene in this movie that has the Monster Squad and one scene of Monster Squad.  They do a great job in but they are not perfect. In one scene, the Monster's face is not completely white and there is a little bit of hair on his forehead which was part of the design for this film. If you're wondering why there is only one shot of it in the movie, I'm not saying it's not there or the Monster doesn't have one in the picture, he's got an eyebrow that's not fully white, like Mike Myers did in "The Monsters" (who was a white guy).  As a monster lover, Mike Myers is completely white (which he was in "Monster House"). There are two scenes with Monster Squad in this film and Mike Myers does not have an eye patch and Monster Squad has an eye that is completely blacked out.  I'm sure that's an oversight on the part of someone from the production company.  This film contains a number of monsters that I don't even remember.  You'd think that this is just a bunch of monsters from the newsstand of a movie shop and you'd be wrong.  One more time. It's like a "Cinemax" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this was the last film that I saw, because I was watching "The House," the TV version of "The Price." I'm not sure what the price is now, but this is probably the last "price" movie. This is an independent film that has no major Hollywood distributor. This was released in January, and just a month after "House" has been released in theaters. I saw this movie in a very small theatre, in a movie theater near San Francisco. I can only imagine what it is like to see "House," and to hear some of the comments that were made about that movie, after seeing this "The Road." It would be really interesting to see how the films compare visually, and then compare their story lines, and how well the actors were in their roles, but I couldn't find anything that made this movie worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In some ways, it's a comedy, as it was in the original. In other ways, you're stuck in the middle of a movie that makes no sense at all, it never did so I am extremely disappointed in the movie and I was really hoping this would be a comedy. It's been done, I believe, so don't get me wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen more movies. This movie is more of a cult.  If you're not a Christian who believes in a loving God you should not spend time watching this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad to say that at least the "G" films were the big, dumb, gross, violent, disgusting, and blood and guts types of films.  The "B" films are like the first film, with some gore that's not so bad, it is just not as graphic or "gross" as the first "B". This is, I think, due to the fact that I only saw the first B, and some of the "B"-types of films tend to feature "G"-type actors. I suppose the film was directed to try and appeal to the "C"-types, and the "J" films, the same as other "B-type" films. There's one film (the one you're renting) that you can rent that is "G", and the other is "D" type, or "D"-type. You can also rent "D", which would be "C-type". And what a "D-type", which was kind of "G-type'ed", which is kind of like a "B-"type film, like "A" films). I guess they've gone all out and made a real "D". I'm not one to be overly judgmental, and I'm sure they're trying to appeal to a different type of viewer. Anyway, they are going to be the type of films that are really "J-type," which is, for a lot of Americans, "Hollywood" films starring white guys, the kind that are made by studios in Hollywood. The kind that deal with, well, the big budget, mainstream "Hollyweed" Hollywood films. A "C" type of film, which, by and large, deals with indie films that deal mostly with real "Cinema Verite" stuff, would be the sort that deals with, "Independent films," because those films are so much more "real" (in the sense of the word, not to be used in the same way as "reality" here). So, the "D type" films would be really, really bad for a couple of reasons, namely: A. They were probably made by somebody who didn't know anything about the "H" films (the kind that make these types of types of pictures). They didn't see "Crazy Movie", because it is really hard to make a film like that without some knowledge of the subject matter. I guess you'd have to go
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My rating for this movie is "1 out of 10" I haven't been to my local video store and I don't know if I'll get a second chance at this video so I'm not sure if they have a second, or if the DVD is out.  My review on the video is, "watch" by the way, not a review of the video. It's an analysis of the movie, because the movie was so horrible and so unbelievable. I am sure I could find other people's comments that are as horrible as mine. I was very upset and I had to go to the bathroom and vomit, and then came to the very last scene where I was praying for God to deliver me. It was really so painful and awful. It had nothing to recommend it for any film, ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad. It's really bad. The script, the directing, the sound, the direction is bad.   I'm not sure if the director didn't have something to do that night but after viewing this film, I'm really really hoping that you guys were asleep. I thought that it was supposed to be some good satire/commentary on movies like this (which I know it's supposed to do), I'm trying to look at this in some kind of satirical manner. I feel like I'm watching the first 20 minutes of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't judge this film by its premise alone.  It seems that all actors, save for one or two who were in the original film, decided to star in a film of their own. So it's interesting to hear from the two or three actors who are still playing in the "The Shop" (1933) and "The Blue Shop" movies that have been re-edited in black and white that they are still involved in those movies.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must be the only person in the world that was not invited into the screening of this. The film has already been released on DVD, which I own. This is not good for the movie, in that the opening scenes and the end are already really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like many of the actors who appear in this movie, and the story has one of the more noble intentions, that is to try to help a group of people who are in need. I love seeing a movie where good things happen and people do good things, and a movie with a great cast of actors but, alas, I've been watching this movie for a few days now, and so far I feel like this story could have used more depth and more of an attempt at characterization.

I don't know why, and this is probably because I don. I'm not so sure that my friends, who are filmmakers, have experienced the film in its native country, and thus don't have an idea about the situation and the film. The director obviously doesn't know anything about it, or else he would have known that in his last movie "Cri" (the "Crouching Cyclops" film) about this kind of situation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with our two leads--the main characters. Then the movie cuts to a lot of scenes that were just as pointless as the movie itself. I think that if you don't have some kind of a plan you should just avoid this film. It is a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been a while since I got involved with the movie. We've been friends for about a half an hour. I'm not a big 'how long is the movie' guy, so it's only fair that I just go ahead and say that the movie will be released this month, I believe it's a Christmas movie. My parents and I have been through Christmas movies (we don't know if you've seen them all), and so are the friends of the friends, so I think we can all have confidence in that.  What I would like is for you guys to review the movie for you, because it is really important that it's reviewed by a positive review. I haven't been able to find anything that is bad about the movie,but but I guess it would be nice. This movie is basically a love song with butbutbutbutchered lyrics. In the movie we are in the city of San Francisco, and the city is going through some changes, and it's been going through a lot of hard times over the last few years. As a result, the mayor and the public at large are just about as clueless as the other characters in the movie when it comes to matters of political corruption and business practices. We are told that "the system" works in a manner similar to the way it did back in the day when the city was a lot more corrupt. In truth, the movie is so badly written by so many talented writers. It's embarrassing, it's bad, it doesn't have real characters, it is so obviously written in advance by the film industry, and is just bad from the start.  This movie will turn out to be a cult film, because the end result is going to be the same.  It is not a film for kids, and for those people who watch it, I suggest you don't get sucked into it. It is awful.

And let's not forget that some of these men did become best friends in real life, in the sense of that brother's brother's relationship or brother's sister's relationship... they were in very real trouble, in very severe financial difficulties. I have seen some of them in the past, when they had to sell their houses, and I think some of the brothers had to find jobs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found that the movie had its first 15 minutes, a sort of romantic comedy, in the late 70's.  This movie, is about an 18 years old guy and a 20 years old girl, and they both go on dates (with one guy, not another guy) and the guy's girlfriend, so that's it for rom-coms and the other movies out there. What other films have happened to the couple in their teens? I find this film's romance (or lack thereof) to be embarrassing and lame. This was a pathetic attempt at a love story, not even close to good. The movie makes me want to vomit, and I found myself turning to the TV, and thinking about it all night.  The story is pathetic, and so is the cast. The love between the two leads is completely contrived, which leads the movie to be a joke. The ending is so ridiculous, so contrived that it makes me feel like I've wasted my life and money, or if that's even possible.  I'm willing to take one look at this film, to see if that improves the movie even slightly, and trust me, you'll be back to me again and give me a refund on that stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off like a very good, sweet comedy. It starts with my wife, my brother and my brother-in-law and I'm sure that we all got to go through an interminable drive from Santa Rosa to the movie theater to watch this movie with the other actors and my best guess would be it was a good comedy, a very "witty" comedy from all of us. As it turns out there are many reasons for this film's failure. First of all there is a very poor cast, and in some cases the actors were pretty good. I think there are some pretty great actors out there and have some good, well-developed characters in my opinion. I'm very proud of the actors and they should be recognized for their efforts. This is not a movie with good actors.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the actors has his real name in it and I can't figure out if he had to change it or if it's really supposed to be this guy who's name I find out from IMDb.  It's really the other guy. If they have the decency of doing it in front of a live audience they should just do it live on the stage.  The first time I saw it, I saw an hour and fifteen minute trailer and was really interested in it, that is because I'm really into the kind of film they had made. It had all kinds of interesting characters and had gone to the trouble of finding some of the original cast members to work with.  There's nothing original about it. I don't think it was worth $8 bucks, at least not to me. I had to sit through the two hours of my life to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do not believe the movie was written to be released theatrically.

I know it wasn't a horror film in the traditional sense of the word (because of it's budget, I think it's safe to say it wasn) because I think a lot of people know the concept of a film that was supposed to be "a horror film" that I think everyone involved had the same idea, to make an interesting movie.butbutbutbecause of the lack of a script, directing, script direction, direction (the actors), it wasn. A terrible film and I felt guilty for sitting through this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really a documentary about people who went out in search of Bigfoot. The actual film is only about 3 hours long, and they try to make it longer with their two other "documentary" segments. The documentary is supposed to be about the true story of the lives of the people who supposedly went out on a quest to find Bigfoot.  I don't think they have made it very clear to people that they are trying to make a movie about the lives and the deaths of people who actually made their lives and their deaths through these people's deaths and suffering, because they don't do anything to give an objective evaluation of the true motivations of those people. I found it to be a sad and uninspiring film that is really about a bunch of people's imaginations and the search for Bigfoot. I really don't know how to feel about my time wasting my time at this movie, and I have a feeling they might be making another one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What do you do now? I wish I could give this film to my daughter, or daughter of my son-in-law because my children do not watch television, so that's the only way to watch this movie. As for the rest of the family, they just saw the movie last night, and they are already familiar with the characters in the movie, which is not something that you really want to do. The movie was probably a little bit slow in the beginning, and it could be a little difficult to find the actors to be a bit more realistic in some of the roles. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really was looking forward to seeing my favorite British director, Richard Attenborough. He was my favorite and he would have been the main character in my favorite movie "Richard Attenbrough's War". I remember Richard Attensborough having a part in the film "RACE TO THE SUN" which would have followed this movie's release in 1988.  I had read an interview with Richard Attenhould in the previous issue about the production of this film and how he had made a film with my favorite actor, John McIntire, and I had heard of the movie being done in the UK. The story of this movie was all the wrong direction. The British actors would be on the left side.   John McIntyre is right handed. Richard Attencould is left handed. The actors don't talk to each other. This is a very amateur piece of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy and the film would be a perfect example of that film - as the movie opens, we're looking at the same location - which is pretty sad considering the good things we had in mind with the original films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is supposed to be a documentary about the film, so I thought maybe it would at least shed some light on the subject matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw it in theaters when it was called "The Incredible Journey," or similar films. It was really the Incredible Journey for one. The movie starts out with the good guy who is on a mountain rescue team, and he is very much in his element. There is a really good and good story there, but but there was a little too much, because they didn't do a very good job with the soundtrack, and they did another good job on the sound track, but the music just came across as not great. And, what do you do when your movie is in a theater? It was very cold in this theater, and the camera didn't even pan out on the other side of the movie, and it's cold in most of the world. In the end, the movie was shot in New York, and that was a very cold and rainy day, and if the film had been shot in the Philippines, then it would have been a bit more accurate. I think this is because of some other elements of the story. The film was shot at night, which makes sense given how the story was written. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a very long-winded guy. I'm also gay and am very fond of my own partner. I have the most intimate knowledge of my partner, and this is the first movie in a long, long time where I actually felt that the sex was going anywhere at all.  I know the director is a big boy, and I don't believe that the director will change the ending of the movie when this is a topic of discussion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd been to several films about these guys doing the film - they have been involved in many movies before. One of them was a documentary about a film with me. In the end, this was one of those films where they showed the best of the actors - some good and some good actors.but, if they can just stay away from the kind of comedy that they did in their first movie, there won't be many surprises.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is called the story of my friend and has been played and shown a million times before. This is the story I told to the director andbutbutbutBUTbutbut but he had a lot of fun with the kids butbutbutbecause of the age difference, it took the actors almost a decade to get used to the situation of having to act with a grown man.  I think it was very disappointing to watch this, a very lame film, and the movie is really so bad. I wish I could make it into a comedy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To begin, I am sure that the film will show people how to escape this place, but I think the people who are making this film are actually very naive and should be avoided. The "documentary" was pretty good because it was based on the actual facts of the war. It's the movie that's about to be released on VHS. The reality is that there is no real "documentarian" on this one. The people who made this film didn't even have a clue what to make of it, and it's an embarrassment to say the least. And they seem to be making it for entertainment value. The only good thing is that they're trying to get this in the big cities where there are people who want to see it. In the end of the day, if you ever get a chance to see this on VCR, just watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens with a young woman named Michelle, who is living alone in a remote location in the U. She is the love interest of the movie, and she is in love with the main character,butbutbutthen he gets caught up with the girls in high school,and she has to go through high school and college...like me! Michelle doesn't know any more than the average high school girl about the entire world, including a lot of the women in the world. She's seen a lot more than I have, and there's a whole lot of stuff that Michelle hasn't seen, and probably never will see...and that makes the movie even more confusing. The only time I actually sat down and read a lot about it was during the first viewing when it was released, and I think it's fairly good that I knew a fair amount about the world, so I knew about all the places in the movie. I don't know if anyone else has seen it before.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing that comes to mind is that this film was made at the beginning of our civilization.  I mean it was still a primitive film made on old technology and you could see some prehistoric looking animals and it was made in the desert region of New Mexico. It was made for the viewing pleasure of the people in that area. The second thing I thought about was that it was shot on location. This time around, it seems like a whole new film was released. I know that there were a lot of people involved in making this film, so I am assuming that they were all paid fairly and that they just made the film without any money, as opposed to a lot less film like most Hollywood films. It's the type of film you would pay for when you go to the video store and rent.  Of course the production budget is the same as before.  It's just that it looks like the first one. I don't know, I could be wrong. I haven't seen the entire thing and I'm just speculating from the looks of it. Anyway, I just thought this film looked really bad from the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for this movie, on the TV in my apartment, for the second time. I was hoping for a great movie with a great cast and director. I don't know why people really liked this movie. It doesn't really fit into the "twist" of a great twist or something like that. I also just plain plain didn't find it worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a comedy and should be compared to a horror movie, or at least be classified in that genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think that this was going to be a movie that was for kids and that it would be made in the 60's. I just had the movie in the theater. I didn. It was made in 1995.  If this movie was made by an old lady, it's because she wasn't old enough to vote, and she should have been voted into office. There was a woman who worked for the company that made this movie, she got the job, because she was an old person who made the movie, because the company made a very old movie, that's how they made it, and the movie was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director's best friend and closest collaborator (Michael Cimino) was a part of the original "Ghosts" series; when they were in the series' production and marketing. He must have been a major influence on the original, which was about a very similar premise, one of the leading characters and their quest for revenge.  After a long and long and painful process, the movie is an amalgam of the worst movies from the worst era of cinema-making, not a fun-to-watch product that I'm proud to be a part-owner of. The film starts out as a rather slow-moving, introspective film about Michael Ciminino and his role in making the original films, and slowly escalates into a complete bore. The character who plays the main antagonist is one of those'super-heroes' that are the reason why I was interested in the movie; a great and powerful character, whose motivation is at its purest, is being played by a character that sounds like he's being forced to be this film's hero, and to be honest, it's not fun. And I'm not even talking about the fact that there's a total lack of great comedic moments or good lines (I think that's a different kind of film). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is trying to make me think the same movie I saw when I saw it in '70. This is a very depressing movie.  It is not funny and doesn't make you laugh. It just makes you want to cry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with a really good message about how much we love our country and how great the American army is, so I feel bad for the soldiers who have to watch this movie. The message is clear. If you are a military personnel, there is a message that if you are found in violation of the law, then the American people will punish you. That is what it should have been all along.

If you're going to see this movie, you're basically getting a DVD of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the movie was supposed to be about this. The first three movies had very few people in the world. I mean, I think of a few hundred people in a couple of those movies. This movie had about 10 people in it at one point, and it seemed to be the only movie I saw on television.   The movie, like I said, is not the most exciting, not at all, and the way it all plays out (especially, the end) is terribly dull and unbelievably stupid. It's just about as entertaining to look at as a really really crappy movie. It didn't get me up. My wife and I couldn't take it, it didn't entertain me. The only thing it did was make me laugh. The fact that this was supposed be a "serious" film is ludicrous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really the only film that I found on DVD or rented. If I am a director, I would probably be really desperate for other work. The fact that I had a film like "I can't stop watching" makes this look like the first movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is one of those 'Hollywood" movies. Not one person can figure out the basic concept behind this movie. And the only thing that's worth saying is the 'Cannons' in this movie that have 'Guns' in it.   There are two possible solutions to this mess. This film just might be a sequel to the film that the original director made. It is hard to believe that the makers of this film were not aware of the subject matter. If you haven't read the book, it's pretty much a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why I am reviewing this is because I have always been curious and I have come across some of the more obscure movies. The movie begins on the side of the street in a black-and-white-striped costume, wearing a black hat and white shirt, and then proceeds to take a tour of the movie. I really wanted to see the movie, but that is a good reason to take the tour. The scene that takes place in the subway car is the scene I saw in "Batman Forever" and was the reason why many people rated that movie as being better than "Dark Knight" or "Batman Returns," which was for its ability to depict what happens in that subway car scene. That was the scene in the movie "Batman and Robin," which depicts the aftermath of the escape of the Joker's henchman, the Joker himself, for example, and this was the same one. I'm going to put it bluntly: "The Batmobile is the Batmobile." The Batmobile on "Nightwing" was black, while it is in the "Batman" film blacked out, as was the Batcycle in "The Batman" films. The Batcar on "Detective Comics" is red, while the Batcar in "Detractors" is yellow. The car on the movie screen is red in the original series, while in the comics it is black. If you want to see a Batmobile, you'll have to get your hands on a black and white one, or an episode of "Super Friends," or the animated "Batman: Batmobile" cartoon. There are some scenes that are shot of an actual Batmobile in the theater, and they don't get shot off at the scene. The original Batmobile appeared in "Superfriends," for example. That's a white and blue Batmobile. The one in "Night of the Monster Men" is painted red, yellow, and green. I guess the filmmakers just thought that if you see a car, it will look like a Bat, and the same thing happened in the production. That would explain why the Bat-mobile was yellow instead of blue.   Also, there's the Batwing, which appears in the final scene, in the Batcopter, and is a red Batwing that the movie is using as it's version of the Batplane. It would have been nice if they used the red Batcopters in "Knightfall," "Detector" or
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have ever seen by Robert Altman, who had just directed this movie, and since he did not write the screenplay it was decided it was best to use Altman's name. It was supposed to be a comedy, a romantic comedy, with Altman in the lead role as Altman as the producer.  And Altman was the last one who had been in Hollywood when Altman made his last movie. The Altman character is the most annoying character in the movie. It's not funny at all. Altman is extremely vain. And since Altman has no sense of humor or intelligence it's only safe to say he doesn't have the mental capacity to be funny, or that's the best compliment I can give him for his work on this film. He had very low self esteem when he made his first movie, or in fact his acting in that movie in "Buckaroo Bonanza" that Altman would be credited with in some of his interviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a bad-movie. I'm not sure how it happened. If I'm ever in the mood to watch a remake, I'd be willing to take a chance on this film. I'd like to see a guy (myself, of course) do what he's supposed to do, and try to recapture that feel and spirit of the original film. And I'm hoping that this new director will be better than this version. The first thing I want is a simple script that allows for my character, an alcoholic, to really be able to express myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a very bad movie. The first scene of the film was extremely interesting.  Maybe it was supposed to be a shock film.  There were very few scenes with the camera on the subject.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, along with "Mysterion" series, has a story that has been done a thousand times. It is the same for other movies and that's the problem. There are no new ideas in the film and that is what really keeps it from being worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main villain, who is also the main protagonist, is a pretty good actor, and in his role of the main villain he was probably the biggest star in the whole "The Ring" franchise. He was a pretty big star in this movie, he just didn't take the lead role in the film, and it was pretty obvious from the start, that the movie was shot in a rural locale and the local inhabitants were going to see it as a romantic comedy with a pretty pretty girl. That is not the place to go with this movie. I would say that the character was basically a girl, who was very pretty and had to wear some very pretty clothes and act very girlish, who ended up looking like a super hero instead of like, "Super Woman". You can say that she was in her Super Hero costume, which is the movie's version of Super Hero, which she was actually wearing when the film was released, as she was the first superhero on screen in this role, so she had to look sexy for the movie. You could easily make out her breasts and I think that that would have made her look sexy as well, if she was wearing a more modest outfit. The fact that she went to the mall in the same type of outfit that she did as a superhero is just ridiculous, and then she tried to act like a guy in this film, or some other version of the movie, which would be very stupid, in my opinion. She's too beautiful for this role. She had an excellent body for a super model, and her body wasn't ruined by this film either. I guess what I would like to say about her was that she looked very nice when she was a super heroine, and when she met with her "boyfriend", who was in his Super Hero outfit, her breasts got even larger and that is probably why she was having this very modest role in this one.   This movie was pretty terrible, for a movie about a girl who was super-heroic and super beautiful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie yesterday, and it wasn't a very well made movie, it didn't give me any joy whatsoever, not one bit, to be honest.

I saw it because I wanted to see what this movie was like, and I didn't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you see this movie, the only thing that you really see is the movie itself.  The "movie" is an overlong mess that has no purpose. I am truly amazed that the director of this film got the opportunity to make a film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this book when it was in print and it was supposed to give me some insight into the mind of the person on the other side, which might give you some idea of how the brain works, I was in it's very narrow circle, and my curiosity is to find out whether this is an adult who is a child that's supposed to be talking to me or not, whether he has some kind of brain damage from the stroke or is a "child" who needs help, which leads me to write an angry review about this movie, because it's not an adult or child. It's only an adult. And that makes it all the more odd to see him with me at the very end, and what he had done with me in the hospital and what we were supposed to get through a series of several other times. He did, in fact, give me a "brain child" talk about my "mind." My hospital psychologist had to tell me to be patient and accept that he might be able to do it again someday, and I didn't know what that might look like. I don't think it looks anything like a "boy".  And it was the very least funny movie I have ever seen, at the end, with no real connection, no real point, and very little redeeming value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find the movie to be a sort of comedy (i'm not sure exactly what the word is here), because I don't remember seeing "Dr. Seuss". That would be the word "humor" or something of that nature. I just find that Seuss would be an interesting character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of the movie (and the book) is dedicated to a man named Richard, a man who was in love with Diana. I believe the reason why the director thinks this is necessary is that he doesn't want the viewers to have their heart broken for Richard's wife, even though she was with Richard at the time. When Diana was killed, Richard was inconsolable for a long time.  The director's movie version of Richard is about Richard's grief over her death. This is not at all the way it's portrayed in the book, or the movie version is an entirely different movie. The film version doesn't even seem to be based on the book...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the film, I saw a character named Dr. Kildare, who is a retired neurosurgeon who was referred to a neurosurgery.  In this film, Dr. Haldane, Dr KildARE, and Dr. Robert Haldale were all listed as neurosurgeons, and I had no idea that they were. I was really surprised that they all had the same job title. One of the best things about a movie, is if there is an opportunity to go see it, is to be able to go to the movie's DVD-RADIOS to find out who is in it. It's not a problem to go and see the movie for free on TV (in fact, I've seen it twice in the past, and am planning on seeing it again). The other person may have just lost their nerve and decided to buy the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself, which is a pretty good piece of work, is about 30% of the movie being about the movie, what they chose to do was make the movie.

How is it possible for me to imagine how much I actually care for the film and what it might become. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie was great, it was funny and had a funny ending. There was the first movie that was about two brothers, with the first ending, when the brother and sister have a relationship and they become engaged and married.  The brother and I are not engaged, and, I don't know, there's no way for us to be engaged. The film keeps on talking about the brother, in terms of what happens to him, it's just about the sister, or the brother being engaged with another woman. I have never been in a relationship with a woman who was not sexually attractive, and it pains me to see a film that doesn't portray women in a positive light in any sense of the word, and I don. The last time I saw a film about a man killing his wife, I had a great time with that film, and the sister in it, with no expectation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, it has a lot of people (and I mean a LOT) who loved the original series. It doesn't hurt to have this type of show. This is like an adult version of the show from 1993, with the same producers and a lot more people (but a lot less money for a network to put it on). I don't know if they have gone the same route as they did in 1993, or if it's just some type of low budget. I'm a true fan of the original "Star Trek" show and I'm not one to look at the show in 1993 as if it were the newbie show for kids, just as I wasn't one to see the show as a kid. If I was a new fan to the show, I wouldn't want this show. As to why I say it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know this review has an agenda, and I do think this review is in some of the more important movies that don't fit into the "film of the month" category. I can only say that this film was made for me and for my family tobut it was not made for the rest of the world, and that's what you get in this film, not even close. It would be as though some movie from the 20's made out of the celluloid of today would not end up this bad... The film starts with an all-American family where one would be amazed. "Discovery" is a true and original documentary, but it is not an "independent" film. I'm a realist and not a real believer. I know that I'll get more insight into this in the film after watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is absolutely nothing in it. It just blows, that's all there is, so it was pretty dumb. If they had taken a bunch of us who went to the screening and asked us to do an acting class, I would have taken it seriously.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, let's start with the positives... there's plenty of good reviews. I love watching "The Sixth Sense" and the "Six" or whatever it was. I'm not sure what the director was thinking. I'll rate the movie as low 10/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors were supposed to be very experienced in their craft and this film was actually made in Canada (in Vancouver), in Toronto. That is not to say that they were poorly done or anything like that - they are very bad. They are extremely wooden and stiff and there is no real sense of what they are doing - even though they did make the same movie with a lot of talent in the past, they are simply doing the most basic of things and have no clue what they're doing. It is a real pity because there is a whole world of them waiting to be written about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the second movie.  This is not a movie for a small child. There were so many mistakes that the movie got lost somewhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very slow. Slow. I was curious how this movie would compare to other movies. A man came up to me while watching this movie and I said 'Why don't you come with a guy and tell me what this movie was about' He walked away, with the woman walking toward me. The woman walked away from me, and that man just walked off. She just walked toward him and asked for directions. She said 'This movie was for women, let me tell you.' I was very offended. He had the nerve to show me that he was a man, then show me a woman, then a man. You had to feel bad for the woman. There was no need to put that in your mind, I've never seen a good man come out of it, nor did I want to see it. You couldn't tell me any good movie in it. It's just a bad man with a bad woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It may seem like a bad film to you. This film was made with the intention of getting in the heads of the younger generations and showing them the consequences of their own actions. I'm sad to say that most of the film was taken from the TV station. And, even though I'm sure they have it on tape, the story is told from a young age, and, as a result, most of our young viewers would have seen this film for the TV show, if they had an interest in it, with the hope of some sort of catharsis. They might have liked it, and we can't fault them for that, especially considering the short amount of time our station had available to dedicate to the film, and then give this film to the TV stations, as this film is still available on VHS. We have had the pleasure of doing the PBS series on child-rearing for several years, and I think the PBS show is much better at giving a detailed analysis of the topic than this film, as well as addressing the problem of child neglect, which is certainly worth a look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really angry about this movie. Why was this made? I will give my thoughts on the movie in the meantime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been waiting to see it for some time. It's only because it came out on the Showtime network. I've never seen the movie in any format, so I can't compare it to any other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd say that I'm not really an "anti-comedy" or anything else.  I've actually been watching this film for at least 2 years on the Sci Fi channel and it doesn't seem like I was the only one who liked it, but if this were a big budget movie with the same "B" rating that is out of competition (not just "C") for the "D" category, it would have had some sort of "B+" rating, and since it is in the "B-," the only thing that I can really come up with is that the director made the same decision that he made in 2002, namely that "the world is about science" and, unfortunately, it was a different decision than I could have made when I had no money, no name and no influence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I didn't like was the movie didn't come with a trailer or it wasn't blacked out.  It's just an American movie that came from the U. There is no European (French or German or Italian) version of the movie.  The film is only available in video format, not DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never watched the show before, and I would expect to watch a show with a high cast of people who were interested in the show. The show was about an hour long, and after watching it, it was a pretty typical show that was nothing new. The writers wanted to really make it about "The Case Of The Family", or at least make us laugh, and while the show doesn't really have a "C", which is just the most basic of TV series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As an old lady, I've seen old films and I've been to the movies with an eye on old people, like, 'The Invisible Ray,' 'The Fly,' etc. And I can't imagine that the average person would want to see this movie.  I mean, how can they say they enjoyed the first movie. The first movie was about the boy with no voice, so people are not gonna change their opinion about how the boy changed. So I would recommend to watch it, if you really liked that movie, it would be a bit different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is probably the most honest one out of all the films made up till now,butbutbutBUTbutbutthe thing happened in the last 30 or so minutes or so in the town where I went and some kid ran off and it really didn't help anything in convincing the townspeople that the killer was still out there. I can't just take the kid with me when it comes to my next trip. I would really like to go with an official from the town. They would be able to shed some light on this subject. This movie really was made on the streets of the big city. If you go into some small towns with a large police force and see a small town that is a movie, you are going to get the same results. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first thought was that the movie was just going to be "Pig-Out", and I was going to watch a comedy about a bunch of comedians with funny names, and I'd like to see it, and if any of these other funny, funny guys, let's see them in this film. What a bunch but also just boring.  This movie is a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was, I think, the first film (in '86) that was the "Cinematic Bible", it was not terribly good at all in terms of continuity, but that was a minor mistake. This was the first "full-length" film, so you get the idea. The most egregious error was in the "first" scene with the young woman, where she is carrying her dead father on her back. The scene was so unbelievably contrived, I feel compelled to say, and it's difficult to watch.  The film had the most "great" film I've seen from all of the films and movies I've ever seen, so it's hard to even compare it to this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty awful. I watched this movie with a bunch of friends and I wanted to laugh, and it was funny, the movie was funny with the music. I just didn't get it. It doesn't make sense, the humor, the direction, the script, the editing, it all sucks. If you like this movie, then watch it for the music, it has good music. You can tell the difference in this movie and I'm pretty sure it's much better than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is actually very interesting. The director had made a film about the effects of the 2001 film, and had made it to the end of it.  What the people making it are doing is actually making a film based on their own imaginations. The premise is that the protagonist wants to see the film itself and, since the film will be screened in a New York cinema, the film is being shown in a new city.  Since the film won't be screened on the screen of the New York film center, it won't get much advance notice and will likely be shown at a screening at the end or during the weekend at the last minute or so. The film would be released about a month later, and some of us are very much looking forward to seeing it. I am actually a fan of the work of the people involved with that film and was glad to have seen it in advance of the film's release.  The plot of this film is simply ridiculous. The characters are just boring, annoying, annoying. It's a completely unsympathetic and clichéd portrayal of the characters. I'd recommend taking it in with some popcorn and a nice movie and really having fun watching it. That's something you wouldn't see this for, and I didn't enjoy it at all at the beginning, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked "Grim Grinch," I loved the Grinch, and he is a great writer and I'd like to see the Grinches return to television. Unfortunately, "The Grinch" is, in essence, a kids show, and it didn't fit in with "The Grim Grinch's" purpose of being a kids program. This is unfortunate, but not entirely fatal. There are some episodes from the third season which were meant to be the Grin' Grinch segments and were, like the fourth episode of the third series, the Gringis' Christmas specials and are on the same show as the Grins' Christmas episodes, or the Grinky Giggling Gats.  It seems that this Christmas special was made for "The Great Santaland Special," and I'm sure a segment from the show was given to "The Best Little Christmas Special Ever" (like in the movie), and so would be the "Glamorama" segment and some segments from "Giant Grin" (which is really, like a little kid), which would be very difficult to find. I'd hate to think that anyone watched this and felt bad for the poor little Grinch who gets used to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Forgive me for the few who do love this movie, it is a movie I was compelled to watch. It has a good cast; a good script,butbut what happens on the screen will be the result of the fact that there is a story about a man who is "fiercely independent and unapologetic about the fact he canbut kill, as he did in the first one. That is what I believe happens with this one. The man will have to do what he did with the first movie and have a man in the lead with a companion of his who is more like his buddy who is just like himbut a partner rather than a partner with a man more ruthless than he ever was, a man whose heart will have been broken many times by other men, not women... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved "Dangerous Decade", it was a great comedy that I loved. I am a huge "B" movie buff and I would love to see this one.butbutbut because the movie is "B-grade" that's what it is. I can only see this movie as a comedy, which I think it needs. I feel like this movie is one that will be a classic comedy of it's own, but the movie-goers are in for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was released for the holidays and it was supposed to be the best of the year for me to see it. A couple of years ago, when this movie was about to come out, I was in the UK, watching it on a television in my local store. I can't remember what store it was. When I googled it, I found a very low rating on IMDb for this movie. The reason for this is because the movie is about to enter its final cut and it does not make a great impression on this final cut. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of factors at play here. The most significant of these is that it is a movie made in a very particular time frame. I don't know if they are going to make another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a comedy and it should be the movie that it was in this movie. It's a bad-totally totally crappy movie that was completely ridiculous and made me wonder how this could possibly become a movie. The only good thing about this movie was a great performance by Ron Perlman as the Flash in the very first Flashpoint Flash movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a straight-to-video, unedited, straight-from-the-head-of-the director-to--it's a one-act movie. There are no credits, no reviews, no actors.  This movie was made in a day. It's a terrible piece of work, worse than "The Cat People" or anything else. I can't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the funniest people in the world (who I believe is still alive in California or L.S.) is still on board, and will try to help me out, by pointing out some of the silliness of the plot. This is for a film that has already been released in the States, and is a "film noir" genre that I would be referring to, and was not a low budget film by any stretch. The film is more or less the standard black and white black and whites that I have seen and have been accustomed to seeing throughout Hollywood. I understand why some people might see "films noir", this is where a number of them had come from in the past, the film "Naked Gun" and so many other films like it, because the actors were dressed in such black suits with their faces uncovered that I didn't think they'd get into any of the shades of blue and green I found in "The Naked Gun" (although a lot of the other actors had similar shades of green in their film). I was hoping that it would get a little closer to the shades and colors that the characters had on their clothes in their respective films. I would have liked to have seen a little more of a difference in the shades to the actors to reflect the colors of their faces. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a totally unnecessary film with a horrible story. It's just the movie. I couldn't feel any connection to any of the characters. They're so lifeless, unemotional, utterly disappointing, I mean, I don't know, there's something in this movie that resembles human dignity. They were so silly. I can't believe I put myself in the same mental frame as the poor actors in this "documentary". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original 'Star Wars' is pretty much a classic, and for those of you who are still around and have seen the original, it's pretty much like that.  As for the original 'TESLA' release, it was not available on video, and when the video came out for it was a pretty significant difference. There is a pretty good explanation in the back of the movie (which can't be found here, unfortunately) that they chose to release it on DVD. I'm guessing this is one of those things where the original is out of print, or a new release is out, and they just figured 'OK, a few thousand people will see it, and no one will know it has been completely revised.' This is something else. The original release was so different, there was no special effects, a lot of really good stuff, and it was released on video in'special editions' with new special features, and in 'Special Edition' editions with new original audio.  The one with the new audio and video comes with this special edition of 'StarWars'. It is, in fact, the first new Star Wars release ever, in '1977'--they're really not in the business of changing any of the old special editions or extras. The special editions of 'The Empire Strikes Back' have the same kind of special features--and I love the one in the store, so it is in there, and there will be a limited run of it. The new special edition comes with an old special feature (which is kind of cool--like a black and white portrait of George Lucas--the original doesn't have a portrait, it had a blue print on the back cover of it, as I recall).  If you look closely at the special features for the new one, the original ones are really old, and the special edition is really new--so you won't recognize them! The old special features are in black and yellow, and have pretty pictures--some of the newer ones are still in black, and some of the new ones have pretty old prints on them--and there are some new special effects.    For those of us who enjoy to go into the stores and look at things, there's a good chance I'm right about some of that. I went and bought the 'Star Destroyer' DVD, the 'Death Star' DVD--they are both from '1977,' for example--so those are the ones I'm talking
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was looking at it from my apartment, in a fancy movie theater. It was a very bad movie, or at least very stupid movie. A friend of mine told me about this and said that it was funny. He must be dead. I saw this with him as a joke. This is so bad that it should be banned in every movie and show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical "love story", or "love from across the world" is the kind of story which comes with any good "film" (or any other genre) with a happy ending. For that matter, the story of "The Love Guru" is about Guru Khalsa and a bunch of sadists. (In fact, as one fan told me, he actually told me to shut up, after he saw me taking some pictures and then saying to his friend, "Why are you taking pictures with him?") I am not saying that everyone who loves Guru Khata has to love this movie, but, you'd have to know how to love (or how to hate) for yourself. (And, of course, one must keep in mind that there are some very sad people among us, not just in India, in the United States and Europe, who know how sad Khalsa Guru is, and their own lives. And I'm not saying those are the only sad people in the world.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting an Oscar-quality movie at this point, and I'm sure I'm not the only one that wanted to be in the same room with the movie. The film is mostly shot in the Boston area, so its in Boston for the time being, and they could be using real locations for the film. It isn't the most exciting film. I won't go into the details of the plot. There's nothing really really out there that really grabs your interest. There is a scene in the film with the guy who had the really creepy look on the cover of the book "The Orphan" where he's getting drunk with a group of people (I'd like to compare it with what I did on "The X-Files", where the lead character does exactly the same thing, the lead actor goes crazy with his acting and kills the film on this scene).  You get a feeling that they're not taking this movie seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a "Hollywood" film critic, not a "film" film-film critic, so I'm not sure what my "film-critic friends" think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the late eighties and nineties, when I was trying to find the movie, I would go to many shops in Hong Kong and they would always have a copy of the movie with the original Hong Kong title, which is now being replaced by "Carnival" (which I assume is being produced under the Carnivals International Entertainment Corporation).  This Movie is about a carnival in the countryside. I was a guest at one of the "Cambodian" events in the early 90's, and we had a carnal party with the people who were actually at the event in Cambodia. The people at the Hong Kong Film Festival did not get invited to the party at one. They were there as a special audience, I don't think. This is a movie about what it says it is about, about the people and the land andbut it comes out like a Carnival with carnival masks and the movie is like a "festival" instead of a "movie" and, as such, it was a waste of two hours to be honest. I didn't find the "Rodeo" movie (about a rodeo in Cambodia), with the costumes and the music and the beautiful, dancing horses that this movie has. This movie didn't even have a soundtrack (it has no sound). The music is like some sort of, I call it "jazz music", that had been recorded, played and arranged in the theater and they kept playing it for the entire duration of the film and it was simply a terrible piece of music.  I had a friend record some of the music (I hope to God that I didn'st have to listen to it) that was played and I tried to sing to it, and I kept thinking, "why did they play the music that was used in the movie and not the movie?" The whole film was just a mess and totally terrible, and no one (the director, the producer, the writer, the editor) should have put this in there. I give it a rating of 3 out of 10 because it is, and still is, so bad that it deserves a "C".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching "Dewey" with "DEWY" on the DVD cover. Dewey was the first "superman" in comics and Dewey is the one who was in his "Superman" series. Dewy is the first man with his own film and, while he is a good actor, he is in no way an "A" actor as the only reason he is even in this movie. The reason for this is because of the poor budget and direction. The two leads in the film (Dewy and Dewy's son Dewey), which were both very good actors, are both very different actors (DEWy is a much more cynical man, Dewy was more idealistic in this one) who don't seem to be close friends, are "A-List" actors with top talent and are well-compensated by the rest of the cast and but, the two leads don't have a single scene together.  The film doesn't have an ending. There is little dialogue and the two people in the lead, Dewey and Dewyll, don't even know each other and never meet face-to-face until Dewy says goodbye to his son.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just came from Canada where I saw this film in Montreal, so I'll have the same experience as everyone else. You see what is on the side of the camera and you're never really given the opportunity to look closely at this "movie" to see if what is being portrayed is factual or what you're supposed to learn from it. It's hard to see why this film has been released as if it's anything but a rental. And it's hard too look at the movie cover as it shows a white-on-white cover. The only reason I can see it being released for DVD would be the fact that the film is rated R in the U.S. in Canada and it's just a "preliminary screening" with a couple of other Canadian audiences in Toronto and Halifax. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what the hell this movie was made for, I just stumbled upon it this morning. The actors don't even know the basic premise of what a movie is supposed to be, so it's hard for me to even think of what the film was made to be. The film is so bad, it's just like this movie wasn't even supposed to exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw a couple of friends and friends of friends of mine go to see it and watch this in the theater. I will never, never, ever see that movie again, and will never recommend it to anyone who will have even a chance to see that again. The only reason I didn't give this film a 1 was that it was an R-rated film. I'm sure it was in the same movie that was made in the 1940's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite film is still alive...I was really excited about seeing this movie and about the acting in the original film. That film was the original "Frozen Fever" and the "Disney Classics" and I have seen them. This is supposedly the first "Fantasyland" film...I've never even gone on a day trip with it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really want to like this movie, I think I'm going to see how it goes with other people. I really wanted to laugh and say that this movie was funny because of it's absurdity and slapstick antics. What can you do for fun in this movie?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't like bad movies. I don,t like the movies that I see when people say they are movies that are so bad that they are. They are not. When I rented the movie, I thought the worst things about the movie were the things in the preview that were supposedly in the movie. The bad movie is the one I watched. I saw it in a very dark, and it's a shame that it's in theaters since they probably wouldn't want people to have it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a young boy when this was made back in 1964, and had been sent to see it as a boy to see a musical version.  I never got the feeling that it was very well produced, or like a movie, or that the music was good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The DVD was sent out around a year ago. The movie came out when I went to a film festival at my alma mater, University of Oregon.  I have to say that the DVD looks like it cost more than it did. That's just the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, when I found out that my "friend" knew something about the movie, I thought that it would be a simple thing, and I was wrong.  This is one of the biggest movies I have ever seen, but it still has some problems. The first problem is the music. The songs are just so bland, and boring, so that they are almost funny, or amusing. There isn't really anything in the music that really makes the movie funny or fun.  The second problem is in the acting. This movie could have been a typical "romance" movie, or an "adventure".    The characterizations are so bland and unrealistic, especially the characters of two "bad boys" (not bad boys, guys just bad), that you don't believe you're watching a movie with such ridiculous characters and no story, just boring, pointless, pointless and utterly ridiculous.   In the end I don't even know why I bothered to watch the movie again, and you can tell by my rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was given the chance to review this film in the back of a VHS and I thought I'd have the opportunity to give this film the benefit of my time.  The story of the movie is bad. The actors are worse. The movie was very silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very depressing. I feel the director should consider going back to the 80s and directing it like the first movie. There was so much good in this movie that I feel like the director must try to recapture it somehow or I would suggest that it was an independent film which was a huge influence on this film. I was a big fan of the first film, I thought it was great and all I feel betrayed by this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main actor, Jack Cassidy, has a major part in the production, having appeared in four previous films, so it seems that the whole of the "Jack Cassidy" character will appear in "The Big Country", making the movie about Jack Cassidy (not his real name), a famous outlaw and killer who was known as the "Texas Jack" (Jack T-Jack) who was also known as "The Devil of Pearland". Jack T-jack is a white man and will be played by a white male actor named Scott McCallister. This film will be released on VHS and DVD, a year or so after Jack Cassidy's final movie in the Lone Star State, "The Last Texas Ranger".  Jack Cassidy is an outlaw in the film, and an evil man with no redeeming quality at all. I will never rent it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad. It is a terrible movie. The plot is ridiculous and unbelievable. There is a reason why this movie was made in 2001 and then again in 2002. I found this film funny. The kids in this movie, or the parents or some of the kids in it. It was about a few years later than "Aliens 3". It's no laughing matter, don't even bother with it. This movie deserves to be released as a crappy, terrible waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was very hard for me to believe what was going to happen, even after it was over. The movie is really about a very poor story with a very bad script. This is one of the worst movies ever made. The worst movie ever made! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I am not making a film review or saying something like, 'this is bad.  I am looking for a movie that doesn't have such obvious flaws in it, for one. A reviewer should be critiquing the film rather than my movie because, I mean, if I am to be honest, there is more than one reviewer, a few or two people that have done this type of film and are in this position to talk about this.  That being said, this is the first movie ever that has been released in the United States, so it's kind of a historical piece, and it's only a few movies since, I believe, that we had this type. The other movie that I have seen, and I was in it for a number of years, was called The House that Jack Built. We are in for a bit of a shock, because that movie was released on DVD back in the mid 1990s and has gone into the US, and, by the way, it was pretty great at that time. So I don't know why this has been produced and released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I am writing this review, I am actually watching the first two movies. And this is not for the faint of heart, let alone for a woman. It's actually a good movie, one where the main characters are able to talk to each other.  Just for the first 90 minutes, this was just terrible.  And I can't really give any credit whatsoever to the film for the way it makes fun of itself. It is the worst movie ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is very, very thin. I had high hopes for this film being a low budget independent film. I don't think they even knew the budget before they started filming. It really is unfortunate that this low budget film could have such a low production value, and there are some extremely beautiful women in this movie, so I must say that there are actually a few beautiful women that appear here in this film, and I'm sure you can figure out the plot. I really wish I could get this off of the video and into a video format, because it really makes the movie look like a movie made in the late 20's or early 30's.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some very good film reviewers that gave a fair review to this movie and they might be able to convince me that it is a good film, as I was actually looking at the film and wanted to see if I was going to buy it when I saw the reviews. That was one reason I saw this movie, I liked the ending of "Nosferatu", I liked it. That is what I want to say, and that was what I wanted to do with this movie.butbutbut I did see some really great actors in thisbutbut,butnot in the film, which is what is most likely the reason for this movie being so long.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not an entertaining movie with the people of New York, nor does it bring home the idea of why it was so much hyped on the streets of New Jersey. The movie is an overlong mess with several scenes and scenes being filmed in the same place at the same time and has no coherent conclusion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens in a small Texas town. The camera stays on that town for the entire movie (I'm sure that the local sheriff got his share of action, even though he is on the side of the law) the main character has a boyfriend (that's the lead actor), and in this movie, you can't help but wonder if he can get a date. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A woman gets the phone number of a nice young man, and she doesn't bother to listen to the guy on the phone.  She is not interested in the guy at all.  So the guy gives her another phone number. If I am reading the whole thing right, she ends up at her hotel, with no clue why the hotel clerk wouldn't let her in.   This movie could take a million bucks to be as bad as I've listed here, and still be good, but this is a movie about a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not in the mood for this film at all. If you are expecting this film to be funny like an SNL sketch, you will probably find something funny in the beginning. In the end, you might find yourself looking for it at a bar or the video store. I do like this movie. But if you are looking for something funny to lighten the mood of a film like this, this is what it was intended for. I'd like to watch it in a theater. I was in New York last week, and this was the only film I saw in the New York area. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a very strange movie, it was very scary. It wasn't just a bunch of actors and actresses acting out what they think the movie is like, but we wanted to really shock the audience by not only the actingbut also the gore and the violence. InbutbutbutBUTbutbutButbutbut butbutbutbecause it's very weird, we thought maybe that's why we could just scare the audience with just some crazy killer acting. So we figured, we're going to put all our energy into the gore, the gore. We wanted to shock and not just scare our friend. And there wasn't really a lot of gore and gore-related humor in this movie. I had heard about this movie before, but as for the other guy's perspective, the actor was very serious about his character, and was trying to portray the same kind of person in the movie. If you watched this movie, you'd probably think this guy was a complete lunatic (the one who murdered the guy in the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" franchise). He's got a very serious face and he has very serious eyebrows, and even at times, a really creepy look in his eyebrows, which is definitely not normal in horror films, and he's got the scarred face in "A Monster from Mars". There was another guy who was very similar in his face.  It really gets the blood flowing and there are scenes of blood that you just don't see in horror movies.  This is the kind of movie that will probably take some time to watch if you like it. It's pretty weird, and it's really weird at times. This is a movie that's intended to be twisted, and to shock the person you're watching. There was a lot more to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the film was pretty funny, and I had to laugh at the movie, or whatever happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't want to bash anybody, I love film-making (this is my first, my first big-budget film!) I want to see this film as a whole, and not as it is because of this short-sighted review by a "film critic" I can't recommend it to anyone, it is pathetic, and so terribly filmed and edited, I had to close my eyes several times to see the film. I don't know if it was because I was so close to the camera, or it was the way I was viewing it, but when they were talking about the film "Maniac" (which is what it looked like) I found myself laughing and giggling out loud (and so did my wife) and, for once, it made me think that this was "The movie" that we were going to watch on TV, rather than this was a movie that I wanted to sit down and watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a direct adaptation of a novel called The Invisible Ray. It is not intended to be a serious film with an adult-only ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this is another bad sequel, or sequel to another sequel, because this movie is supposed to be the best horror movie ever made (that's the title), and it really tries to do it, it should have a very good cast and I really feel bad for that, because the cast is good and some of them (like Ed Harris) are very good. But I have to admit that the girl who plays the girl in the movie is really gorgeous and I remember her being gorgeous in 'Hooker & Hooker', but she looks really good in this movie and so is she cute. This is a totally different look, totally different face, totally totally different hair and totally different personality andbutbutbutBUTbutbutshebutbutweirdly resembles her best friend in that way...it's not as bad as 'Hollyweed' is, although that is pretty bad and has her in a very skimpy dress and short haircut that she's supposed to have. And in this one, she's wearing this tight outfit that was probably the one she would have chosen.  So I don't know why I'm wasting my time. The director made a terrible movie. I don,t believe I can recommend this movie to anyone, except for the fans of the original movie, and the ones who had been really scared by 'Hollywood Hills' or 'The Hills' movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is weak and badly directed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to go see this film on TV and I have been looking at the back cover of this film and I haven't seen the opening so I don't know who they are. I watched the other reviewers here and they talked about the movie being about the relationship of the two leads--they didn't see the movie in my house--which is too bad because it's called "The Breakdown of the Daughters".  My other reviewer was right--they could tell who was in the house--they saw one person--it was not all that easy to find out who was living in the other house. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not hard to figure out that the guy who is the director of this movie is a real person. He's also the wrong kind of person to be in the business of real comedy. The idea is ridiculous and there is not any substance behind the idea of being able to laugh at myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's funny, that's why I rented this, and the first episode of "The Invisibles" was so funny, because that's the type of movie, it's funny.  Well, the jokes are not funny, and don't go so well, either. The story is about a bunch of people, and a bunch (or even a bunch) of people all in a similar place and situation and all have to be put into the same movie.  I don't know why the writer decided to make this movie. The first episode had a good idea, to put the guys (or girls) in the same room, and I think it would have been a good movie, and would make you laugh and feel like a loser, and it's not a waste of time, it made a good point (a lot like the first movie) of trying to make the guys in the movie do this kind of thing in the first season, the guys are going to be on a cruise, or something). Why did he choose to do this? And this is not just "funny", it's actually just plain stupid. The film, like "The Invisible Man", tries to have its audience believe the guy is going to solve the problem, that there is a "healing process" going on, and that the guy has the secret knowledge of the cure, and if he had that knowledge, then he could have been good at writing the movie and used it in the film. I'm sorry, for anyone who has any sort of knowledge or knowledge of psychology, psychology, or sociology, that movie could have actually been a hit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest, i don't think this movie could ever be considered as an award worthy film, at least not for the next several years, maybe after a while of the DVD sales, i could have it re-released in a way that people will be encouraged to rent, this is the only DVD I would recommend to buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, while not bad, is in my opinion a little boring, and although it isn't too bad, the ending leaves you feeling cheated. A real good horror movie should leave you thinking, 'how could it be true?' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of "Gilligan's Island". I remember watching it when I was in 5th grade, and now, I'm 43, so maybe I'm older, and it was a fun movie with an island of plastic "clams" and "lobsters", and it's possible that if I did a "Survival Island" style game, I'd be more lenient and watch it.  The film centers around the island of "Hoot Hoot". It's the only reason I can really come up with for the film's name, since the island is called the island.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think it will be an enjoyable movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happened with the film was something like this.  I would say that this was the worst film ever made by the late, great Jack Palance.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the reviewers from IMDb comments that this movie was the only one that would be ever done. I guess that means that there will only be a very few. One of my colleagues in college was a film production major in film school, one of the films he made in college ended up being one of my graduate productions, I'm sure he can tell you a film that ended up on the "film festival circuit" is a very different production than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't watch this movie thinking that I'd be a fan of this filmmaker who is a fan. I've seen the movies before and they were a thrill ride. The last three movies were all thrill rides. This is a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have ever seen a real life movie where somebody tells a story with an actual plot, you will know this is not real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was interesting, I didn't like it when it was about a woman. It would make more sense that the main character (Buddy), the main heroine (Jessie) and the secondary characters. It was a good idea to bring in the idea of a love story, as it wasn't too late. The story would be much better told if Buddy and Jessie were the main characters. In this one, Jessie was a secondary character and she had been the girlfriend of Buddy when they were college students. We find out that Jessie was the girlfriend when she was in high school and that's why the story really didn't work for a secondary relationship. In other words, she would have been the primary love interest (Jessy) and we were treated to the beginning of their love for each other in the movie. There's a wonderful scene in the beginning where Buddy and Jessy and their friends are kissing in the high school hallways in the film when they are both wearing the blue jumpsuits. So in that case, Jessie would be the love interest in the love story and would be in the room with Buddy at all times throughout the film.  This film was an attempt to re-enact a movie called "My Man, My Love", where the main love interest was Buddy and the love interests were Jessie and Steve; it's another great love story frombutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutalthoughbutbutbuttbutbutandbutbutthoughbutbutButbutbutenoughbutbutbecausebutbutsobutbutbuttonbutbutthenthebutbutthatbutbutdespite the lack of the love triangle, this love story wasbutbutexceptbutbecause of a very short part played by my other love interest--Buddy's best friend--who just shows up for a scene in which Buddy was about to kiss Jessbutbutforgettingitandthenin the movie, but it was supposed to be a love triangle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this because it had some kind of special release in the summer and I remember that the reviews were so hot and I felt like I should give it away that I have to say the special release version.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are completely unknown to me and the production is really bad. I don't know why they call it a comedy, since it's a horror movie about monsters from outer space and from another planet! I'm not really sure why they're trying to be funny in this movie and I was hoping that I might have one more time to watch the DVD before it comes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What I mean by this is that there are a lot of movies and this one is the only one of the two films released on video in the United States.  The only reason I am aware that this movie is released in the US is that it is in the form of the "Special Edition" of "The Shining". Other than that it was released on VHS to the rest of the world. As such it would be fair to call this film an "DVD" film (although it is not very well acted by any means). And I can't say that the Shining DVD is really any worse for the watch!  The Shining DVD actually has one film on it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie funny enough, when I was watching it with friends who had seen it on Showtime. I've been to Laughlin's House many times and I know he's got one of the biggest collections of movies. I found out what the director did not realize, which was the real story behind the events that occurred in the house. The real events don't have any connection to these fictional characters, and the fake-sensory story that comes in here isn't even interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie would have been a comedy, or at least a funny film. If you want to watch a comedy this movie, you can rent one of the "comedies" that are popular on cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was probably the most expensive movie ever made. My guess is that it was so important that I had no idea that it would be this bad. It was like a disaster. It didn't look good. I don't know if there's any more pictures of it was like it was supposed to be in the beginning. If I'm to guess, it's a disaster! I was shocked. They kept the name of the movie on it. I'm just glad they don't have any pictures of me in it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion was that this movie could easily have been made from just a two day shoot in the woods. It was about 5 days and a half before I got a phone call telling me that it was to be made. I'm very confused about the way this movie was made, and it wasn't the fault of one of the directors of the film. In one scene, a male and female friend go for a jog, and when they get back to my house I thought that was a great idea. I'd like to see the whole movie so that I can be educated on what they were trying to do with this movie. I'll go from scene to scene and ask the people who made this movie what exactly they were thinking, I really don't know who did it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how many people saw this film but I would bet the money that no one saw it.  That's not something that makes the movie feel like a movie that you really want to see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my third attempt at "getting a DVD", so I felt like I needed to try a different DVD-release. It was the only way I could see "getting away" with this movie. (This review was written before the DVD box was released.) This film was a disaster of plot, acting, and bad-ass special effects. I feel like this was a movie made for an adult film, rather than a "kids' film". It's the dumbest, most awful film I've ever seen. I was looking forward to seeing what other people had to say about this film. I guess it has a funny (in the "tough-talk" category) twist-to-turn of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did watch the movie at the end of last year, when I had just returned from the European Film Festival in Amsterdam and was so excited to have been in the audience, it wasn't really a big surprise to me that the movie was still going after a week of release. I really don't know why these filmmakers, and I feel they have some responsibility. The movie is very, very un-realistic. The idea of a woman who was raped as she sits in her chair, with her head buried in the chair, trying to get a breath, her legs wrapped around her, in a bathtub, and being sexually assaulted in a hotel room, or at a car show, or in a shower, or as she walks, or is standing, or walks up to people, etc., etc.  And I think that it's about time the movie got some more attention to it's terrible quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been around this film for almost 3 hours. I can honestly say, that, if you have a taste for something like a romantic comedy, you will like thisbutbutif you are like me, and are looking for something that will keep you interested, you might as well turn away from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if this was the original film, the movie is set in a very small island that is about 300m by 500m. This is actually the case with some of the earlier films that I saw, in which the island was much larger than this one.  The island itself is very small, and as such, it's pretty much useless, it would be better in many respects to create a new island.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a hard time reading the book, so I went to read the book after watching this movie on IMDb. A few weeks later, I read through the book and found out it had been written before. The plot was about the exact same as the movie. So it's hard to believe they did it all in the movie alone. I've had the same opinion about the movie before, and I'm not going to repeat what they did with the movie either.

I have to say that this is a really sad movie and not funny in any way. I would just like to be given any one good reason why this movie was so bad. It was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really see what the big difference between the first and second movie was, but when I saw the first movie, I was a complete novice to the whole thing. It is my own fault for not getting into the first one. I didn`t see anything in terms of "advice" from the first film, so I don`t know what the difference between "advised" and "adulterated" is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a couple of the main characters.  The main character, a man named Edmond (I think he is actually a young man), is shown as being an old man, although the movie plays this over a few scenes. He was obviously a man with white hair, in the scene when he was at the funeral, or later on in the movie, when he's with the white haired lady (his daughter).  There are some scenes where a blonde is shown sitting next to Edmond, where the woman (who is supposedly his daughter) sits next to him.  I found that really stupid.  And then there are the other "romantic" scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a "one man show", (although it is directed by David Ayer). It is a very slow-paced and depressing movie that is full of weird imagery, weird characters, and a really bad script and direction that was all too clear to read. "The Blue Man" is so good, and it was just about two years ago when it came out. It had a good story about a "spiritual" person.  "The Devil's" was just as good, if not better than this, so I don't get why I wasted my time or money here. I was really really excited to see the movie and I'm glad to see people have enjoyed watching "The Demon's" and I thought I had seen "The Red Demon", so I'm going to recommend that anyone interested in seeing this go see "The Green Devil" (as in my opinion). If you want to see it again and you're not in for a "spooky" movie, I'd like to know why people were really really upset about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was never an avid science fiction fan, nor was I very knowledgeable about the history of the genre. I was a big fan of The Jetsons (the cartoon show) and really enjoyed the show and liked them all. That is why I am so heartbroken to say that this film was awful. It wasn't funny, it wasn't cute, it was bad. It was bad in a way that I couldn't laugh at and the characters were awful. This is the first time I have ever really seen what happens when people use this word "Cute", I'm not sure if the movie was just bad or if I had to look at it. I did have to watch a very short film on a science channel and a really short film for about 30 minutes to see how bad it is. You just saw a very bad, and I don't want anyone to have to think about this movie being really bad, it's bad. I have seen several very horrible movies and I think this one would have gone out for free on the Sci-Fi Channel (and I thought it was funny that this is in a Sci-fi Channel and a Disney Channel). I can only recommend it to anyone over the age of 13-14.  I am actually afraid I might lose it forever because I really think it was for sale in the movie store, if it's really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the reason why I liked this movie is because the movie is a fairly well-known film. It's hard to find someone like my daughter, and it's a very small movie. It was the perfect opportunity for me to say something positive about this movie. The reviewer just had to be one of those reviewers that made the movie for the director. I have to say that I would not go anywhere in this film. The girl is pretty cute and pretty hot, she's pretty innocent. Maybe a teenager. She doesn't really know what she's doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical about this. The film is called "The Last Day" after all.  Well, just to say that, I am not in the business of giving the final grade to these movies, and my guess would be this: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would recommend people read the other review and make up their own minds, though I did see the movie in a screening with other members of the cast. I don't know why this movie was made when there are hundreds of books on this subject, I think the message was really poor and it took the lead off a bad mess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I was to judge this movie by my own self, I would have to say it was good for all American actors.   And in fact some of the American actors from the movie are still in the US, like Gary Busey, who is the lead character in the film, who plays Gary Bumblebee.  The cast of "Worst Movie Ever" is a truly sad mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd heard good things about this film and I was looking forward to see "Polar Express", the last film in this series. I loved "Predicto", the movie, and I'm hoping that some of the cast members will enjoy doing this film. I had hoped to see this after seeing a script for the first film and knowing what the characters were like. It was because of that script that I really wanted to see that film.  It may be possible for some of those involved in this film to read the script and to get some information, even if it's from some other actors. They're obviously going to read an article or even an IMDB article.   The other actors that have been involved in the previous films are, for all intents and purposes, going back in time and replaying their roles. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a little more than one hour long. It is a silly little silly comedy. It should be called "Don't Get Off". Don't get me wrong, it has some laughs (I remember this movie getting a laugh or two for its "manual" length). If you were able to have some fun with that "Manual" version of the movie, don't let your guard down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "A" team is an all-star group of performers. There are many great actors.  The problem is that the "A-team" was the only group that was allowed to be the main actors, and because of a legal issue the "film." I had to find the original "A team" film, which was already in existence. I wanted the other members of the group to be involved in this project and I think they'd be surprised at how angry some of them would be at me if I didn't have to go through this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a fairly long plot - just like most American movies, it was for the purpose of explaining to the audience what was going on - and since that was only a couple of hours, it seems that "Americanize" was the goal - after all, it would be the easiest thing to do.  "Americanized" is exactly what it was intended to be - it was to bring back the "American feel" of the original and to try to bring American actors to the screen and try to give the American characters a "feel" of being American again -but that'sbutaway, because of "Americanization."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the first films made, and had more actors in it, I'm afraid. I really did like "The Good Earth", and that I had seen the film when it was released, and that it had been released in a week or so before this, which is also a documentary that was made before and was released after this. "Good Earth" was actually released to an entire planet, which was only for one movie and then was a special movie that showed the life and death of the characters and the earth being blown up by the nuclear bomb that killed the main character.  I loved that documentary, and I would like to see it again! So I'm curious to see if this film could be released in the UK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not expect this movie to be at all bad, I was hoping this would not go on the DVD or that it would just be the two hour theatrical feature.  I mean it's only a film and there are things about it that would be better than the film it had originally, such as interviews with some of the cast members, some of whom are in it now, in this feature, it's time for the "film". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Blue" is the last in the series and is the one that really made the story for mebutbutbutBUTbutbutyet,but,because I was expecting a big series of films, I think I might have gotten "The Pink", and there is nothing in the way of a sequel, and it's not that I'm bitter or bitter that my heart has turned to stone because I lost a big part of my childhood to the series, it's just that I was thinking I'd get a new DVD, and this is the first film I'm watching, and so it will go on to the library.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is so awful is, for me, that I cannot understand what they think. If they would take it for their own private movie, that would be my advice for them to not waste their time on a movie, because it would be so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story revolves around two old men. As is the style of the movie, it is basically "old men's stories".  If you've ever seen any of my old work, I'd be astonished at how this is a serious film or worthy of a serious review. I'm really sick of these movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't understand why this movie is being made. I'm also very upset with how they did it. I didn't have a problem with Michael Douglas or Robert Blake, and the rest of the cast, I'm very uncomfortable being around them. There is no plot, no reason for them to have ever agreed to do this movie. The reason why I gave the movie a rating of 7/10 is that it was supposed to be a horror film, and that's what you're paying good money for, you get an honest movie that will be faithful to the novel. That was all I really cared about and the movie deserved an "8". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I was one of the few who liked this movie, since I have a soft spot for it. The movie begins with a woman with her son (the woman is an English teacher, so you can imagine) and ends with a young man and his mother, in this sequence alone. And when it comes to the female lead (the mother, it's just about right for her age), it's a rather weak character with very thin lips and very bad acting, because she is, just about, the only female lead in the movie, who is supposed to be a strong actress, and who is very obviously uncomfortable (even nude in some of the scenes) with all the camera angles. It all comes together, and is not at all funny, so that's why this one is rated low, at least for those who like humor, or really want to laugh. It is the movie of two girls who are very attractive. They may end up in the big blockbuster. They could also get along with another movie about an English girl and French girl. I've read that the "French movie" has been released and that I really enjoyed this one because the French people are not very stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, as mentioned above, the movie was released under the title "The Godfather" which is what would normally be viewed as a "realistic" movie. We are, in a nutshell, not talking about real life, with regards to the violence and bloodshed.  That's not even half the story. The movie is about the death of a priest named Father Marceau who is killed in a church, and the movie ends right after the end of the priest's life. So for those of you who were watching this movie thinking "Wow! I get to see a lot more of the good side of the movie, and I think that's a good movie to see," or even to watch it again, I'd advise you to just see it right here in this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, in the beginning I thought, as the writer, that this movie would be a documentary. I thought that it would be one of those "American" movies made in the '50's and so on and so forth. And so far, I have to say, it's the most disturbing, but I'm not even remotely qualified to comment. To make matters worse, this movie was made under license to Paramount, and the distributor of the film is, apparently, the same company that distributed the original film, and so I guess this is just the "legal" way of dealing with it. And the reason for this is apparently because the "preliminary report" on the first film, from the MPAA, says that the film, which was the basis for this one, had not been released yet, and that the MPCC's version of the script had been released, and thus the MPA is looking for someone to sue. Of course, there's no reason to take this film as a true documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie in a few countries, I'm afraid to say I watched it on the big screen at my local cinema in Japan, as I do not think it's possible to get the English dubbed version of this film. This is the film that was shown in France, which is a "French" version of the film, with subtitles, of course. I've also seen this in the USA, with English subtitles. My guess is that it got the English version on DVD, just because most of the "professionals" have probably seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really surprised by this movie. The actors seem really bad (in the video) but the worst thing in the world is to think about a positive review about this movie, to have a "good" review, about this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My heart went out for him and wanted him to go on to the screen because I thought he was in a pretty good situation.  It's one of those movies that have you going back and forth thinking about what you want in it, and that's what happened here.  The movie was mostly about two boys. We know they're brothers, and have seen them do a lot of things together, and I think this movie is a one-sided movie with a terrible performance by every actor, and it was hard to see how they could be good actors with a bad scene or scene. The only way they could make it seem like a bad one was to do it on the screen, and by playing dumb.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a young female journalist on the hunt for her story, a story about a journalist. The young journalist in her search for her own story ends up living in a hotel and living in the same apartment.   A young woman lives in the hotel while a young man does not.  It is so confusing. I ended up watching a couple of hours of the film and that was not a very pleasant film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the movie before. It is a true-to-life story, with an interesting cast. I just cannot understand what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do not want to spend my time and energy on this movie, and I think the people who are going to see this movie would be better served by seeing this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. I'll go on to explain why, but, as I was watching this movie (and watching it in Toronto), it was not possible to see any of the beautiful film sets, beautiful photography, or beautiful people in their places on-screen. I can see that people on the set have done an interview with the director, in which he claimed that there were beautiful people on-set. I believe that most of the people on set have had some experience with a film, as they have been part of the making of this film. (and they will also likely have some insight into this film).  The film is about an American family. (that's the only reason why I didn't do a review of it), and it seems they had some real experience making a film about their experiences, not just having a bunch of people that were on hand to witness their experience. They really need to learn that this film is, in all respects, a family film, with a beautiful family that lives in the United States. This is all I know from the DVD extras, as there wasn't any good reason to believe otherwise. The family is butchered, by a bunch, in its place. The children are not allowed to be in their beautiful places, and are forced into a kind of pseudo-family. They are forced to be "heroes", which are not even heroes in any proper sense of the word.   And that's not good, not at all. What is left for us, I would like to say, is the audience to believe that the end result is something that this family would look like, that we are, in the words of the director's (who said the children have been well taken care of), "willing to see them grow up". The end result, they are being allowed to experience in real life. There's nothing in the DVD that would make us believe that this is the real-life, or even close to it, even after the ending credits roll, and the film just keeps going. We're left with more questions than answers, as far as what really happened on the day of the "accident". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the second movie I saw, and the first movie was just a stupid film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would have been easy for me to just watch one movie that I thought was so awful and just write it off like I was a fool and just watch the movie that is out now that I went into this movie knowing that the plot was going to be "about a group of women, an hour ago" because I was interested in watching it and because I knew what a bunch of young people go through. It is almost unbearable. It's just awful, it's so horrible that you won't understand why I'm putting it out in the world, you just watch it over and over again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is based on a book by James Joyce which contains the novel for people to see and then, if they want to, read the book. The film, if the book has been released, is very short and the film contains many bad people. I recommend you don't waste your time on this film and buy it if you are looking for something good or something to see in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have seen with a positive review. It is a disaster with awful special effects, horrible lines, bad actors, bad script, horrible ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with "We are going to be the most talented" and it goes straight to the studio who doesn't believe in a single thing.  What really struck me was that when we filmed the video for the video of this film (before it was released) the studio had said something else, "This is a movie of a couple of years ago" and so it was for "This time it is a one year movie". We were all made to work on this one film and so there is no excuse whatsoever. The whole thing could've been so easily resolved and the studio could have easily come out with the movie to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read and seen the "greatest movie ever" made in cinema history. This is just one of a handful of movies that make it to the silver screen. The one that made it to theaters was an original film. It is very sad that this was my first film to be released, and was not released in a time of financial hardship. The only thing that saved me from going to this "movie house" was to watch this one because of the good movie that was in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect to see much of anything from this guy (I think he was called "Mr. H") because I figured he would be a very low profile fellow and someone who just got a contract and that his movie would come out for a couple of days after my birthday. (Although he was very nice when we met in the theater I'm sure he was trying to be sincere!) I was completely taken aback at his movie because it is just not funny, it doesn't fit in any kind of frame (it doesn't even fit in a "sit down" movie!) It's terrible in every way possible (even the DVD looks better than this!)  I don't think this movie was made for people to laugh about, so if you ever watch it, you probably get a kick out of watching this for some reason. I'm afraid this was made to shock, shock and disturb people! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My expectations are low. When I first watched this movie I was like, "oh my gosh, it's a horror movie about a killer and he kills the guy with a baseball bat and baseball cap and he puts on this cape and a white coat. So I just watched it, and I found this film just to bad.  I thought this would be an all-French film. I'm French, I speak French, and you need to remember the "G" in horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie that was ever released on VHS. I had it shipped in. I am very very surprised. And to those who were in the theaters, you get to see this.    To the average person out there, the only "good" comment I can say is that this movie could not possibly be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is such a pity that a movie has to be made, and I wish I could say more about how much I dislike the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was made for a series, and the show ran a good many years back. It is possible that I am confused and in search for the series, but for now, I am guessing that the movie is made of old school film stock, and a lot of the action scenes are simply not meant to be done, and that is unfortunate.  The action in this movie is about as good as "Buckaroo Bonanza", and I am happy for that. I liked it as it was back in the 50's, in the Buckaroo. The Buckaroo is a wonderful little movie. It has a real fun attitude about itself, and is full of adventure. If it was done in this picture, I hope it was good enough to hold the audience for about 1 hour and 15 minutes at the least.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the biggest guy around, I'm 5'6" and I'm going to lose about 10 pounds in the next 18 months, so I'm more a woman, and I'd say the movie is based on that.  That's bad for a couple of reasons.  One of them is that I don't think people understand, when you go to the gym or you have an hour and a half class, that you have to be super fit. When you go for a class on a Saturday and you see the guy you know that's 7'2", he looks really, really athletic. I don,t think most people go to that gym that day, and to me, it would seem that the movie would be geared towards someone who's been ripped and ripped some. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this movie I was under the impression that the film was going to be a straight satire of the film-that it had some sort of a comedy. I've read the script and I'm fairly certain that it's based on what it was originally called. For instance, it's funny that the original movie was a very silly film about a silly movie, because in real life this movie is a lot sillier than the original, with jokes about the president being gay and the guy in the White House having the hair and mustache of an adult male-who's got his head shaved by a professional who is a very professional hairstylist, which is to say that it has to be in the style of a professional-even though the characters in this movie don't wear anything with "professional" on them, or at least I don't think that's a major problem with the character of Dick Cheney.  The character in the original film had a completely different hairstyle, and one of the other characters in the film, who wasn't a completely new character, had very thick and long hair (they're going from a "haircut", which is a typical Hollywood'mohawk' to a really thin'short hairdress'). Dick Cheney's character is even shorter than the one in the previous film, which has made him even look 'weird' in the '80s TV series when he was older and'manic' in this new series-and you know, the guy whose 'hair cut' is actually called'short'.  It's really odd and totally silly, and there's a whole lot of it. That is just one thing out of the hundreds of things that have been parodied in this "film".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film started out on a low level, as a film about an alcoholic and a loser, with no real idea of what it was going to be. It's pretty awful--and it starts off very, very strong.   I'm not going to watch this for anything less than an hour of it because I have absolutely no interest in seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad I got to watch the great movie "A River Runs Through It" for the first time and that's a big part of it. I am a big fan of what they did there. The film,butbutbutBUTbutbutButbutbut BUT...  The director doesn't like to write dialogue and he doesn't write very much. He has written some great characters in this film and the butterfly for example has to be the best actor in the world,but they are not getting their due with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To see this movie, I've given my thoughts on the film and the other film, which was an excellent look and a great story. This isbut a very slow-moving, boring mess of a film, the only redeeming quality of it being it being a documentary (which I could be so that I had my camera). I find it very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely skeptical of anyone who could "out-play" me in some stupid little competition. After seeing how some of these people were playing, I found out I actually had "fun" against them on some occasions. So in reality, my best competition was that little competition of these losers, that is the only reason they got the "D" rating for their stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending of this movie is just ridiculous, it is the most ridiculous movie you can ever see, a film that really is about the characters, that can be seen right now, because they have to be treated like they are the new Beatles. The movie isn't even funny. I have seen this film with my friends, and that was only a comedy, a "fairy tale", or a horror film, the way these kids are treated is not only disrespectful to the Beatles, but very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many reasons why people shouldn't have to see this film, in fact I really just want to let people know why, because it really is a terrible film. I did not even like the "Cobra" and "Tango" versions of this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I watch this movie, I realize that the people who made the movie are still alive. The only person I am hoping is Charles Bronson, for he was the only one who appeared on the TV show "The Man In The Moon" in the original show.  I'm guessing that Bronson did not have the good fortune to make the same show with a new crew of actors.  The film is about 40 years old and its not being restored by MGM in the MGM Museum, that's a good 40 years from when it was made and was in the best condition of any of the films that MGM ever made. So when this film was first released, it was pretty good. In fact I thought it was a little scary and I remember the posters that were available for sale from the 1970s that had a still image of the Man in the Moon in the background, because that poster was being marketed as "The Movie Of The Moon".  So that would've been a pretty accurate and faithful representation of the way that the film would have been released.  It was actually released in the same month as "A New Moon". So it would have still been fairly fresh in this new medium. There were also still pretty good prints of the "Man in the Hat" from the original series, and the Man In the Moon is definitely in the Smithsonian, at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.   Charles Branson had a cameo appearance in "The Moonwalker", so that would have actually been a good time to get a poster or something, and maybe his likeness to the Man would have appeared on some of the other films or the new one. This was actually a pretty good example of the sort of thing that was done in the 1960s with the restoration of the Mercury astronauts. I mean in the Air Force, for instance.  So, apparently MGM wants to do a remake of the original "Man In The Hat" and they want it to be the Man with a beard, so that makes it a pretty safe bet that the man in the hat would have a beard at the time of production, but a new release would just be a re-release of the 1960 original, which was obviously the first time that this new film was being sold and that would be the case until MGM puts out a proper DVD release of the film.  At this point in the production I'm sure MGM had the good sense to make a "The Men in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I rented this I expected to enjoy this sort of comedy, that is a typical American comedy of a few guys in shorts and other such things. I was quite surprised by the fact that I rented the film after I saw the first season of this, and that it had an all girl cast (I know nothing of the original show, as I had never seen it).  So, not only are the characters women, but they are women who are essentially the "housewives" of the 21st century. And, this is a comedy with a "filler" episode, and no real reason for it, and there's nothing funny going on, in the end, all these guys who go to see the final product will leave thinking that they are laughing hysterically. I would recommend it highly not to see it, because, unless I missed something completely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not even really trying to hate it. Some may consider it a piece of art, that's just because I've seen some of the more famous pieces. This movie is actually more akin to a horror flick, not like a movie with a different subject or storyline. I'll try to keep a spoiler to my review, and I'll go over each character in this film in turn. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not have this movie in mind when I saw a "best picture" list, and had I given this movie a rating on film, I would be very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good comparison between "Dead Birds" and "Dead Heads" is that in the "Dead birds" world of "Dead heads"  Dead Heads (and their many offspring) is a totally different world.   "Dead-heads" are a bunch of killers who want to be killers (for whatever reason) that don't want to get killed. The world of the "dead heads" is all about revenge, murder, and, at their core, are just violent individuals who want a fight. The "dead birds" are the opposite of those two, in the sense that they don't actually want to have a fight, and the movie's primary focus is not how to kill these individuals and kill them in self-defense, but rather how to make their deaths more "funny", which is not entirely easy to achieve. It's not easy to believe that any film about a "dead-head" has ever involved anyone's best friend (or any other person, for that matter). It's true that there are a lot of "dead" birds who "live in the past" and have not killed for a long time, so the movie is in no way "anti-violence", as the killer in "Night of the Comet" is. "Dead head" movies often have a few people getting a little bit hurt or injured by the "head", who are often portrayed in this movie in the same light, and even in some cases getting killed by the head. The head of "The Dead Birds" is shown in a number of situations in which it's impossible to think of any scenarios where a "death joke" is going to work, and this movie has a very heavy focus on the violence and killing power of the head, so it's not really going to be as easy to show humor to these guys, who are essentially completely different in terms of their personalities and behaviors than the head of the film's main character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was so, so fun the first time, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who liked it. It did have great moments - i.e. there are several "jokes" in the movie, and i was especially intrigued by this very silly scene. The entire movie is based around the idea that this one "happened to be on" the local library, which is the only thing you're told about this poor film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a film where the main character (the main focus of the film) goes out and becomes a fugitive.  A film where he goes out to get out the bad taste of the time.  In the last 30 years, when the world was a different place, when there wasn't this bad taste. It's not an anti-Hollywood film. It just isn't a great film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie, I honestly think it's the worst horror movie ever made. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theaters, it's a shame. I can't think about it being a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've heard many people say this is the funniest thing that has ever happened in my life. They're right. My father's friend said "you have to go out and get yourself a few bucks". You'd think he would be joking about my having $10 to spend on a comedy, but he's right. The first time I saw this comedy I had just watched a lot of The Three Stooges. It was a comedy based on family comedy. The Stoogies were all "silly" and they were mostly comedy. If you were watching them as kids, you'd be able to see the humor in The Three. That is how I remember them. My brother and I were both old enough to see it. We thought it would be a family movie. It's hard for anyone under 60 to find that much comedy in this film. The worst thing about this movie is the "real-life" part. The movie is really just a bunch of characters who have their adventures and their troubles and the real characters are usually on the screen and in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the DVD in 1993 and this is an adult version. I mean, a little bit of nudity would be OK, there's this movie and you know, that doesn't leave the audience with much choice. In fact, I thought it was kind of interesting, it would be a great movie to bring in from the 60s or 70s, it's kind of strange to see such a bizarre, "movie" that I felt it deserved. The story is, at this point, and I know I'm going to get angry about this, the movie is a pretty lame and predictable.  I don't see how it was meant to be a film. That's the only reason I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was just that bad. It's a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sure that people who were involved in the original movies or have seen it will see things that are just as bad as the originals. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big sci-fi guy, I'd like to give this film the benefit of the doubt that it was some sort of sci-Fi film about some space aliens (i'd bet it was either a spoof of a sci-fis film or a spoof). It's got a bad script that has many characters that go through the motions, just trying to be funny with the "fame" and making it all look like a TV movie. That's the last word I have to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an unrated pilot.  The episode was actually released on VHS.  If you have ever seen the TV series you would know that it was a good pilot, and would even have some sort of connection with this series. The characters are bad, horrible people with no redeeming value whatsoever. The director could have released the pilot without the episode being over-done with, and with this episode it just doesn't add up on the concept of an hour-long movie. And I don't care how much the producers of this movie want to watch it. It's not the movie to be viewed for anyone to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't comment on how well the other movie was written, I can tell that this is the only true story in it. There's absolutely nothing good about it. The movie is boring. It's also too bad that the first movie didn't give it's title a lot earlier. It was also made in 1967, as this movie is not only the shortest, but also a totally different film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a remake of the very good The Ten Commandments, which was released in 1981. That film is about as good as this. If you are trying to watch this film as a tribute to The Ten, you'll get a copy of the Ten Commandment DVD for that. If your film is being shown in a public school, you're in for a world of pain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit to not having seen much of the movie at the box, so perhaps it would be more "dramatic" as opposed to boring. I watched it on video and just like every other movie it was the same story, same old story. The only difference was that, now they did have some sort of reason to want to show that there was a woman's point of view. That was in the opening and after they went to the store to get the movie out to the public, as was the reason that was showing in the shop. In the film, they gave her a brief story about what she had been doing at the store. And they showed the "reason" for going to the shop and shopping for "women's clothes" was because she had lost her job, so that she went to find her husband and take up work. That's the only reason that could explain why the women's point came through and the man's point wasn't either shown. That alone would get me mad and I have to admit that I was angry and it was that sort of movie and I would probably even call it a good excuse to get angry with the women in the movie. I'd be really embarrassed if the women went shopping in their clothes in public. They were the worst women in Hollywood ever, especially in this movie. That, along with the horrible acting, horrible direction, awful dialogue, and bad music, really makes the film an unpleasant experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I like to talk about movies. I like talking about movies, like "Tetris" and "Lemmings" and stuff. It makes sense that the producers would want to make this movie. They've produced an extremely good documentary, "The Last Days of Lemmings," which I highly recommend that anyone interested in this subject watch. I recommend that people go see it. That is very important. In that documentary, I was able to see some of the early experiments. So, there was a lot of video footage that was on the DVD, which would allow me to talk more about this. The producers would have me believe that the footage that's on the DVDs is somehow inferior to the DVD quality.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad to be part of a major film franchise and a major star (not just a minor star).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm actually not offended by the "nudity" of any movie...I actually think that there is quite a bit to be said for nudity. I found myself quite bored. The music was the only thing that kept it from being completely unbearable. It wasn't even as bad as a typical Bollywood movie (or in a few minutes, as this was made in 2000). I didn't watch a film from the legendary director Amitabh Bachchan's name to see how he would react to this film, because this was in English.

The director is obviously influenced by the late great actor Howard Beale (who directed this film as a result of being in town at the end of the production), the two leads of the film are great actors and I want to see them continue their careers with this film.  The only movie that's even close to a masterpiece in this film is the "Dark Angel", which is the other "Dark Angels" film, so perhaps you have already seen the "Dread Angel", or maybe you saw "Angel". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked "The Invisible Ray" in the "Leeroy"-film, and thought it was a real story about a scientist.  I'm not sure if this one was better than the "La Llorona"-film. The story is about a woman who comes from the United States. In Mexico she's given a task to go to the United State. She and her son are to go with a family member (her mother) to see her son in the United Sates. My guess is that it's a Mexican film and her story would be the same, although I didn't see a film of hers for about a year and a half, so I can't say much about what her life was like. She didn't have the right character for her to be a mother. She doesn't have enough understanding to understand how Mexican-Americans would react to her son's situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have read the book you probably have an idea of how this movie will end. The movie is still one of the few horror movies where you can have an ending that has something positive in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm the same guy who bought the movie from "B" at the video store. This is the movie I saw. There are some decent actors in it and some good story lines that didn't end up being touched.  The only thing about it is, if you want to see the movie for yourself to find out what's actually going on there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has been released to the film festivals in the US, and I was curious if people were mad at me for "losing" to a small movie like this.  I did get the pleasure of seeing this film at the London Film Festival in 2003, which I liked a lot - when it came out.  Now, there's something that is missing. You see, it's only available in DVD format, which you have to get yourself, and you can't get it directly from the US distribution company, which is odd considering the fact that the film was released to DVD in the UK, which was the only country where it could have been released in, as far as I can tell. It may be the case that the distributor here had a distribution deal that included the US.  Perhaps there is a reason I missed this. It's really the only reason. What's more is that I can't find it in the comments on IMDb about the film - what do you think, is it not in there?  I'll be honest. I have not made up my mind about the director at all, and there is not enough information on IMDB or anywhere else to tell you whether or not this is a film I could recommend, and probably one that I'd even be able to recommend it to someone with the time and energy to watch and get through it. I recommend this to anyone who has an interest in documentary films or movies that you can give a chance to find something interesting in.but not to anyone for a full hour. It starts off with a lovely scene that focuses on an elderly woman who is being treated for cancer, which we get to see in the movie on the DVD, and ends with what looks like a man who was being treated with a similar disease (I know they were both in hospital for about an hour and a half), and there's a scene in it that could be considered "art" - I couldn't see it, and it's really, really stupid. This movie has really made a bad film of itself, in the end, not even making a decent film with such a low budget. The production of the film has a low-budget feel to it, with lots of bad CGI, badly lit scenes, bad sound, and bad camera-work - and I don't really understand how any of this has been filmed. It doesn't look like a documentary, and doesn't really try to be.  A really,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think anyone will really get to understand the movie and as I say, the man behind the curtain of the film, or what is left of the man. If I had been a fan of the movie, the film would have been released in 1998. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad that my movie was free of all commercialism. I believe that the majority of my peers' peers' fellow peers' counterparts' peers would be in for the same ordeal, if they watched this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how to write or how to present myself in the movie. I was in the theater and this movie was the final act of the movie, it was all done by the end of the year for the film industry. This was a major mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that is made on the premise that "if we were lucky" or "if our parents were right". We may live in the same community, and we may spend the same night as friends.  I would highly encourage you to take the time to read the book, to get acquainted with the characters, to learn what motivates them to do something but instead, this movie tries to be about the lives of the "good" people of the book (Mary Magdalene and Joseph Smith) and the lives and lives of people who don't exist. This movie is about Mary and Joseph and Joseph's sisters and sisters-the martyrs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has been around for a long time, and although it was not the first version, it was the one that was directed by the man in the white hat, and the guy who directed this one did not know that the movie was not in color, and didn't even know that there was a version out there for him to review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really tired of it, I think it's time for the movie to be made. If I had to do this movie again, I'd probably choose "The Devil Inside" and "The Mummy" for this movie. "The Curse" is a really bad horror movie, and I found the movie itself really strange and ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is terrible, I don't understand why I bothered watching it, it was so stupid and illogical, and I have seen some of the worst of crappy films.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. I couldn't even get one scene that was supposed to be funny.  I would strongly advise anyone with children to see this movie because it's really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Myself and a couple of other friends wanted to go out and see a movie that night.  I have seen so many movies in the last 20 years, including "The Sixth Sense," "The Ring," "Night on Earth," "A Christmas Story," "Dance with the Stars," "An American Werewolf in London," "Finding Nemo," "Coraline," "Winnie the Pooh," "Brave New World," and a whole bunch of others. I am sure these people were friends with the people on this list, so they are friends with this movie. We just don't have the same understanding about what's going on, and this film was never given a chance to prove its worth. In fact, this was the film that would be reviewed here at the B & I in the beginning. The reason we are here is because this movie was being made on the back of a credit card and not on the front. A lot of the reviews here, including the ones at "Hollywood Reporter," were written by people that read this review and were very positive about it. I thought that they would be more understanding and honest, just so you know. In the interest of fairness, we don't even get to see the ending of this film, as the end credits were never released, and it is the only movie that was released on DVD and VHS, so I wouldn't really consider this a horror film anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a man named Jack Stone (Jack Stone is the guy who made the movie).  It is about two guys (one is an actor) who have to go into a big house in the big town where Jack Stone lives. Jack Stone is a character who had his own movie, and the movie was not about him or his life. I don't know if he had nothing to do with this movie because that might be what made me want to see the movie. I found Jack Stone's character pretty annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was released in 1979 and it's really not that difficult to understand. This is one of the more "serious" movies in the whole world, but it was produced in a very short amount of time, which means that they were forced to rely more on their budget than on their creative talent and that's what they got.  The movie had a great cast of young actors who were up for the challenge and tried their best to make a good movie for the fans who have stuck with the movie for over twenty years and enjoyed it, but unfortunately the budget and time made this film the worst of all "retro" versions of the "Dr. Seuss" books and it is a shame they did such a low budget "retooling" of the original "Duck Dodgers" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing in it that has anything to do with movies is the trailer. The movie is bad, bad, and bad. It is absolutely awful. What happened to the "special effects" from the 70's and 80's that were so amazing? What happened. What did they do this time? I can't recommend it, it's awful.  The story isn't even funny. The actors' voices are terrible and the characters are weak. It's absolutely painful and awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In order for a sequel to the original "Die Hard" to make sense, I think the movie would have been best to focus more on the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can remember what the story was before. It had its good moments and when the story comes right, it will be good, as I am one of the fans of the original series.  I was a huge fan of the television show and was very sad when the show ended, so I had hope that it would come back on TV, which is why I was really looking forward to the next season of "Battlestar Galactica".  I found out about "Galactica" through an online movie. So I knew the film was going to be a re-make of the TV show, and I have to say that I did not like the look of the new "Galactic Rangers" uniforms for the first 2 episodes and I was hoping that they would look something different.  To begin with, I think that the new Rangers are just more uniformed soldiers than the "Galaxy Rangers" did, and thus, more like the troops of the Galactic Navy. The characters on the other hand, are all different characters, but with the same uniform. This looks to be an insult to the actors, who should just change the uniforms and then get their paychecks back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are not a fan of horror (it's a really bad movie), watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie is not a movie unless the actors put in an effort. And this movie is an insult to anyone. My favorite actor is Don Adams, whose portrayal of Wyatt Earp was not that bad, and he was an excellent actor, so I will remember him for his portrayal of Earp and the other two. Don is the best. It is a shame he was playing this role because when I saw the movie I was in the studio with Don, so that is the actor's best friend. So if you are interested, go see him in his role. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with one of the lead characters (I'm assuming that's what you would think, it's not one of our leads). The lead is not in the movie anymore (in fact he never even came to the studio). The film is a comedy, so how I'm supposed to get offended by a film called The Film Club with a title like this? My guess would be that they thought that "The Film Club" was the "real" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see why the makers and their friends did not want to "rock" their little movie, since rock stars like to rock and rock bands like to go out to the music (not just on stage). After watching this movie, if I had been Rock 'N' Roll, I would have been very angry with the makers.  I saw some very interesting and interesting scenes on screen, and it looked like some pretty good actors were working on the story. The film was actually pretty interesting. There were scenes in the movie where I thought the main character was a guy who was going through a bad phase in life and/or was going to become a rock musician, or he was going into a rock-n-roll phase (that's really how he got interested in a rock band, which is also where the main song "Wanted" was set) and this would have helped the film to tell what it is about. I thought there were some scenes where the guy was trying to come to terms with and work out a new stage sound.   A few scenes were shot in the rock-star town of San Francisco and then the scenes were later edited in a town where the band would be rehearsing for its performance (it doesn't have a town called San Francisco, but I would call it the San Francisco town). These scenes looked like they were going through the "Wish You Were Here" stage of the film, and the characters had some really good insight into the world of rock. In the scene where the lead singer was playing an old beat-up guitar and talking about how he was trying out different chords with his new guitar, he was talking about an old movie where he was learning the chords, and in that scene, he would have told us about the chord progression from Rock 'n' Roll history, which the movie never did. The scene is so bizarre, so out of character, so very unbelievable and so unbelievable.  The movie does not make sense, the whole thing. And I haven't really been a huge fan of the documentary feature, although it was about a documentary style and trying to cover all the subjects of the world, I didn't really like how they covered everything. This is a movie with real story elements and if you were to have the film as a documentary, it would not be that bad, but there are so many false scenes, so many bad scenes, and they really need to make some sort of effort to tell the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I came to see this was to see "The Mother". I really don't see the reason to see any other movie of any kind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie to be very confusing.  This film has already been rated with an R rating. It is not just a low budget, low budget flick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For all of you who have a real passion for the subject, this film is absolutely terrible.  It's about as close to an academic work as you can get and, I mean, the man is a total nut. It's all he's interested in, is his ego, which in any respect, is not the subject or subject of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film with a couple of friends. I was pretty bored after a few minutes of it.  I don't understand why this is a film in the B list. If it wasn't for the fact that it's on the B site, I would give this film a 1/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was directed by the award winning director of "THE FIVE HOUSES," whose son was killed on the streets of Baltimore, and she was the one who chose who should star in this movie.  It's not the first time this happens. As I write this, I have a couple of movies, "WHY THE BLOODY" and "The Dead Man" and I'm sure they were all pretty damn close to this.   I've been a fan of "The Five Houses" for nearly 25 years. The one thing that bothered me about "THE 5 HOUS" is that the film was on a double bill with the original. In "WHOSE HAPPY IS THE DEAD MAN," that's still an option and I don't think that "WHATEVER BECOMES OF US" would be available to rent in the spring of 1976, when "THE BLOODLESS MOVIE" was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To begin with, this film is a horror anthology. It was made in order to attract moviegoers who have a taste for such things. If you're a horror fan, you're already familiar with the "A" category of the film. And you already know how to look at the movie-titles that were printed at the end of the last film.  And you're familiar with how to watch this film-that of "The Horror Film", which means it's supposed to be about the horror genre (just like it was the last time) because I just saw the first one, so I can't really make my case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Movie" is about a young, un-proven writer/director who goes by the name "Jim Morrison" and is the subject of a very "tentative" movie that is actually about the "movie itself" being made.  The man-made movie is actually being made right now and is being called "Jim's Movie" and in the very near future. This movie is being made about "Jim" and he, his wife, his best friend, his manager and his manager's "assistant" (if you can call it that). The Man-made "movie" is being turned into a movie called "The Jim Morrison Story."  I understand that Jim Morrison has always been a very private man and doesn't want this sort of exposure to his public persona (which is why he was so adamant about "The Story"). I understand there are very small parts of "The Man-Made Movie" in it and the "Man-Made Story" will probably never be as good as "The Book".  You can't really compare a Man-In-The-Moon to a Man who is trying to get his mind right (or who is an actual "Man") with a Man in the "film", I believe. This is not a film that was made for movie-goers, film critics or any of the "critics." It's not really intended to make anyone enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched the first movie. When the director was making this movie, he and his girlfriend, were having dinner with her. It's really not the kind of film that I'd recommend people watch at a night time in a bar with my girlfriend and her friend (I'd have to think that they would be just fine watching it with me). The acting is terrible, it's laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, if you are an independent film director you don't get to write a negative reviews. That is just something you have to deal with. I wanted to go out of town to visit the little film festival in California that would be coming up soon and get to work with my colleagues. I saw the film at the festival which was just amazing and I thought it was going to make an impact at the little local film festival, but I saw how it was written, the bad, sad ending really was it. If you see this film it could make you laugh, it could even make you cry. We should be able to laugh and to feel good about the film, but instead you should go see the little festival in the small town I saw it. I hope that you really, really like itbut this little film was a waste of my time. It is an insult to the film and a waste to the little town where it was filmed, the little girl was lovely, she really should have been a part of the little village film. I am sorry for any people that really love the little villagers of the tiny village, you'll get to see them in the movie later. The little girl should be sent to a small island in the Pacific Ocean, it was so good, I would love to make this a real movie and make this film for the little guy, his character is so very, very adorable, and he deserved a beautiful little girl.  The rest of the cast is just really terrible and it's so bad that it's just bad. The ending is just so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a real disappointment.  I recommend this movie to be the kind of movie that you'll see at an after-party, or something that you enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what it was like when the original, I thought I was going to see another kind of movie (a comedy). If you know me, you know that I like a good laugh, that's what this movie really wasn't.  I won't recommend this movie to the family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, like many others, was completely uncensored, which is a bad idea. The film begins with a girl having sex with a guy, and we get our first clue that there might be some nudity--the guy is covered with a towel, which goes along with the first scene of the film--so we begin to learn that not only is this film rated R18, it is uncut, or at least unrated, so there will be no more nudity and no less sex than usual--at least not at the beginning. Some may find this film entertaining, and there is a good chance that it would be rated at R, in France and Belgium. There are some scenes in the film that were shot in front of the camera at night, which would be shot with a camera lens covering up the naked person or the breasts and are, in this case, shot from behind the camera so as to not disturb the woman who is actually having sex or show her breasts as they are (because, like, there would be some kind of censorship or something). (This movie is not shot in the same way that most B-movies are shot, so the film is more like a horror flick, and you have to look for that genre--but there are a few scenes shot in Paris and, I guess, some in the woods).  You will not find anything that you can see in this film. It's a weird little film--and it's kind of funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For anyone familiar with the show, this film was like watching it from 2001. It had an incredibly poor acting and horrible dialogue.  I thought I was watching some kind of a comedy. This isn't a comedy, just a disaster.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The DVD release contains a 20 minute piece called "Viking Odyssey", which is a very well done documentary. My friend did a very good job with it, and I have my own DVD release of it as well. But the real issue for me was, the lack of the Viking battle scenes, which were pretty obvious. When I looked at the original DVD, I didn't really notice it. When the special features on the original release were on DVD, they were full length battle scenes of the Vikings going into battle, or on the battle ships, or at the end of the battle, and they were in the battle scenes. My guess is that the DVD has the most recent scenes from the battle of Hastings, and perhaps they were used as a "canned" scene, that would be the case. (Vikings did not have the kind of a bad run in the battles that they had with the Anglo Saxons!) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about the aftermath of the end of the world, that the end is close to them...and a lot of the time the story is very simple and lacks a lot in the background and action...the end of world is close and the end to this world is far, not in the middle of the woods, that is why I was hesitant to view this film, I really wanted to see a really cool, action-packed zombie flick, this is what they call "The Thing."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To say that this movie was made with some good intent is that it did have the same directors as other "bad" movies. I found it was the same old material. The only thing that really kept this movie afloat was its excellent music, which should have been released in the fall of 2001 on some of the video labels. We're lucky to have this video out to the world, because I can't believe we would have been able to complete the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fairly big film buff and have seen the majority of Hollywood films, and I had expected to see the film at the Ritz-Carlton level, because of the name and the fact that the film had the tag-line "The Biggest Film Of All Time", which would of course be my biggest film to date. I actually saw this film in the U.K., where it was released as "The Blue Planet", and it was about an hour and a half longer than the original "Blue Planet" version. I had seen the first version of the film, which was only about 3 hours long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two main reasons. One is that some people find it very hard to watch, and some people simply have never made a movie before, and two, I thought that they could use this as a sort of experiment to see how people respond to a movie about their personal lives, because the whole point of this is to try and show what it would be like to be a couple of teenagers, and perhaps to show some of the things they might do, and this was more about showing my friends and family.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised to find that the other review, on IMDb, and others, didn't criticize this film the way it did on IMDB. Maybe it's a coincidence. It is also an odd movie for me. I liked the first and second part, where the characters were introduced, and the characters and their motivations in the second movie. With this film, it has a more serious tone than the first two movies, but it is still not the kind of film where we are supposed to laugh or be silly or anything like that.  This movie is really bad for all of the actors involved. They all are terrible. I find it hard to believe this movie will ever make it to the silver screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was this guy, with his wife and kid, and that was the one time. The rest of the time, it's just the couple, who go through all kinds of things in their lives. They go through a lot of tears, but the thing I don't get, when I'm talking to them, is why they don't just say "oh, we cried," or, when the person on the other side of the phone tells me to, "You guys didn't cry during that movie,"  They get emotional, they cry. So that's the thing that they get emotional about, when they are upset, in which they get sad. I mean, that's what's happening, and I think I'm supposed to get to know that. There's the emotional stuff on their face that they're wearing, the things that they say and the way that they talk, as opposed to just how they are doing it on the screen.butbutbutBUTbutbutthe movie is very short. There are three endings in the movie. This has a story that could have lasted an hour or two, which is too short. It's a pretty horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really know what to expect. I've never seen anyone play a major part in one of those movies.  This is why I decided to see it. It's a "classic" so to speak, which makes me think that I might be getting something worthwhile. Ibut don't hold my hopes. The film is just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this is a very bad movie, because I think it is a terrible movie. The movie starts with two men, and then cuts to a few men, or vice versa.  My favorite part of the movie is when they take a stroll through the movie and get their hair and makeup done, and when they are in the "new" house.  It was like when I used to see it on TV, as an actual family film. The actors who played the two main characters, David Duchovney and Robert Culp, I had the pleasure of knowing that they were good actors, so I'm surprised that they decided to work with this guy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's bad, but the bad part doesn't make the movie bad. The film itself isn't good and I didn't like how they made a big deal about the film's "post-college" nature. The acting, the direction, the "feel" of this film is all over the place and I have no idea why they called it an independent film when the entire thing is a "film" in New York, it is a film about 20,000 feet up. I had no idea how I would get out of bed when I sat down to watch this film. I really wanted to like this film because I'm a huge fan of John Leguizamo's "LAST CALL", who directed the two other movies, "THE BENDER" and "SINATRA" and I would have definitely considered this film to be the "best of John Carpenter's movies". I would love to see the other two "CIRCLE OF CONCEPCIONES" films, especially since they were filmed and edited in Los Angeles, and I really want to know how it is going to be like this one. I also found myself wanting to see more of the other cast members because the "good guys" seemed to be running things, too. It's a very strange film, which is not only about this story, and if you are into "CINEMA CLASSICS".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been interested in this project for a long time, since I started reading the book. I've seen this film before, and watched it with the original cast.   When I was in the theater, I was watching a small group of people who had attended the screening of "Oasis: The Sundance Film". They were all the best, and were in the audience when the film came out. If you had ever been in a theater, you would have had a hard time missing them.  So if you were one of them, you wouldn't have a hard day's work. That, in itself, is good, considering that "Oblivion" was an experimental project. "Omni" is just a big-budget remake of an already-made film.  I think the film is still the best of the original, but it's just that it is now over 15 years old, which is way too old to be shown on the cover of a film (or anywhere else). It's not like it was released on VHS in the 80s, and it's not that we can buy this film on DVD either.  And the thing about this is that it has already been remade with the new "Ovum" "Odyssey" label. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first film, I remember it was very good. If you want to see the first few minutes, here's a trailer for the first 20 minutes, and it has a few seconds of the first 40 minutes. I know this is a fairly small independent film. I didn't really know much about this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was made to be the "film of the month" which is the way it was made and distributed to the world.  I was a major fan of the first "Hannibal" film and liked this film because it was a completely different movie. There was nothing in the first film that would give me pause to call it a horror film; the "Hanni" trilogy is totally unrelated to the "The Cannibal". If you are interested in seeing this movie, buy it on VHS, DVD, or a copy of it on the IMDb; this is just the first in what will hopefully be a "mini" series of films. And even if you are an avid fan, you'll need to be willing to suspend your disbelief because the film doesn't really make the case as to why the characters are cannibals or why they were doing what they did. The first film has a much more fleshed out character who is seen doing something very bad in the cannibal film. The character is very unlikable. It has nothing to do with the cannibal character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing a lot of good reviews on IMDB, I was looking for anything to say that this movie would be an independent film like a "Saw" type film.  I don't know if there are still other independent filmmakers out there who have seen this film. At least one of them will want to write and show their opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last time the series was on the air I think it ran on CBS, so I guess they had an idea of what they wanted.  This show was released on the FOX network.  That is my take. I remember from watching "Tigerland" that when the original series was aired on CBS I remember that they released it on Saturday Night Live. The first show was on Saturday night, after all. I believe it was only about 90 minutes long. This show ran for over 2 hours and 20 minutes.  I have been a part of a lot of sitcoms, I don't remember one with shows this long. I guess it could be because this show is from the 70's, or because they did not want to have any sort of a "show-off". My guess is they had enough "B" projects already on the schedule. I personally do not think this is what "T.J. Hooker" would call a "good" show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a very terrible movie, all the characters were terrible and just horrible, it was terrible and there was a huge gap of time for this movie to be made. And I cannot imagine it being made for any profit to be seen as a movie at all. It was a terrible, horrible movie, absolutely horrible, with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever, and completely out of the realm of being entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original movie was so exciting. It was a young man and had never left the United States. If I didn't have a wife and a family to go to school with, my kids would have been excited to see that movie.   So it was a shock to everyone that the original, much younger, and less exciting sequel made it on the big screen.  I can't fault the fact that a lot of people think this is the only way to make the movie, as they've never really been around the movie. In a real sense, it's about the same level of interest as the original movie.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetthe actors are not good, or maybe they are not experienced enough, or perhaps they're old.  What is happening to me on the screen is either someone who can act in a very low budget, or someone who is not getting any help, or is being given a script that's totally unrelated to what the characters are supposed to be. What I was seeing was an almost completely disjointed movie, almost like it was made of paper.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts out with a very funny and upbeat plot and some good funny characters. I was hoping for more, and to find out if it was the first two movies.  The only thing I can comment on is that the first movie is about two guys (Takashi Miike and Ryu Takahata), and Takashi's character in this movie is very smart and very sensitive. I'd really like to see him in some more comedy/humor movie. Also, the movie is the first in Japan, so some of the things we find are the language barrier with Takashi Miikes (English).  Also, Takashi in a comedy/comedy should be playing with a group of people and having to communicate with them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What could be considered an honest evaluation would be that movie was made in 1999, the year the movie was released. It was made with the hopes of it being made in 2001. The actors, actresses, sound technicians, sound, camera, lighting, camera angles were all made from scratch. The "professional" look they came up with for the film was a very poor attempt.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As one person has already stated, I found myself in the same situation as in my college physics classes, just as a physics student, not a filmmaker. I tried to explain to a few of the friends who wanted to see it that I would make it into a movie, and I thought that would work. I thought the movie would be something really dramatic and that it would be the reason to rent it. The movie is very heavy, slow-moving and so, so cheesy.   I would rather waste an hour and a half on the movie than see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like one of those TV-movie sequels... The only thing different was the bad guy wearing a mask.  The worst part about this film is the ending, it has a lot of bad people. I was really looking forward to watching this movie to see how the "perfect ending" would come out. After seeing the end of this movie, I will not watch it again. There is nothing here to be a "perfect" ending... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made to have a very very big hit on the home video market, and while the actors are pretty good, I am just tired of this crap. The movie isn't funny, the acting isn't even remotely good, and the ending has really nothing to recommend this movie... it isn't that bad of a movie.  I'm not going to write a review of every terrible movie that exists, just like every other horrible movie ever... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with two children in a field. The first part is about the search for their mother.  The story that I found in this film was very poor. There is little or no closure at the end. And the movie is really only interesting for the kids to look at the movie theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not even going to talk about the actors who were good at that kind of role because they were good actors. They had a chance to be a part of the film because the director gave me some kind of an idea of what the film was going to be. And that's exactly what the filmmaker gave me. Because I don't think there was a single good reason for this film, at least that I've seen in this movie. I'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10 from "10 for good movies" rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't have much faith in this movie, I think it's really good for the kids, but I didn.  I wasn't really sold on this movie because it didn't come to my apartment. My roommate (and friend) who lives in the same building (another guy who is also a resident of that building) was interested in this, because they wanted to do a film with me and this is a real film, it was the same one that I rented. There is an entire lot of character there, so there's nothing to worry about with the lack of my apartment being rent for a few weeks. My biggest concern, which I hope it's not too distracting to someone who saw this movie first, was a potential for this movie being released in Japan or America and that it would be a really good film that would make me fall in love and buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had a really good story about what would have been called The Great Spirit.  A big problem was, was, is that in America, the Great Spirit is the national holiday. And in the original film, a lot of the footage of this film was shot in the summer months. In my country, the holiday is held in the winter, and the original story had it right. This film doesn't include much footage of the Great Tree of Peace in the snow and it's not the Great Peace, which means people are still out there and doing something for our Heavenly Father. A day like this would be better served to shoot the film in the fall. As for the Great War, I'm not sure what they would call that, but I don't have my own opinion on the matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In "The Naked Gun" movie, I didn't have any problem with it. I thought that it was at least a good way to get out of town with my brother and sister-in law who are not used to seeing nudity, since they hadn't seen it before. I think it's because the "Naked Gun" had so many actors in it, and the "The Deerslayer" film is so very small, that I was pretty shocked when I actually saw it, so I was actually thinking the same thing about it. So I gave this one a 9 out of 10 for the nudity on the "Deerslayer". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't believe they went to the University of Iowa, that I attended. I went to Iowa. I wanted to see the University in Iowa.  That is the point of going to Iowa, and they should not have given me that point, to be honest with you.  I'm not one of those people who gets angry about it because there was not enough film on it, or because there wasn't an opportunity for people to know the truth, or that I'm too sensitive to have them make the film.  To make the point clearer, and to see what was actually shown in the film, is the University. It's been said, in their defense, that this is the best, and I believe it was, and that is what I saw.but not necessarily because it's a great film (I've seen the worst of the worst).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen this movie in ten years, and it came out for DVD, I thought I would get to see a little bit of the past. I have seen a lot of the best-of-the-late "Hobbit" movies, which were made before. I was not at all surprised by the ending. If you are expecting a film about Tolkien's life, you are very lucky. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really care what was going to happen, I was pretty sure it was going be a pretty good film. I don't think it was the best movie, nor was it bad. I just couldn't get into it was all over. It had a pretty bad end and it was good at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I am not a fan of "Dressed To Kill", it's not as awful as it's been portrayed to be, and it will probably not get the movie made on DVD, which is why I am writing this, in hopes of the best. If that doesn't work, I'll be doing the whole thing on videotape and/or for a "film festival" or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a fan of the great horror/thriller writers (Brenner, Schulman, Salk, Cronenberg, etc.) then you will understand this film is just too predictable. It's difficult to understand the motivations of a killer with a simple motive. I would recommend that you sit down with a good friend (if you do not have a bad one) and watch this film with them, and have them talk about it at length.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to review the rest of the film as there are only a few pages, or I'm just going to say I'm a man who watches movies and read about movies, and I don't want to do that. I'll say that I went to a great movie, The Departed, and that movie left the screen with about 30 minutes left in the film. The Departure left 30 minutes and that's not for me to compare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first two films were just a documentary about the life of an ex-cop, and even though they were both good, it was a great documentary of the life and death of an cop, so this time I'm not interested in the life-changing power of this film, so I'm a fan of the first two movies and will keep watching them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been one to watching films with the intention of a horror-comedy. This is a comedy.  You know, you don't get to go to a theater and see the ending of a comedy, and you know it's not the end of your life when you die, and that means I was right to feel this film is not a very funny comedy. The director should have gone in with this intention. And there's really no reason whatsoever to make a comedy out of a serious movie, unless you're really, really serious, in a movie that really takes itself seriously. As it's hard to believe this was one of the last films they ever made, not even the closing credits are worth this, with such serious subject matter (a comedy in a comedy) being made into a comedy with such low comedy-humor material, by such an interestingbutbutbutBUTbutbut-butbut movie withbutbutyetbutbutbutt ending.  The funniest way this movie was to watch was with people who had something serious to talk about, like the movie is about, which is about the end, which isn't terribly depressing, at least in the first 20 minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Man in Black" is the best of the "Lord of the Rings" movies--that's who you're supposed to see. The others, in this film, are more like they're trying to be more like the "Man in Black", which seems like a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we went to see this movie back in 2000, I thought that this was an adult film. And since this was the only film on this DVD, that meant that I thought this was a fairly adult film as well. I found out when I saw this movie that it is about 10 years old, and it is still not completely finished. In fact, if I had to make a movie of this, I would probably make a new film, with a complete remake of the movie with the actors of all the actors in their prime and the production values be as high as possible, but even so, this is not going to be as good as an adult feature film, since it lacks a great deal of acting talent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friends and I were out together, and had a couple of beers before the movie, and my friends were a bit more drunk, so it was just after the movies began. This is one of those "film flicks". The director is one-half of a comedy troupe called "Funnymen" which has a fairly large following, so that is who I'm talking about. This isn't funny. It's boring, predictable, and doesn't even manage to capture the essence of what funny-funny is. As a comedy, this is a movie which is not funny enough to be released on video.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I would like to point out that I am in the US.  I am not really familiar with this kind of thing, although I do know that there are many people who were killed in this thing, and there is nothing like this movie to make one sick.    This movie is about a man who, after the end of his life, has this weird hallucination of all kinds of people.  This may be the only film that I have seen that has a hallucination out of left and right that is so bad.  The acting is bad, and is completely unrealistic. One of the most ridiculous things is the woman who goes into the bar, and then comes back out of the bar with a wig and a bathing suit. And the idea that he goes into a bar, that the bartender is so amazed by his acting, is ridiculous. There is no way that the girl should be doing any kind of sexual contact with him. He is completely inept and completely ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean you have to understand, we were very young. We didn't have any of the wisdom, or experience that you might need from a film like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about a group of 15 or so friends and is supposedly about a "realistic" story about a young girl named Roxy.  I've seen other movies about young girls and even movies in France. You'll find one here.  The movie begins with the "hero" character Roxy's father, Mr. LeGrand (who appears to be a rather famous person), talking about his son's death. Mr. Caine is the only real person involved in this film and that character appears to have some great insight into the real-life circumstances. I am looking forward to learning more about this character in the next movie, "Roxy", which is actually the same guy who appears in this one. In this movie, Mr LeGrand is a regular guy, so he can't really help Roxy in the way that he would help her father or, for that matter, anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't fathom why this film was made or that the directors of it were. The film was shot by the crew of the movie The Last House with the director of this film directing. It has been over a week since I saw this film. The movie starts with a group of friends getting together after a party in a house where their friend died at the end of the last movie (The last House), which was in a very different area of the country from where this movie is shot in the outskirts of Chicago and is a very strange film. It's just terrible, it's not even funny, and it needs to be stopped at this point. It is ridiculous and horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the movie was first released, I was one of the biggest fans of the film. I thought it was about my beloved and the director wanted to take it seriously, I believe it was because they were trying to capture the essence of the movie, not just a film about the real life of the real person. I believe the movie had its moments, like when one of my favorite and real friends of the director, James Coburn was being interviewed for his life, and the interviews that James did on the late Joan Rivers, as he was in his prime at the time, were very interesting.   If I remember correctly, Coburn had this film under contract with ABC, and if you are a viewer, you know that ABC was very aggressive in trying to re-buy the film in the late 80's and early 90's. In one interview, Joan Rivers was trying to break the contract, and ABC had Coburn on camera. Joan was asking him questions about Rivers' early life, which is a fairly common question for her now, when he was younger and in a bad condition, and Coburn did an interview with Rivers. Joan's interview with Coburn started off by discussing Rivers' illness, her health, and her illness in the early days of her career with the New York Times, and in the film, it continues through the end of their interview, and that is where Coburn's illness comes up, and how it was with Joan. The first time, Joan talks about Rivers and her first contract with New York and New York TV, and then later in the movie Coburn asks her what she thinks about the contract situation. Joan mentions that it was bad because of the money, and he states, as she did previously, that she had a much better contract for ABC and CBS, and she says to him, "But I'm not sick anymore, so I don't know." She's very ill now, and not just ill, but severely ill, as the producers of the show decided that they wanted to replace Coburn, because I don?t think they saw anything in Coburn but a really sick man.  They thought they would make me sick by putting a bunch of drugs in my coffee, and putting me on a lot of medications that would make a sick person sicker, they would have made a sick man sicker. I think that was the idea, and I really don't think they got away with that. So, if you

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's pretty safe to say that it's one of the "good" movie groups. Some of my friends have already seen it and I think they're not too fussy or picky or something like that. And that's pretty much the gist of it. I'm guessing that the movie will probably have some sort of movie-making school curriculum behind it, and that's what you'd expect from a "director's" degree or something, right? I'm going to give this movie about a 10/10 for actingbutbutbutthenbecausebutbecause thebutbecauseitbutbecausebecauseit's butbutbutbecause they're in film school.butbecause there is some real lack of a director and/or co-writer or writer-type character for about the first ten minutes of the film, there's a kid running around, looking at a computer screen in a little bit of a movie-shop-store-like place, in a blue-and-white t-shirt. (I thought I'd be in the same kind of place I was in the last movie when we first met him, I think I was wearing blue and white.)  This is because it's the type of movie where they're trying to create something to a very short script and very basic, sort of "film" subject matter, and this is when they'd like to keep it as simple and to "film-ish", right? Of course, I would love to see a movie where we're just standing there, not running around with a laptop, or some kind of kid version of a "movie-shop", because that would make it all the better!  That said, there are two characters who we have met in movies, and they're kind of like this kid's brothers, so there's really nothing "filmish" about them at the beginning. They're not bad, they're just kind of odd. And again, it's a movie that's about some kids, so they're sort of like characters who you might find in some kid's book, so I'm sure you've got a few of them in your minds. The whole "jazz singer" and "poet" thing, they do have some kind (or one of these) music and we do learn a bit about their lives and they get into some kind dialogue. There's one "junkie" scene and one "filmic" scene, both of which are in the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this is a film with the intention of making friends, it's a film about a family of four. And the same family that was with me and my family's friends to the end of the movie. They didn't show any of the families of other family members and family friends of mine at the end. I'm sure it's an attempt to create a family portrait piece. It's not just a movie, and this hurts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It all begins with a very interesting discussion of the history and culture of the area. It is a shame I didn't read the entire piece (and if I did it would be in my research for the movie) about the actual events, because I did some research in the area for "The Bible" series and for other research related to the book series and "The New Testament" series. A bit of the historical research is interesting, because "The Book of Mormon" series had some of these same issues, in terms of the "Bible" series' history and geography.  This movie is just an insult to all people involved with it, including myself. If this is the last movie that was supposed to be made, I'm surprised they did it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to the movie (the first one, that's an hour and forty minutes long) in the beginning and getting all excited about it being about how it will help the homeless and stuff. I'd probably just sit back and watch it's first hour and then see if it's just one movie for a good few weeks in theater. The director, himself, says that he won't be able to give his credit card away to the film if it doesn't get a PG rating.  The guy with the beard is the same guy who wrote and directed the first "Dead Man Walking" film. There's also a man with the mustache who's writing this one. He has been writing for this movie for nearly three years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to watch the movie because it was a "love story" movie (which is why I watched it), and have been spoiled by this film. It is a terrible, terrible, horrible, horrible movie that doesn't fit for anyone to even sit down, and even if you were to sit in it, and say that there are some good reviews, don't even think about sitting in that seat. It's like watching a play, or even like watching my kids watch it. It doesn't belong on TV. The only good thing about this movie, which is some of the comments on YouTube, is to see how the characters interact with each other.

I was actually very interested in it for the first 30 minutes. And I saw a preview for it the other day and was very excited about how far they had gotten. So this is an absolute waste of money. That has nothing to do with being a movie.

It is hard to understand how much money and effort it cost the American film industry to do this film. This is a film that cost over $1 million to make. It has been released in a few markets. For comparison, the new Superman Superman is being shown for less than $4 million dollars!  It is going to get released for every single market, and probably more.  I just don't think it is worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this I was like, wow, this is a movie with a lot of talent, but it is nothing compared to The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Sgt. Fusilli (which is a very interesting piece of art that has a lot to say, and the way it's presented in the film). To be honest, the film has the greatest story of them all, but some of the movie's production values are a little overdone. The end of the film is the last scene of Sgt. Rock's career, not the first. And of course, I think the Beatles were still getting used to their post-Beatles roles. They've got a whole lot of stuff going on, from their live performances, to interviews, to a whole host of different things. The film is just not up to the standard of a Beatles piece of work. The music is bad, the special effects are bad, and I don't think they deserve to be compared to the great, or at the very least, a top notch, Beatles film. The movie is a mess, and it is over an hour long.

It's a movie that is trying to be a high profile comedy, so that people who are interested in movies like "Gigli", or "The Big Chill" may have a chance of getting in on it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the story of a bunch of bad actors with no good plot. The plot is ridiculous. The characters are stupid. The movie is a movie with a silly tone. If you ever really want to get a message across to these people, watch it again, don't do it this time! This movie might be on video.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a "regular guy" since I was a teenager, and I have only read the books, not seen the film. The guy is supposed to be the regular guy, a regular guy with a family, a "family guy", he has a brother and sister, he is now a "young guy", and is the only guy who has a family and he's the one who knows about the family business. That's it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the DVD box set of this movie, and while I knew they would have to re-do a lot of the makeup and re-release it, I did not expect it to be that painful. In truth, it's hard to watch the movie. I have seen better movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't made in Hollywood; it's made in a back office in Vancouver (or New York City, or Hong Kong) in the Canadian capital of Vancouver. It's called "Movie" because it's being distributed on video cassette in Canada; that's the only way it's getting distributed here in the States, because it costs US$6.9 per minute of its 30 minute running time.   I am not really sure if it was made for Canadian audiences, or was it distributed in Canada, or who is in control of this production or what they plan to do with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For starters, the movie starts in New York, so it's an urban guy, not a hippie. Also, the director has never done a lot of documentary work, so I have some sympathy for his lack of experience.  I was intrigued by the idea of interviewing some of the most famous and respected figures in the world. I was really interested to see what he'd say about the nature of this film and the role of an independent documentary. I've always enjoyed independent documentaries that are looking at the everyday life of a person, in their own words, not using film-making techniques as a means to capture images, and I was very curious to hear what the director had to say. He was verybutbutbutBUTbutbutnotgood at his job. There is so much more to the story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would be difficult to find a good movie in the 90's, let alone in the 00's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main characters are played by the same actor for each film. I don't know if there is a second time for the same characters to try to "make" another film. The only thing that keeps me watching is the fact that it is a comedy. I am pretty sure it would be just as easy for this movie to be made in the span of one afternoon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with the premise that this movie is about "a real life" love story between a young man and a young woman. The boy is a good boy, and is a real student at a good public school and an honor roll student, who is a senior at this point in his life. I saw him on a talk show the week prior, and was surprised that he was in his sophomore year at school.  A second grade book, which was also in the book, was also available to me, and I read it as well.   In this movie, the boy's father is shown in the movie. The movie "B" was about a real life love story that was played out in the film, and it was an honor to be able to go into that, so I am hopeful about the next installment. This film isn't going to make any friends, and there isn't even much that can be said about the boy. I'm hoping that, if you are a parent and have read this movie with a little more knowledge than I, you get the message that my friends and I are still very much in touch and interested in his future, and that he can, in some way, change this, or make some small positive changes that will make him a little less bitter about his fate, and we hope that someone can take my advice and go back and review the movie with him, as we will all be watching it in hopes of finding that elusive "Aha moment" (a true movie for a real boy) with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest, I find this movie "funny" (and a good laugh is what this movie needs at times) since it is all about being drunk. The other side of the coin is that since it has a script, it is written like it has already been done. There are characters that are not very good, and it is about making a "movie". The characters are not as well developed as they are in "The Naked Gun" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and it just makes me think they were really drunk. This movie doesn't have a killer with a conscience.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the film because it was based on the "Lone Gunner" and had to fight the Japanese at the end of World War 2. I did the research for the Lone Gunner series and found out the actual facts regarding this movie and I found out that the Lone Ranger's friend, Sergeant Major Donaldson, was actually killed while trying to protect the town of San Francisco from Japanese forces during the siege in 1941.  This is the film's main character, played by Sean Young, and he is portrayed as a loner who was very lukewarm towards the police department and did not really want to work in the department.  It has been stated that the character is "crazy," I think that's what happens when you're a lunkie loner, not a "crazy loner," as Mr. Young was in the film. If Mr. John McClaine ever came to the town, he would see him with his trademark cowboy hat and would understand why he would look a little different in the town square.  I'm sure it wasn't his decision.   As a librarian, who is also an officer and not an instructor, I could see a "lunkie" librarian running around trying to figure out how to carry all those books. The other librarian would have no problem with him taking them, and I'm going to assume that Mr. McClaine would appreciate the fact that the librarian was librarian before he became a cop.  In the first episode of this series, I liked the idea of a lanky cowboy "Stonewall" who could carry books to help out a dying man. I could say that about the lunkies of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to go through the whole book, but I'm going to give you the short version. The movie was very "low-key", and it's not that difficult to make a low-key movie-- I'm just not sure if it was low-budget or if it had "a good enough reason" to be low-tech.  The movie has a good story-- about a man who meets a woman, and is forced to make some hard decisions by having to live with his wife and son. I think that if it were made into a movie with "the same circumstances" and "the people with the same circumstances", the movie would have been a great one, because of the relationship between Richard Chamberlain, the lead character and Peter Falk, but unfortunately, it seems like Falk had more influence on the movie, and was able to direct it.  This was one of Falk's movies-- he directed the film and then went into private studio and directed "The Good Soldier" and then he directed this one.  If Falk had not been involved in this one, it would be a very interesting film.    The only thing that I can really conclude is that they did this because of Falk, and I would like to keep Falk involved with it. I thought that Falk was great as a director, and in this movie I thought he could have worked with the script to make it better. This film is not a great film by any means. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am only going to watch this movie, so if anyone else comes across this film and decides to watch it, I suggest you watch this for the reasons I give.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my first exposure to any "B" movie (I actually just saw "C") and I remember that there was a lot more to that, and I was watching this "B", and I'm sure the others who saw this are like me - not even aware it was my movie, and it wasn't really shown very well, either. I thought it was about time for them to explain more about what a person's life was like, or why they made the film, and this was very "B." I think it was "B movie 101." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of this film, Jean-Luc Godard, is a very intelligent filmmaker, and it's interesting to see him in a film that didn't start out in France. It's interesting, like to see how French films were made. I'll take more of his ideas.  In this, there is no idea. If the film is the worst thing ever to be made, I wouldn't even waste one minute of my time. You don't want to see the first film with you family, just like with your daughter. You want to laugh, or to watch a comedy.  I'm sure there are some people out there who can't stand a French film, just as there are those who couldn't stand the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very happy with the performance of the first two episodes. I felt like it was a great way to present a small show on the campus of Wesleyan and the students would have laughed at the premise of this show. I would also be inclined to make the argument that the characters were still very human, or the students were in on the joke. The acting was pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen my share of bad horror movies, and I've really seen horror in all mediums.  My hope is that the producer of this movie is that he'll be like a bunch of other people and he'll just be trying to get me to see what's on the screen for me to look at. What amazes me is that this is so out of the blue, so unlike anything I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only positive review I could give was that, and I won't say anything bad about it. If it was a good movie, I'd be able to sit down and enjoy it. The whole idea behind this movie was that it would be a comedy. I was absolutely underwhelmed. I had no idea that the writer and director would put so much energy into this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found out of curiosity (that's all) and was hoping to find something that was an action film, as the other reviewer said, I would just like to point out that the action was pretty good in the previews, as it was just the action that was happening in the trailer that was being shown to us at the time that I found this movie on cable TV, as I could pick up the various commercials to watch. As well, as a result of this movie, I think that I am one of the worst actors that ever did a movie, ever, ever. I don't know why I ever did this movie. It's horrible. If you like the "Gremlins" films, you'd get a migraine from this one and a headache from it. The only good thing about it is that it has a pretty good story behind it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with the death of a young boy on the beach. It's not long before we're bombarded with a bunch of scenes that were shot in the same location, that we can't really say much about them, and they were done by the same people that wrote this. It turns out that the writer had nothing to do with this film, and that's just one film that's about 30 minutes long, since there were a lot more films that had nothing at all to do on this one, and the only good thing about it was the fact that it was a good first impression of the film, since they would make a good movie out of it, and then, as the reviews say, they will talk about this one (which I did, by writing the script and directing and editing it) before the opening credits have been aired. If you do not watch this film after a few weeks, you might be happy that it did not air on a Sunday. The credits would look very good, since it would be very, very funny and well done. They are not funny now, with the jokes about how the guy was trying to win, who is the writer's wife, and how he just got the movie, and about how it didn't sell at the theater, and are very low-rent, and a typical "one man show", I was never really into this film and I don't know why I even gave it the rating it had in the beginning, since that was a movie that had a lot of characters, and I'm sure there were some funny people in it, because I did like those kind of people, and this is pretty much what the same guy is playing in the last scene in this film that played a character who has never been shown, and you don't really know who is in it. He played a bad guy who has a "normal" job, he gets fired, he tries to win the lottery, he doesn't really like women, he is a weirdo with a brain problem and is very, VERY stupid. It just blows me away how bad he is at everything, he's got the brains of a 6 year old, so that is what makes this movie so dumb, it just goes on and on. The film isn't even good for entertainment value.  I just gave this movie its rating on the first night, and it was so good, so I expected to just like this film (because it's been
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself really getting angry about it. It had the whole feeling of having "all that extra" extra content that was just put in after a film has been completed. I don't know what it was that I was so angry about. I can't imagine how they could have put me in such a state of mind after the film, nor does it inspire anything whatsoever. I have only seen the movie once (by accident, and with the director's friend who really did a great job in the film) in an advance screening, and the film itself is very dull, and very hard to believe that this is the "masterpiece" of the directors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll have to watch it again, although it's a horror movie, not a comedy. I'm not a huge horror fan, although this movie has an interesting point, that the movie wasn't made in LA. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I'm going mad and I had read all the comments and all of the other comments from other reviewers before I went in, I'm very depressed and I feel like I'm having an asthma attack just like the movie, the only reason I've managed to finish this movie is because of the wonderful and beautiful people I know who did it.butbutbutBUTbutbutso,butbutbecause I'm being treated like a criminal. I don't know if it's legal or not and the judge in the courthouse knows nothing about this. The court ordered me to sign a paper of apology with no explanation for this, no explanation of why I have to be punished. It's as simple as that. The judge also says that I'm innocent, well, as innocent as you can be accused of being for being an adult, because of a stupid decision made by the State. It is a criminal offense for this to be put out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First let me say that I love most of the actors and actors in the play. The play was the first thing I ever saw and I love it!  I think it's really good, I think.  There was a play about this exact play in England just over the last year.  And, in general there are some good plays in other plays and plays by the likes of Christopher Plummer, William Shakespeare, Henry V.   Also, as I've mentioned before, this play doesn't have the right director.  I don't know exactly what this is about, but for me this is really a very bad play. And, it's bad not only because of the poor screenplay, but also because of how it's supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To begin with, I'm a die hard Hollywood fan, I know a lot of actors, I've directed tons of Hollywood films. In fact, if you've seen the last film you know what I'm about. The director is known as a man who knows how to tell good stories in other genres, so to speak. And I feel very sure that by the time this film comes out, it will have the most solid and well directed review on IMDb, but then again, when you go into the film with this low grade (which I feel was the case) I was very very disappointed with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't remember when I last saw this film, but if I recall, it was at least a PG-13 movie (probably). The most recent film "Dune" was rated PG and also had more blood. I don't remember having seen a PG film since college or high school, so I don"t know if they have changed their rating system in the meantime. I guess they did give "Dark" a PG rating, which is a PG sequel, but the Dune sequel is the biggest film that it has ever been, so it seemed logical that they would have gone out of their way to make a film about a more familiar subject to people, since it"s an old movie. The director did come to Los Angeles to make this film after the first one, so that should be a positive sign, because he did spend some time with this film as an intern at Paramount, and that might help clarify some of his decisions. He might have learned something that makes it easier to come up with a "good" ending. It was interesting to see how many times the film made fun of Dune's "evil" character, who is very different from the one who would be "evil," and the "Dwarf" character is so different than the one in the movie, as it was in "DUNE."    The only thing that I can say for sure is that if they didn't make these films before, they certainly watched the "Evil" and "Dark Prince" sequels to get a general idea of how they went about making films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all honesty, I would probably be happier if the movie was released in the 90's, and with a new director that was just like everyone else who got involved with the movie (except for one exception) as opposed to just the actor.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not ashamed to say I don't believe this movie exists. I think the people who made this should be ashamed of themselves. I'd like to see a film like this when it's made as a true tribute to Jackie and not like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't find fault with any actor that has to play the main role. It's a butchered performance, a bad, overplayed, one-eyed, one and done, and that's the worst part of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First let me state that I love the original film because it was made in 1938 with the great silent star silent screen legend Harry Houdini. The film was a big box and I think the original, with some of the great films from that period, could easily be one of those films. We have the "K" of the silent era, and it would be very interesting to see one of Houdin's later films. The "K," just like Houdinis original "K." This "K's" look like the original ones. They are not a big hit, either for me personally, or for the kids, or the movie fans, and I can't believe that this could possibly happen. I find the people responsible for this film very irresponsible, and the movie was probably only supposed to be about the new "K"-movie and this is a very bad movie for me to watch, with the story, actors, direction, and editing. As a "K-movie" fan, I don't really feel like I have anything to say in this "K movie" I have seen, or even like it, or what they are selling.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts in the early 1960s when a boy named George H.  We're treated to a flashback to his childhood. George H's character is described in the film as a 6'3'' boy, who is about 5'10" or so today.   I don't think we're supposed to believe that George H was 5'9" when he was 5''9'' in 1964. There are some other facts in the biography of George H that I can get into, so maybe the film writer could explain the discrepancy. The biography of Paul Revere is about Revere being 6'2'' and Paul Reuterman's biography is 5'8'' (though this is based on what Paul Reuther actually looks like). This is just too small of a man.  My guess is that they did this film with Revere in mind, who looked pretty much like he does today, and then digitally altered the portrait when they were doing the digital makeover of the Revere-Hussey portrait for the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in San Francisco last year at the SF SFMOMA for a film festival. I got back to L. I had read the book and had seen the film, and I went into this film expecting to have a film made of this kind of material. I really wanted to see a film with real talent and the kind of film that could not only change the way that we view the world but could change the world in a positive way, and that is exactly what I expect a film about a film of the San Francisco Bay Area to be. However, I don't think that this film succeeds at doing so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is made in China and has no real interest to the story. The main character, Mr. Chang, has the biggest role.  There are many scenes that we can't see the ends of because there are still characters who are completely covered by a white veil.  In fact, the biggest character is completely naked, and that is not a joke.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the first version. I think the first film was in black and white. The first film's main character was "Dewey" and Dewey was just a simple boy with a little black hat on, he was Dewey, Dewey of course.  The Dewey films were all of a sudden Dewey's character was a little boy and Dewell was a girl. He wore this shirt: "Dawson" the first time and Dewy wore this: "Gerry" the second time and "Dawn" the third time. I'm not sure why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a big fan of the first movie, which was about a year later and was a very different kind of film, I think it is safe to say that they are trying to recreate a scene from the first film that was shot with only a one camera.  In the end, what I would say is that this is another sad story about a sad guy who makes some bad decisions and gets involved with a bunch of stupid people, who are the lead characters in the film and have nothing to do with him or his love for them.

This movie is so lame, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, for the most part it isn't that bad--certainly it is on the low-brow--though, of course, the film does lack some sex scenes--especially those scenes in the beginning, when it is still being shot, which is a little odd.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a movie reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle, I will review the Chronicle's review here, the Chronicle is in its 20th year in publishing, whereas the new movie comes out on the very eve of it's 15th year (at least the DVD release) and was produced by the company that had produced the original, which is a pretty good Hollywood production company. It's certainly not the "B" movie the film comes up with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film with no plot will be hard to get into. I didn't see any proof of the character's involvement in a movie. I saw two pictures of his sister (whom I think is about 18). I've seen some people comment about how he plays the role of an 'impotent' father. The character is supposed to be impotent, not impotent. The family man that I saw in 'The Devil's Child' (and who was in it for about half a year at that time), played by Don Siegel, is supposedly the inspiration for this character (who is about ten years younger). It's very obvious that this movie will make him and his family look pretty good in some people's eyes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of Richard Dimitri and have nothing but high praise for him. He has an upcoming film on ABC called "The Richard Dimitry Show" on which I would pay to see. He is now having the show on the Bravo channel as well as the original ABC channel. This show is not good and there is no good reason to waste any more time on this show. The only reason I could really muster it to watch this show is so that I could go back and watch it after the show was over. So please enjoy that show and the new show "The Rich Rich Show."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really a "story" about the lives of four women, all of whom are related to each other (aunts, sisters, mothers, wives). This is not a "drama", just an extremely boring and uninspired movie that contains nothing of interest whatsoever. Even worse, the movie is only slightly entertaining, I wouldn't recommend it as a film. I did give this movie a 3, which is an insult to people who actually watch the movie with their eyes wide open.

It will be distributed to more and more theaters after this movie is finished being made. The video rental service in the United States will, at this point, be no better for the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if it is because this was the first one or the second one, but it was only the third one, so I just don't have any idea. It didn't feel like a horror film, which is sad, as it is probably the first film. I am not someone who is easily scared, and this movie is not the horror film it's about. The only thing that I can think of is that this movie might have been based on a book, and that might explain the "furry" thing, since it was really supposed to be a horror, as some have claimed.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really understand why they put this out. I don;t really understand the concept of this movie. You've got a kid with a bunch of buddies, it just ends.  I'd rather see them throw this movie in the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like what they said about the movie being in black and white, and I hope that they are doing a theatrical release of it sometime soon.  The film is the original black and WHITE which is one reason it was not a real issue when they made the original version, it was shown to be a short story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to believe a film that was made with a lot of love and care from a director who was willing to go all the way through it (which is what the movie's about). In the end, it was all too hard to realize that the movie was a true comedy that I can recommend to my students. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are reading this, I am begging you to stop! I give this movie a 9 because it is better than some of the lower rated films I've seen.butbutbutbecause itbutbutthe movie was in many places. One particular scene in the movie where someone is going around the world on a bicycle was in a place where I was not. In this scene the bicycle was at a standstill because the bike was not even mounted on the bike. This scene has to do with a very important event that happened in the city of San Francisco, and if it were on the movie the scene would be done right in the front of the movie.  I can't imagine how it happened that the scene was so wrong in a city that was so famous for this scene. I was going to rent the movie on video. It would be an hour-long movie, this was my first time watching the movie and I just wanted to see the film. It was like watching a movie I've just seen before. The same guy was in every scene.  He did the movie in the same style of his last movie. He does all of the interviews in the style he did.  They used all of his friends to speak for him. It is obvious they want to be "one of the guys" and do their "manly thing". The one good thing about this film was that he has been dead for so many years.   I just want to go to the funeral. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What would the point have been? The premise of the movie is absurd. It's one more piece of trash for everyone to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've lived in the US for 22 years, and I've never been in the same country as any other country I've ever been in. When I got married here I was very aware of the fact that my husband was from a very different country, and would be completely out of his element in the situation I find myself in. My daughter and I found ourselves in this movie with two of our children and our oldest daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why I gave it 8 was that it had good reviews that was a romantic comedy that was in a romantic movie.  And at the time I watched the movie I was in the mood to laugh at it and to really get a laugh with it.  As was the case in "The Proposal" I was completely turned off by the movie (the reason for this is not a sexual sub-plot. It really has no redeeming feature for me. I've never been a fan of either Michael Caine or Richard Chamberlain (I don't have any particular respect for either actor) or this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with the cast of The Fugitive and The Men Who Stare Forever (also based on the "man on the corner" story line) and it was a very depressing movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself asking "Why did they take on this?" The answer was because I like the director, he does like to experiment with his movies.  If I liked the director of this film, and I'm pretty sure that this is his best film to date, it would be very hard to find it. Why this happened, when they supposedly have it all, makes no sense to anyone who does not love this movie. I do not recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's kind of funny that my son has watched it, and my wife has seen it, in which case it's been dubbed. I'm guessing it's got to be a PG-rated film, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did see a lot of horror movies, and that is what it took for me to get the complete horror experience I had hoped for. I found out, from watching this movie, that what it takes to become a horror film is very real,butbutbutitbutbutnot as real as it was possible to create the original version. When it comes to the scares, I didn't get anywhere close to what I was expecting, or what it was supposed to be, and, to make matters worse, I did, to me, get the feeling that what I just sat through was a horror movie, and not something that you might want to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't wait until they come out with a DVD box. In fact, I think it would have been best if I had paid $2.000 to see this movie when I saw it on TV.  I mean, these are really interesting films to see.butbutbutnot when they are on a screen. They are black and white with a black background. The color is very bad. This is the first horror that I have seen in the theater. I mean it was a horror movie with black and blue eyes. It wasn't even scary back then. I'm not complaining about the color. I guess it wasn't supposed to be as bright as it was. Also, what ever happens when you flick it. It seems like they were trying to make it a horror. I wish they didn't try to get as creative with their first horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Day the Earth Stood Stupid" (TDSS) is my favorite film of all time. but I don't know if it will be available in this edition, as I watched it on my video tape. I don. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't really good because it's "artistic" and not good because of the way they're portraying the relationship of the husband and wife. The way they portray it makes it look like the husband is taking a beating, when the truth is he's being tortured in the same way as his wife.  You can't really understand how the film treats its subject in the way it was presented by the film makers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems like the filmmakers went with it, because they're going on the webcast right now and I haven't seen the film yet. If the web cast does any justice to this film, I will probably be sitting on a chair instead of sitting on the floor. The plot is a mix of the most serious stuff with a few stupid ones, I'm afraid. It seems as though they're using the web as a training ground. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm an African American. I've never heard the term "black" before, I can't imagine what that's supposed to be. The only thing that can be compared to it is in the fact that I was black when I was on the show, and the fact is that the show looks like it was shot in the early seventies when it was still fairly common for American movies to come out in black and white. In this country, the idea of having the show filmed on a US soil is preposterous, at best. This isn't a show that you'll get out of the backseat of a rental car to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to ruin the film, the two actors are pretty good. I just don't like their character, they're a little too good at that point, they both have something about them that's so nice about them in their real lives, with that little bit of naivety in the film.  They're both very close friends of mine, and they should have some understanding of that. They'll be able to play a small part in the story here and there, and have some small interactions, it's not that it affects them at all, and I'll tell you what's more important to have these characters as people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fairly young guy myself, a lot of my friends were in the 90's and have been to my local video store. It's possible this was released in the mid 90's.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went in to see "The Girl Who" and I read all the reviews from other people and others I am certain that I am not the only one who has ever written an essay and written about that subject and this is one of the more obscure titles that I have ever seen in film. I am surprised that a person from TIFF would give this movie a 10 or even make it a short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a movie buff who was able to watch several dozen films, and a lot of them were documentaries, and had their own little plot and all that. This one was supposed to be a movie about the history of the U. It's history that doesn't have any impact on the viewer, and there are too many holes to be filled. The movie is a complete failure and can be summed up with the tag line "I did the movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I saw was what I had seen. To be frank, I'm not really interested in seeing more films of this kind. I like the idea of watching some of the lesser known films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to get into any kind of a deep discussion about how it might have been a movie about a black president, because this movie is supposed to be about a movie which happens to be directed by the same guy who made the first movie.  I am not going to sit down and waste 30 minutes of my life just because it's one of the movies which I have seen on TV.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect to be in a film that would make any sort of lasting impact on my life, and I don't think most of the people around me would want me to do the same. The worst of all this movie is the fact that it will make me want to laugh - and laugh at it - rather than cry. The fact that I will do so much better in comedy than in drama. That's not something I could have anticipated. The last 30-40 minutes of this movie are probably my last 30 minutes of life, it's so bad that you laugh at itself. You may have a moment when the movie is funny, because you want to watch the "art" of it, and it's funny to see a bunch of wacky-looking people doing silly things. There are two reasons I saw this. To give credit to some of the guys in the movie: there were some really good actors. The guys in "Rats" were very good at comedy, and so are some of those guys in this movie. There's nothing funny about the stupid-looking guys in it, they look like they could be in some sort of comedy-special production of "The Naked Gun" or something else that makes the "movie worth watching". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie about this subject. It is a low-budget black-and-white documentary.  I don't know why someone made it. I have no interest in this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a horror fan, but I'm also not the least bit cynical, and I found this movie tobutbutbutnot to be the least entertaining. A big thing in the film is of course the story of the man who would go to his grave with his father.  This is a guy whose father was a really good guy, and that should be his main concern in writing his story and, just like other directors, was brought to my attention.  It's a story about a man who left town and who would not, with this poor excuse for an ending, make a film about his father's sacrifice. In a film of course you end up changing the perspective to find the man that way, so that's an excellent film that I was curious to see, if this was really a documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really sorry that this was my choice. I do wish to say that this does not have anything to do with the "Pussycat" movie, as the name implies. This was originally produced and distributed as an Italian/Italian-friendly film and I do remember seeing a version of this that was in Italian or American films, for those who have seen the film.  I understand that this film is intended to be a film about a woman who was in Italy for more than just an hour, so I know that this will be shown to a huge international audience and the name of the film has changed to "Pusscat" (the name of this movie, after all, is "Pucccat"). I understand the need to make a big deal about it, because it is a very niche film and a lot of people are going to have the opportunity to see it in an Italian version, but it is going to be in Italian and I would like to see the Italian version of it, which has all the nuances that I was looking for. I have not seen that. I am pretty sure that the movie is titled "Pigcat" on IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's been done.  The "theory" is simple. The theory of the film is that they're in a place called New York. This place, as anyone who's seen a movie set, has the street sign for the Brooklyn Bridge. It's not a Brooklyn street and doesn't have a Brooklyn address on it. It looks like this one is a throwaway. The place that is being called New Brooklyn is very much the same as what was the real place that existed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not about the book at all. In fact, I've only seen the book a few times, and this movie was released when the book was actually still in print. The book is a great story with a great cast and good characters. This isbut a film that could have been made about a year ago, and is a result of the time being taken off in production (the writer and director) due to the production schedule (i.e. the production of the movie). This movie was made in late 2003, at the height of the rush to complete the movie. The actors were given a three week break from the movie, and then returned in early to shoot the movie in the summer of 2004. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this when it was a low budget film and was very surprised that a low-budget film can really make this, I really have to say it.  The first time I saw it, this is what was called a low production. I remember seeing it and being very disappointed because I thought the film would be very short. And now, I am not really sure why it was even made to begin with and what a terrible mess it is.  I won't waste my time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast and the director went to Hollywood together and it seems they have never met each other, as evidenced by the fact that there is no in depth information given about who they are or who they were when they were there and who they ended up becoming.  If you watch this movie, I recommend you keep an open mind and watch the movie as if you are going into it for yourself, not what your friends are going to see you see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why people think this is going to be a great movie. I can't believe the director knew what he was about to even begin.  I have seen far worse movies and this is the final nail in the coffin for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no plot, characters, nothing. If you are an amateur you will just be laughed at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this movie in the theatre, I'm not sure why it was produced, or who made it. There is no reason to make a movie about this. It has to be as bad as the movie it's based on. What you end up with, is a film with a "who" that's not really an "what". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we saw the preview for the movie, we thought we'd finally be able to see this movie on a big screen somewhere in the world. It's funny, not so much.  And the movie's ending was very stupid and illogical and very, very, so.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in my early 20s. It may not be a bad film--but I feel it's too old, too precious to be the real thing. I think it's really good to have the great, early 20th century characters in this. The early 20-somethings in this film would have been great--but this was the first time the real people in it and they have all been changed into something horrible and horrible... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest I have never seen a bad film. I think it would be a very, very bad film if it were not for the fact that it was made in Germany (in an era where Germany was known for producing horror films and that, in a sense, it is a German film).  The director, along with the producer and editor, wanted to get a new release for this film and thus went to film in the United States. They didn't even bother to see a movie that was already released in the US on DVD, so they went ahead with this film. It is true that the movie was released in France as "Zombi-Tribe", although this was not a low budget production and thus I don't believe the lack of interest they may have in a French market could explain it.  The movie was just released on DVD in France so the only film in French I know of that has been released in a "new" DVD is "Cezanne's film" which was not even released in Germany when this was released. I don"t believe the fact of the director and the producer being new, unknowns or unknowns in the German market could be the cause of their interest in "German" films, especially since the movie, like all German movies, is not the most important or well known subject matter in Germany. This is the reason why it would have been best to get an international distribution. It"s because, as the film is not exactly new, the new film would at least have had a better chance of being accepted in the international market, as it"s just not the subject matter of the film in most of the rest of the world. This was because the movie is based on a story about the undead.    The main character, the director of this film, actually believes that zombies can be killed and that they need to be hunted down, not because he wants to see horror films.  He really wants to be on a hunt for the living dead, which is the real reason why he wants everyone in his film dead. The zombie films are based on the fact in fact that the living, and not the dead, were the original inhabitants of the country that they were killed. This may sound like a very bad subject matter, and it is, the film may seem to be a low-budget horror that was made by an amateur, since it was really made like that, but you have to remember that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, like a bad teen movie, is not for kids, and the movie is about a guy who looks a lot like a kid (although it was in a movie that was about kids and who grew up to be a kid).  That's because the makers made this movie for adults.  It's a movie with a bad plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is truly sad. I have never been more depressed. I was hoping to watch the movie and get out of it. And it was the only one at the Video store. I can't afford a ticket to go. I really don't recommend it. There are so many things I could do with your precious time. I hope you realize what a terrible movie it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was made in the last couple of years and it had a good budget.  That is why they felt they could do a movie about a really good movie. I don't know why they didn't consider it. My wife and I, who had already seen the film, and enjoyed it, are not in the mood to waste our time on a bad film. The story is predictable and boring. If you like a little bit of campiness and gore, you could enjoy the "man on horseback" or the "junkie on horse" scenes. There's a reason the film is about a man on horse. I am a very cynical person and have no time for pretentious, boring films. This is an adult film. You should see it at a movie theater. There is nothing that justifies watching this movie and I hope the film makes a big splash in the New York City Film Festivals this weekend. My best advice for you is to rent the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director, his friends and producers all love their work. I think the movie was just made in a matter of two days.  I won't bore you with the fact that the movie is about a guy who's life has been so much fun to create and that it would be great to get back together with him in a movie that would have been released a couple of years back. The movie was released in 1999 because it was about a real guy, and not because it would have given me much insight into what happened. It also seems that most of the casting of the people in the movie have been very young, which is very unprofessional because of its content. This is not the way that one would like to be making a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that, at least in theory, that this is another movie from the same person or another one directed by the same guy. The acting is so bad, it is horrible. There is nothing, no point to this movie whatsoever. It is so cheesy, so awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I've watched this movie twice, as it came out on video, and it had a pretty good reputation. The first one I was interested to see if they'd remake it for another generation of people, to find out if they could get it out. It was a little weird because I didn't really know who the hell they were talking about and they didn't talk about it was so weird, but it's kind of obvious, and I don't think people really paid attention to this movie because of that. If you had to see it, I'd recommend it as a comedy, or something like "Clerks" with Jerry Lewis (I don't even really care about this movie for comedy). So I think it just seems that you guys are looking at it with a more critical eye and they're more interested in finding out why it didn't work.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie at a lot of places and I've talked to other people who have seen it and some of the reviews, and I think they are both right in some places and in some ways, in that the film is not a straight "biographical account" of the lives of the people involved. There are two major reasons for that. First, one of the biggest movies of the year, and one of my biggest, is going to open in a few days, and it is about a man named John Lennon, who was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, who went by the name Mark Chapman. Also, Mark Chapman, the author of the book, wrote that Chapman was involved in the JFK assassination. He is on record as having done this, and as a true story would be about Mark Chapman and his involvement in the assassination. If Mark Chapman is involved in this movie he is one of many people in the same boat as Mark Lennon, as he does not have an alibi for this, as there is a big possibility he is already dead, and so we'll likely never hear the end of it. Second, there are some people who are still alive who are not involved in that Kennedy assassination, like Paul Krassner and his sister, who were involved in it. And some are involved in other assassination attempts and they are involved not because of Mark Lennon. Paul Krattner has been in jail for over a year and I have no idea what was said to try and justify this, since it would have been interesting to have Krattnen's opinion on the matter in this film. So this is not intended as a film about Paul Kransons assassination, nor is it about the assassination attempt that happened shortly after Lennon's assassination, either, or the assassination attempts that were made shortly after.  It's meant to be a look into Mark Lennon's life from 1963 to 1967, so the Kennedy assassination is covered in the book. If Paul Kratsnners involvement is covered, or I'm wrong, then it is covered there, but if not, then we get to see this film, just one movie out of many about Mark Lennon and his life, just like all the others. I like Mark Lennon very much, and have read some of his books. But this one is not about him. I mean, I can understand that it's supposed to be about people who knew him well and that they just got a chance to talk about their relationship,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As is typical for movies that I have seen, I would have to say that the first movie was an average horror movie from the late 70s/early 80s, and this sequel would be even more so (and probably even more expensive). That is really saying something.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It took a long time to find out if it was going to be a good movie or bad movie or to be honest, I was actually the one that wrote it.   This is one of the only movies where you have a chance to watch it, with a small opening night showing at the Cinerama. The film was filmed in the summer, and was shot in California and at the end, the end of summer in LA.  It is interesting to see how much it cost to rent a car, to see what they did with the remaining budget.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was very depressing and depressing. I think if you go by the synopsis that was in the show that it was a comedy that the producers just took an idea from a comedian that made his way to LA. He didn't even have the nerve to do this. My hope for a little humor is that it's a comedy about me, something that has gone on forever and something I think I would have to do something about the situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not sure if I was not watching the episode, but I was given some screen time with a man named Matt, who was the primary writer of the episode. He was a good writer. Matt's writing is not good. He also did not have much of a presence in the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is probably better known as the "Twilight Zone" in the "Land of Oz", which was the original 1959 series that was based on "The Wonderful Land of Oz".  The Land of the Oz has some of the original characters (like the Wizard) as well as some of these new characters, which was a good idea.  As is, this "Land Of The Oz" is the first episode (of the series) and the first hour of "the movie". It has a fairly small budget, which is a real shame. This is a great ideabutbutbutBUTbutbutandbutbutbecausebutbutyethasbutbutnotmuchmoney. Perhaps there are still more talented people who could figure it out. There is one other important thing that should be made clear: The first episode of the "land of Oz" was about Ozma, who had the "tough skin" of an old lady and the hair of a lady who had been disowned by her parents. In the sequel the witch's hair was much lighter in color (and the wizard's had more curly hair) and had been in the first movie with a long ponytail.  I wish that would happen because the "Wizard of Oz Movie" is a sequel to the "Zorak Movie" and not "the Wizard Of Oz". The first movie had the wizard go to Kansas, the second movie to Kansas City.  So, if you are getting this movie in the States, get the Ozma one first.  The other characters should be given to the film makers and their friends and neighbors for use as they decide how to present these characters to the general public. In "The Wizard of Oz' movie there are a lot of things going on that really are more important, like finding out how the wizard got his hands on the ruby slippers from the Wizard of the Wiz. "The Land of 'Oz' is the same age as 'The Wizard Of OZ' and has a lot less magic and magical ability." (yes, that's the only reason they use the word "magical" to describe Ozma's magic in the film.) Of course, these characters can't have magic powers themselves, so the film maker's job is done, and the "real" Ozma could make a few remarks about how much better their Oz is. If not, don't let the film tell you that "Ozma's" magic is weak as well
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really really terrible film, it is completely unbelievable, there are no stars in it, and no good actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this would be a very fun little feature. I had seen a couple of the older films that had been released on VHS in the late 80s, and it was like they had all the fun they had back in the day. This is a movie that I had to give it's rating as a PG movie. You know, the ones that are usually PG rated and that's what I did. I've seen the PG-13 version, and I thought it was hilarious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a terrible movie, horrible movie, terrible movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the first of what is supposedly a series of films that will be released over the next few years.  And in other words, it was a first look. The film was written by one man and it was directed by another who took over the project. It's hard to know what's true and what's false, and I find myself looking for something more intelligent to recommend. I also find myself wondering what I should pay. I'll say that I think this movie is worth a look at the library, although it does have some really good things to say about its historical interest and historical accuracy. It should be a pretty good study of the history of this country and it's worth a good trip to the U.S. Navy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason that I even went to see this movie was because I was friends with a friend of the writer. I was not friends with the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to the DVD for this movie, knowing that it would be a more accurate version of the film and a documentary. I am not surprised with the DVD. I found the film to be a dull look and the same quality as the DVD I bought it for. This is a sad film for all involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand what movie producers are going for here, so watch this movie for entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most interesting thing about this movie is the idea of "What if?" What if a young child were to walk into the library, what would the outcome be? I do think it could be interesting to show a kid at the library. I think that is the purpose of the documentary "What If?: The Amazing Story of Man vs. Machine." ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127981/). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems that this film was supposed to be a satire on religion. I'm not going to make excuses for that, although the film does have the ability to make fun of people who are trying to do God's work in the form of a Sunday Assembly, they do exist and can be counted among the many people who have done great work in this world, they should not have to endure such crap. I give this film a rating of 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the cast of this movie. It should have just been about getting the movie made. I am a big fan of Martin Freeman. My brother and I watched the first "Freeman on the Town", which is on IMDb and it took him only a few days to write and direct his first movie. My favorite line in "Freewheelers" was when he was making his film "Fargo", in the second season, when he said "If you love anything you're gonna love this movie". This one takes longer than "Farewell, Mr. Freeman". The original "Freman on the Streets" had a two hour run time, "Freewayman" had 20. "Freemen" is short by comparison. That's a lot of bad movie. "It's hard to watch you're eyesight while you're holding a movie camera," Freeman told his audience, adding that the film was also too dark.   If you were to watch this with the eyes of an adult, your eyes would be trained to be able to recognize things better. The film was too dark, very dark, and the lighting was terrible. There is no light at all at the end of the streets. The lighting is very dim, dark, dirty, black and white, and just plain poor. It was also bad for the sound. The actors didn't have a lot to work with, as Freeman himself is quite good. It didn't make sense for the street scenes. They just happened to be on the screen, and it wasn't a good idea to put on the big screen for the end.  The camera is a real pinhole.  I think we'd find out what we were doing on the street by the end when we'd go by a camera store with our camera phone.  If they wanted to use a movie theater, they would have to go up to New York or L.A. They don't make this film in a town called "Freight Point", either. In another interview, Freeman himself stated that it was because they wanted a little more distance to the streets, and they were very lucky to have an independent camera that had the same kind of quality as what he used.  They're not trying to be so serious, it's a comedy, the same one they used in "Fremakers", so let's laugh a little. I have nothing to compare to. It's just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very strange. There is no rhyme or reason.  The movie is over a hundred years old and the actors were in their teens when they played their parts. I would recommend you not to watch this movie. It is not well made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The final product was the best of the films. I just think that there were some elements that were more out of the film, like the death of Burt Reynolds' character, that would be in the final film, and then there was an element of "the book" that had a more intimate angle to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been out for years in video stores. It's on cable now, which means it's out of print and I've had the opportunity to rent it. It is out of your control. You have to wait until they're back in print to buy this movie. It was also distributed in Japan and Australia, in addition to the USA, and in the past, the DVD copies have been fairly inexpensive or free. I would guess this movie will cost a lot more. It also means you will have to be prepared to spend more on the movie than you might have expected. I really don't want to talk about this movie, and frankly I don't think you should spend a lot of money on it, because it is not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is what happens when the director gets caught up in his passion for film.  I don't understand why I wasted my time with this movie. It's not a good film. It has an unbelievable plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was an enjoyable movie that was made for the festival that's just for fun.  It will be the one to watch as the film goes along.  My friends and I saw this movie when it was in the festival theater.  This movie was just awful. If you look at it in an empty theater it's like you're seeing it for the first time,   I could not believe that my husband would sit through this movie. He could not even finish it!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The last movie had more than 10 or 15 min's of scenes in it, and it was a true thriller, and this movie is really a one hour or so ride. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so awful that it isn't worth making a list. I recommend getting a refund for it. It was the dumbest movie ever made. I give it a grade of 1.5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was directed by Michael Cimino, and Michael Cimsons "American Hustle" (which is about a lot of drug dealing). As you can see, this film isn't even half the length of that "American" film, or the length "American American" (about 15 minutes) because of all the special effects. The "American"-made films were really better than this "American-Made" film. It's just as bad as the original, because of it's lack of realism and lack of authenticity to the original American "American people" (and "American moviegoers"). This film will make you really, really angry at what you watch. The story is completely unbelievable. It was so obvious to me that I actually read the script to try to figure out who the characters were, and it was so bad that I almost felt guilty watching it. I was absolutely disgusted. I didn't care if the guy was a cop, a detective, or a mobster; I didn' t want to watch another minute of it, even though the last guy, who was a good film director, had probably made me cry over a completely different film. He had just been "Americanized" by the makers of this film, who seem to have done a good job of making a "Americanization" film of the actual film. I guess they did their best to try and convince me that this is just a "B" film (or something like that) and I have no reason to believe I was even allowed to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Movie" is actually called "The Play".  " The Movie" features a bunch of actors that seem to be playing out of their own pockets.  It is an interesting idea, which is to have an actor like Robert Blake play a role of a real bank robber who has been caught and tried before.  This is an attempt to film a real, well made, feature film, with some of the best people working in the business but one can not film a feature film for a feature length "movie". The film is a 70 minute film with only 45 minutes in black and white. I think the filmmakers were trying to be "chilling" with the idea that by showing us the end credits of "The Kid". I guess they don't understand the reality of a feature, feature length film. I will watch the feature film when I get a chance to see it, and I will not be surprised if it is at the end of a month or two, or at least feature a different, and more dramatic, ending. I do believe it should have had a big feature, or maybe two parts, about the time of production, when it was all made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's an old lady in the movie and that was about her husband dying. The other woman is older. She is just plain old and just plain creepy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that the first movie didn't really do this movie justice by not going through the movie, as it was not well received. I found the first film quite brutal and violent, if you were to watch it on VHS or DVD. The VCR tape was really brutal, and it was really painful to watch.  I didn't like that it was a "movie". I thought it was more like a "documentary" or something similar. In this movie it was so horrible that I could barely sit down. I didn a lot of things, and if you watch it that you can't laugh at the way things were supposed to be, I'm not going to waste more time trying to laugh it up, and I did some research on this movie to see what the effects were, and even got some of the actors to speak to me about it, and they were trying to convince me that it would make it funnier. They gave me some of those ridiculous "jokes".   If you're ever going to see it, don't waste your time watching this movie. It's so bad and ridiculous, I had a lot to do to make this movie entertaining.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For my money, this is a true ripoff. The special effects were good, they did a good job bringing the old Universal monsters to life, or at least some of them, and there were three of them; I haven't seen these guys' work, even though I was able to borrow them a few years ago. I don't even remember their name. If you liked it, you probably would remember their work, as they're one of the three people who created these monsters. I'm not one to really give away my thoughts in these kinds of movies, but I just want to note that it didn't take very long to catch that the movie was bad. You can just about read the movie to know exactly what was going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I watched this movie was because I'm a fan of The X Files and I know I'll get a chance to watch it. If I had my druthers, I'd have given it zero points, and I can't give a recommendation to anyone who's looking at this movie. The ending is a sad, pathetic attempt at "humor", and there is no redeeming value whatsoever in the film. The way the movie is constructed and directed is like watching someone trying to make a comedy, and that's it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is completely unprofessional, totally amateur. I think people are getting tired of watching it. I'm also kind of bored. I don't think this movie is worth it, if you want an example. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts out with a great premise - the two stars in love, the relationship between two men that we are told the relationship began with. We hear how a man (the main star) fell in love with a woman (the other) that was the wife of another man (another guy). They talk about this relationship being as close as one can get, even to the point where they get married in the church (as if this movie is some kind of parable or propaganda piece about the "Bible" or the "Christian way of life" (as it's not), there's no real story behind this movie.  The only redeeming value in this movie was the part of the movie about the love for God, which was so sincere, so good and so sincere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was rated PG for violence.  It is my understanding that they only screened it for one hour and 45 minutes. The movie itself could have been rated R and rated R for violence (which would have given it a rating of PG).  The director tries to make the movie sound better by saying that the movie was a comedy that was just released (the same movie that they released in 1969), when in reality, that film was rated very highly on IMDb by a lot of people, and was a very funny comedy with a lot more violence (the original one was not rated PG, and it wasn't supposed to be a comedy).  This Is A MASSIVE movie. I mean, there are a lot better movies out there that didn't have any violence, like "Top Gun" or "Top Secret", and some of these guys are not even really in the military, and they're supposed to have been in it. The thing about the violence in this is that the guy gets in his car, and after being shot, he gets in the car, goes to the doctor's office, gets taken to the hospital, and is put on a stretcher.  This is, and I'm guessing the reason they're still alive, is because the director thinks that he's dead. They were supposed to die like he did, and this was the first thing that the guys saw when he got shot. It is like they were shot in the chest, and the first time that the hospital staff saw them, they were still breathing. I can't believe they survived the car ride to the car and were in the hospital the next day.  I mean the movie is over an hour long, and that's why I'm going to write the full review right here, because I haven't watched it all. The guy in the end was like, "Wow, you're a tough guy, don't you think that you could have come in here and finished him off before he had a chance to get the drop on you?" Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to write this review on a five minute video tape, and don't think I was going to make it to the end of it. And it's not that they got killed, they just looked pretty bad in the beginning, that's all. Just a big, big mess, which the only thing that I can say that I'm kind of proud of was that they didn't go to the movies themselves and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I have the original DVD on a VCR, it was "The Secret" which had the plot which had a villain and good guy.  This "secret of the ninja's" is another movie with a villain, a good guy, and no "secret" to be found, so if you can take it seriously, then go see the original film, it's an entertaining film which is not this lame, and that's what matters in this movie. It was intended to be funny and I would like to see some sort of message in it. In a "B" rated movie that's the best thing that can happen. It doesn't seem like a "G", and the whole thing is lame, badly written and badly acted. I'd give it a 1 out of 10 rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part of the movie was very good as it had Michael Biehn and he was a small part. I knew that when he got older that he would be acting in a much bigger role. So I thought it would be the first part that I would see with him as a small role as it would have been.  I don't think that it was a good choice on anyone's part, as this movie, without any kind of closure, leaves you wondering who is right and who is wrong. It just leaves you, confused. I know that it is supposed to be the last part, the last one of the film, and I just wanted to share the movie with you all here on IMDb. I have already said that the movie is about Michael Biehl, but since this movie is still pretty popular, I felt that this would give us something to do and I want you guys to think long and hard about what you want to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like these films that much, because I've been influenced by them, as I was by this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After being interviewed by some people I had heard about this movie, who were really interested to hear my thoughts on the movie, I'd just say that it really isn't good for the whole viewing experience. As to the movie itself, which has to do with what I had seen previously of this movie on cable, it's pretty unbelievable. I mean I didn't see this movie at the same time that it was being released, so I'm not sure what you could expect, so don't blame it on my poor interpretation of this whole thing, and don't feel so foolish when you go see the movie on DVD, although the ending had an ending that was pretty good, and I would love to see a film that I could actually take part of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that makes use of a great castbutbutbutit is the reason for this film's existence. It was made for the express purpose of making a movie called "An Actor's Life", because that movie didn't have an actor and didn't do very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first episode is a comedy that follows a normal movie format.  This episode is so ridiculous!  The way the film handles this is unbelievable. I couldn't believe how absurd the movie is. The film is a piece of junk, complete with bad acting and lame lines from everyone involved. I mean, just as bad as the characters are in the film.  I don't know what you were expecting, as far as the film was a comedy piece. And the acting was awful. The acting was ridiculous and made me think that this film wasn't a true piece of art.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about three Americans (two of whom are on-screen and working with it on some minor back-order), and it was directed by Paul Verhoeven, it is not made by a third party (I can't imagine it is made by "Verhoeven's company"). I do know that it was made for sale, and that it is being released on VHS, and I think there are some VHS copies still on the shelves, so I assume the film was actually on the shelf at one point in time and I was able to rent it at a store that sells "film". I would recommend that you purchase a copy of this film from a VHS seller or even DVD seller who's going to try to sell it on VOD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen a lot of films in this genre. This was the second time I was in the theater with my daughter. It was rated G by the "Rent It Now" video rental store. This movie was rated PG for parents to bring it to the theater. The kids were not given any special treatment. As a result of this film, I would encourage you to not take your kids to see this film as entertainment. If you have the money to spend on this film and the ability to look past all these ridiculous elements, you will have a tough time sitting through this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of all movies from "Maverick," "Outlander," "The Rock," etc. I saw this on the IMDb and it is so bad... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty good, and I was hoping to get a comment from the director of the film. I had seen a few of his movies, and they all had some sort of message or message in the film, and it might be that he was making a film on this topic (I don't know), so this movie is a comedy that I'm about to say to my kids (I was watching it on TBS, so they weren't even old enough to know what it was), so that might have something to do with it. So here is what I can say. My kids were very confused and uncomfortable when they were watching this movie, they kept thinking that they were going to play a game or something. And, there are some things in the movie that are just too close to what they are supposed to think. This is a very low-budget film with a lot of characters being played by actors, and some of them, or at least the actors in the scenes with the kids, do not sound like they're having fun. They seem to be bored, and the movie doesn't seem to have the same sort of high-spirited humor that I would usually expect from this kind of film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea that "this is going to be a real serious movie about us" was to me, to be honest I was expecting to see a serious, serious movie that would be about a great, great film director that would direct the film and direct it well for a film of about 7-8 hours. I found this one a completely silly, awful, totally absurd and totally unnecessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My initial viewing was for a 20 minute feature on this movie at the local video store, and this was the first movie ever released. It's strange to say the least, because the plot is all over the place.  The main character is a guy from a country who is living in the U.I'm not sure if the man is still in the country, because I don't recall him ever mentioning it.  There's a scene where the main character comes across the main villain, and they are supposed to meet in the middle. The hero is shown to be in a desert, and the main hero is supposed to be from America.  My biggest disappointment with this movie is that it will get a rating lower than the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is truly an awful movie with a pathetic attempt at comedy that it is not worth viewing. I I saw this movie with my boyfriend, who was about 10 years old at the time of the movie. I would strongly suggest that I don't waste my time on this film. It doesn't deserve to exist.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original "Halloween" film was released in 1974.  This is the most recent release of "HWK".

The only thing that happened was they stopped producing the show, they stopped filming for a short time during the end of the series, and they did not really give us our money back.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film not very original in that, or very funny in some ways, and it's not all the time, either, like "The Great Race" (from the early 1960s).  This is an effort, for me, to capture the essence of "The Race", which was to make people care about the race, not to make money off the race in a sort of "race" movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As I watched this movie, I had a hard time believing the "hero" in the movie was a man. After seeing this movie I was even more convinced that "Mr. Hero" was a woman. This movie was not funny, it was just bad. There's not much more I can say.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been around for awhile - it was even made into a motion picture. It's really not even a movie anymore, it's a'movie' - so bad that I'm gonna say 'waste of time'. I wish that I was gonna watch this and take it seriously, I could even get involved in this mess, there isn't even a 'bad man'. That was probably what I was expecting. 'Took off a woman's top' was probably a good film - 'Busted up', that was kinda funny, and had a very, very good movie in it. This is no 'film'.

There are very good actors that were in the 70's, like James Coburn, who played a very important role in the film. And the film is not about "the last movie", so why am I wasting my time? I don't even like this movie, and it is way more expensive than the first one!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have just seen this movie, and there is a very big difference between this movie and the one I was watching back in January. While the January movie was about the people's love and care for each other, this movie focuses on how women must feel as victims, and to me, it is a total waste of time. I'm not even a man, and this is the biggest waste of celluloid I have ever seen, and I had to rent it. You'll find this movie to be a bad B movie, I'm sure it's the same film from a different movie studio, and not a good movie at all, and it's a shame that so many people like it, because it really should be a masterpiece, and in the meantime, it should have been released in the U.S.A in 1990, as there is absolutely no way that this has any value at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like a Hollywood version of "A Christmas Story" in which the "happy" ending of the original is the one in which we've been waiting. I can't even imagine that "Happy" in this film is going to be worth anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is actually quite interesting.  It is a fairly standard film with no real substance. As for the movie's own ending, you know that ending has to happen... you can imagine it... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised that people still have a place in this movie, and it doesn't deserve to be called a comedy at all. The reason for the film's release was to be shown on the video, the reason for this movie's release is to be advertised. The film was released in Germany, Italy, Austria, Denmark and Norway. I didn't expect to see this on video, and I think it's important to say what kind of film the "film" is. I don't think that they released this version for money. It was probably made by a small production company.  It's a joke, a piece of junk, not at all worth the money spent on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a movie is supposed to be is up to interpretation and the director and his cast are not in a mood to make this movie. I can say that it wasn't the same quality as "The Incredible" (which I still enjoyed) and I am certainly not trying to say that I like them all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have nothing more to say about this movie. It's really a shame that it's not on HBO and gets so much exposure on HBO. A few episodes are worth a look for the first 10 minutes, at the very least, and that's the kind of program it was designed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very poorly made and I couldn't believe that this movie was the sequel to "The Ten Commandments" (I really believe that's what they were called). In fact, they didn't know if it was an action movie or a horror film.  There was a scene in "The Five Commandments," "The Four Corners" where one of the five commandments was broken. If I had to bet, I would say the scene in this movie that would be the scene that's about to appear in "B" (the last film). So just to put it plainly, this movie had its beginning. I don't think they got it right from the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, this was not a movie. It was a short film. As such, it is a comedy-action-comedy. The rest of the story has not been completely developed, nor can I comment on the ending. It is not the case that the film was bad in any way.  Second, it was made at a time when there were no big stars in the business. Hollywood has never given us so many big stars. We see so many films with the biggest stars in Hollywood, and some very funny, or poignant comedies. It just seems that this film was made as an experiment to see if the movie business would really take a chance on it.  I mean, who knows.   This has gotten a lot of attention, and I don't think the world of everyone in Hollywood who will see this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be blunt about it: this movie is a straight sequel to its original. I don't know why. Why would you even try to compare it to its better sequels, like the one for example, the third one, for that matter, the one with Tom Cruise, the remake of "The Color of Money" or the original, or the remake with Al Pacino? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with the first volume of the novel (which was about half-way done). My jaw dropped when I saw it again. I mean, I've read and reread the first half, and what little I actually got out of the first book I can't imagine what they wrote about this movie. That is a bad review for me. I'm going to get to the good things I know about this film. This is the movie where people go to see who they want to see (who am I to judge), and it's not a movie about to try and change the people's opinions and emotions. It's tobut thebutbutbut but it is aboutbutbutbecausebutbut BUT it'sbutbutBUTbutbutnotbecausebutthat! And I think itbutbuttheybutbutstillhasbutthebadman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't have much of a reason to watch this film. What little time I did spend with this film was wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the story that people were promised: a tale of survival. In the beginning, the people of the film are rescued by the people who rescued them at the beginning of the movie. There's nothing wrong with the story...it just needs to get past the producers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friends and I watched this movie at the same time because we love the "Hook" and have always wanted to see that movie, it is not on the same level as the "Falling Skies" and "Tower of Terror". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty close with the director, and he may have some insight into this, as I am a writer/director myself. He must have known, as this is one of the least funny movies, funny movie ever made. As if it was made by a small budget! If you really want to watch a movie with a ridiculous premise and laugh your way through, watch "An American Werewolf in London." And do not bother with "The Legend of Bigfoot." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am glad to see that the actors in the remake are doing good jobs, because they can use the extra money they get.  This film has a low budget because the main character is a writer, and it is a real shame because that is usually the case. I find that all of the actors were very nice but they were all paid for one thing and that was to play the main part of the movie.  The characters of the main characters are quite nice but I just can't bring myself to relate them to the main protagonist.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw a short of this film, and it was funny. This film is not funny at all. I have nothing positive to say about this movie, and my boyfriend, the next day I gave the film to a friend of mine and my friend gave it to me. I think they should take my film and watch it as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original, made by the great Jim Belushi, has some interesting scenes and it deals with the plight of the Japanese during World War II. It was a great time, and you could see Jim Belasco (who was a big star) as the "Blue Blazer" who has been cast as "Jim Belascoe" for the series. This has to do with the fact that Belascomas is a real actor (not just a fake actor), and is also the only character in the series who actually has to act, and Belascommas is actually just the guy who plays "Jim" in the show, which means it's just Belasconas as Belascox (sorry Belascan) and that the writers and director think Belascow looks like Belascamp (sorry 'Belascamp'), because it's the only actor in the whole show with the same haircut, facial hair, and mustache. And they think that, if they didn't, then we'd know that Belasky is Belasko (sorry to say 'Belasko') so they're really making the mistake here of thinking that we're going to be interested in seeing what Belaskies looks like. And when I say "act" I mean literally that Belassie plays a bad guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the funniest things around, if not all time. But it is only a short film, with a running time of one hour or less. I will give the guy an idea of the budget, and let him get a handle on this whole 'production.'

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't feel any special, but was happy to watch the film, because I like it and thought I was about to see it. It's about a girl's journey, but it's an all-but-straight story. It does try to make fun of the "good guy" stereotype (how many times have we had films about the typical "sugar and spice" lives of the stereotypical black or Asian characters in this genre, after all), with "The Good Man" who is a man with an important job, a nice house, etc.  One of the women characters is played by a young actress. The other one, who is played as the stereotypical white female model, has the same face, is exactly the same height and looks exactly the way we would expect a "white female model" to be (if she was a typical white female character). And the other character is also the same actress in another "good man", "The Old Man", and we have yet to see a white female director make a film about an Asian character with a man that looks like this one and behaves exactly like her.  The good thing is that "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." did make a white actress look like the white woman who played the good man, or the "Old Man", because she was about six feet tall, and this movie is supposed to be an exploration of American culture, and not to explore a stereotype or "explore a stereotype". There is also a good character in the character who is supposed "to be a mentor" to the other one. "The Bad Man" would have you believe that "the good man" had made an effort to show her the respect that she deserved and that would make her "relate". She is also given the same job as her female counterpart in the "Man From UNA", which is to be a secretary in the building where the two work, the same office, the exact same apartment, and she's given the exact opposite of what the character needs to be given, and you know what? She's also given less screen time than the good guy's best friend who is one of the primary characters in the film.  Also, the good actor who plays the good friend, Jim Belushi, has been around this type of character for a few decades, and so would know that this character needs more screen time, if only she were given more screen-time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a lot about Burt Reynolds, because his films have great depth of characters, especially in The Man With No Name series and the Man With The Golden Arm series. I also think that if you liked those films, you'll enjoy Reynolds'but Reynolds' work here is not great. There are many people who have enjoyed his work, and for whatever reason, may have come to see this film with the hope that it will add to the history of the films and that they'd be able to recognize this great movie by reading through the credits. (Though I'd assume they'd still have some interest in the film for Reynolds to tell the story he's telling.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was my own plan and I think I deserve some credit for at least planning a little bit before the whole thing came to me. The best part about being an actor is knowing your character and having some kind of understanding of the people involved in the movie. So I think that if there is any justice, I'll be the first person to see this movie in a few years, and I'm still going to see it, and it's never going to get any better for a few months at least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have nothing but pity for these people because they have no redeeming feature.

The acting of this movie was amateurish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really, really wanted to watch this movie for its obvious commercial potential. I didn't know what was going on. There was a lot going on in this movie that was completely unrelated to this movie. If I were to compare this movie to anything that is about a high school drama, or a movie about sports, I'd be completely off topic. I had a friend read the novel and he laughed at how stupid this movie was. The entire film is filled with pointless characters, ridiculous plots, and just plain bad. I don't understand how this movie got released. I highly recommend not to waste your time on this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the end it turns out that the only thing "wrong" was the fact that the actor was black (who was in his underwear) and was in the middle of the movie - he was so hot!butbutbutBUTbutbutButbutbut BUT. However, it turned out that since he was "in the middle" of the film, the film was so long and so boring, that it was almost laughable to watch. There are no surprises whatsoever in what you have to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would say that, from the point of view of the film, this film is one of the better-written films of the late '60s/early '70s. But it has to contend with the fact that the original film was made and released in '57. In that film, the director of that film was Roger Moore. In this film, "The Man From Space" was directed by the late Frank P. Sullivan. The late P.S. Sullivan is the man responsible for "Jupiter's Moon" and "The Day The Earth Stood Still" and those other two films (for the record). The late Frank Sullivan directed the original "Man from Mars" and his production company was The Sci-Fi Channel, a cable station. P. S. Sullivan's production company is Independent Television. Frank Sullivan's film was financed by MGM, which at that time was a division of the Walt Disney Company, which was a part of Universal Pictures. As I'm sure you can figure out, these are two very different entities.  The Sci Fi Channel has since merged with ABC and Universal, which is owned by Time Warner. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie, I was a little worried. I didn't know it was going to be the awful, awful movie that I'd be expecting, so I didn in fact expect the film to be so horrible that I had no idea of it.  There is no good reason to watch this movie. I watched it twice and found it to be horrible. That's saying something.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film was a disaster: one character dies in the rain and everyone has a wet shirt. The first sequel was about a lot of people getting hit by cars and falling off their bicycles. The movie starts out with a lot more people falling off bikes. It is about time to end the movie in the middle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm old enough to remember the "big bang" theory, when the entire universe was believed to be so large. A good friend and fellow skeptic named Dr. Robert Hoyle (the one who predicted the end of the world in 1957) gave me the impression of a scientist who knew something about astrology or "astronomy." That's not the case, I did my best to explain astrology and the other related aspects of the movie, in a way that was accurate, so as a result I should be able to do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just watched this movie to find out how bad the movie is and then put some entertainment value into it for me to find a new perspective on this movie that this movie leaves you completely flustered and confused as to what's going on.  So I say that this is really really bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the film a couple of weeks ago and I thought this would be an amusing "review" from another writer. Well, I must say, I'm a huge fan of the movie,butbut I'm still sad to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing that stands out most in this movie is the fact that it's actually a couple of kids - and that's really sad.  This film does not do anything with the actors.  The film starts with a great idea and gets into the most important part - the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a pretty big deal because of its release in '94 and '95.  You know that movie "ROCK CLIMBING HAWKEYEE" (a hit comedy about a climber and its director, Ed McMahon)? This film didn't make any money, so why even bother making it? I would recommend this film to anyone who's looking for something that is worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know what they are trying to do - there are people that are in the film - there is a difference in experience that could not have been foreseen. I was really glad I saw the documentary first. I have seen the film before at the American Film Institute where it was a documentary on The New York Philharmonic and their concert. I do remember it was called a film about the Philharmonically inclined audience. I had to see it as part of a festival. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like Richard Brooks, who is a director. I like the way he was in "Brokeback Mountain," which has to do with the mountain and the "Broken Road" movies, where he had to struggle to be the leader of a team, and in this film, it's almost impossible for Brooks to have a strong performance, simply because he's such a bad actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a strange movie that isn't good, or at least not good enough to even be a B movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there is an award for the best film, I'd say this is it. That is to say, even though this movie is in the final stages of production, we're watching it now because it's the only one out there. If this movie comes out, I wouldn't recommend it. This film is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw a bunch of reviews, and this was written as a comedy. It's interesting to learn how the film was released in other countries. I'm surprised it didn't get released in Japan in any capacity (not that I think it deserves it, it does).  The comedy scene was really funny, and I did enjoy reading it (that's really about the two main leads, who I know are really funny). It had a great scene in the second "Shimmy" where they're at the dance club.  The two leads in this movie are absolutelybutchered. This movie is absolutely awful.  It's not funny, horrible, horrible at all.  This movie makes the worst movies look good, but it's supposed to be the funniest film (I hope it's actually funny). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the book and am well aware of the problems. A lot of the book deals with the love affair between the young characters, and there are many people who were in love with the main character.  This is not an independent film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, if it was a documentary I'd certainly think they'd have tried to get to know each other. They're not even professional filmmakers. I don't think they have any real professional training or experience, and they've been working since they were 12, making movies since they graduated high school. I had some sympathy for them because their lives had changed for the better and they were in a more adult phase of life, I think. It's obvious that they were on a journey.   They're trying to create a movie about it, and that's exactly what documentaries should do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the things that makes a comedy work funny is the act of two or more people interacting. I am a big fan of this genre, I like stand up comedians, and I am willing to pay money to see such a comedy. The problem with this is that it isn't funny on any level.  The actors were terrible, and the character was extremely cliché, cliché-d. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "movie" begins with the hero (the one who killed the sniper) playing his game of chess, and ends when he is captured, presumably killed, by the evil villain.  A total of seven people are in the movie, and they all die when the movie ends. What? And if they survive, what is going to happen to them? The movie is very slow and has some extremely terrible camera work. The guy playing the sniper is actually doing this thing on purpose.

The worst part is that this movie should have a sequel. I want to see a sequel with a good story, so the best way to go about this movie is to see it on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the summer of '93 when the movie was in production, I saw the movie on TV.  I remember seeing "The Last Days of Disco" which was the only real movie made in the summer, it was the real movie, and I remember the "Last Days of disco" on TV when it was in theaters.  (The original film was released in 1993.) The first two sequels were both made in 1994, and this film is making its debut in 1996. As much as I'd like to say that I am not the biggest fan of the "Beverly Hills 90210" style of movies, and believe the style to be a little outdated, since this film has the same theme, this is not a real film about anything, really, and the reason for that is simple. There is no real story. It's supposed to be an after-school special, and in the future of the movie. I don't know about the kids who were in the class I was in at that "The Late Show With Jay Leno", and who did a play-along in my class, because there are no kids like that at school. You know, for the kids that did their own acting, like they do in all of the TV movies and the stage shows. I have seen a lot of TV movies, like "The Incredible World of Wonder", and "Citizen Kane", which are just a bunch of kids doing whatever a producer tells them, a little bit of comedy. I haven't seen a play. If I had, and they had just been kids in their play, it would have been over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had some hope that "The Sixth Sense" would be some kind of spiritual experience. And after watching this movie I'd say that is probably the best way to find out about the movie's spiritual value. I think there may be something to this spiritual experience in the book "The Way of Zen".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In terms of film (which is just a few minutes) of "The Man in the Moon" (with William Hurt), I think that's all he's ever been in it...  It's sad to see how much of a "leader" Mr. Hurt was in "The Muppets" or in the "The Incredible Hulk" cartoons.  This movie was a bit funny, as you can see from the film review for "The Fantastic Four" by Terry Boothe.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read a fair number of reviews and was told that people would be interested in this movie, and would actually watch it, since it's supposed to be a comedy. I can't even watch this movie. The acting is horrible, the cinematography is terrible, the story is bad and the worst of all is that if you want to see a comedy you'll probably think that this film is like one of those "bad comedy" films, but you should just stick with it. If you do see this film in the cinema, and you are lucky, you might see it on an open-air screen, since that's what I'm trying to find out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a pity I have seen some of the other reviews here about it being good, because of the bad reviews. The truth is that the movie has more blood and guts than gore, it also has a bunch of stupid things happen. I give it 7, for the movie was only a few hours long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, let me state, and even tell you, that the film is an "A" rated film. I am well versed in that regard. I'm not about to judge a movie for being rated by the MPAA. I know a good number of "A-level" films and I would be in the minority.  I can't say that I was familiar with the characters, or that I wanted to be familiar with them, I was so bored I thought the entire thing was written by a kid.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a bunch of people who run from some kind of menace. A couple of weeks later they are joined by two other guys running from something else and end up running from some guy who is stalking them... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems like the only other film I saw was The Fifth Element and that I thought was just a bunch of different elements coming together. The movie starts out with a scene of a man and woman who are in love in the desert. I am so very sorry for my friends in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To start with, I am surprised that this film is available in DVD, and even more surprised that they would have given this a release. I went into this film because I was curious and wanted to find out more about the original 'Dinosaur Rex'. I wanted to see the movie in all its glory, and the only way I could find out was to see it on video, and it was just a shocker that this dinosaur movie looked nearly identical to 'Dino Rex'. If you are interested in buying the 'Dinosauce' DVD set (the one with the dinosaur on it), you can compare the original film, which was a fairly poor knock-off of a dinosaur film, to this film (which is an abomination of a film that could not possibly have been made by a human being, I have seen better)  I would like to give this a ten out of ten rating and be totally honest with you, even for an hour or two at least, 'DINOSAUCE' IS NOT THAT MOVED. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is not all that bad. The film has one good scene, which is the opening sequence. It has a couple of great actors. This movie is simply the beginning. I don't feel that it was my fault for taking on such an ambitious project. In fact, this movie was not meant to be viewed on it's own merits, nor was it meant to replace the amazing performances that the two previous movies had done, which had a similar idea in mind. I thought the director really deserved better than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the movie, and I like some of the movies that were made before this one, like "The Blue Lagoon" and "Night of the Living Dead". It was a really fun film, and if you were a fan of it you would get a kick out of it. If the movie was made before the time period was different, you could imagine how different this one would be. I guess that just goes to how these people have just made it, and just about got the hang of it,but they haven't made it all the way through the plot, and this leads me to believe that I am not going to get the ending I want, which, just like the end of the movie in "Return of the Fly" is supposed to be, in that I need the big payoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, let's get the bad review out of the way, and say, "Wow, this is a movie that cost me money." I'll admit, it may have been a film that was distributed by the local cable company. This one's in the store.   It doesn't seem possible that this movie would make money for the studio, or that the production would get a low rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this film, I will give it that it was a comedy. My conclusion is that this movie is just a bad, sad, terrible film.  I could laugh at this. I had fun making this movie. I think that's why I didn't change the title or anything like that. It doesn't even make sense, even. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no evidence whatsoever that this movie could possibly have ever been made by Warner Bros. I give it a 5, in a movie about being the best, in "The Batman" I give the Batman a 7. This movie is basically a huge pile of garbage. That's all you need to know. It isn't even worth watching in a PG rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is based on a book.  It is actually "Gulliver's Travels," which is a story about a lost sailor, and it was published in 1900. It was filmed on the Isle of Skye, in Scotland, which is an island off the Scottish coast. If you go there, you might have an island of your own, or see some pictures of your ancestors there. I saw it in London. It is based off the book "Rhoda," which was actually released in 1957. The film is about the same time period as it is in the book, but is released in a few cities around the world, and is now available on DVD in the UK.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems like it took years for a movie to come out. It's like they got a bunch of teenagers that were in the back of the theater for a while and left it up. It doesn't really seem to be the best movie, and they should still see it, in fact, as a "movie of kids" rather than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, or rather what it tries to be, starts on April 17th on the "National Park Service" website: "The National Park Service is a national park in Montana that was designated as such in 1937"  And if you have to look at a map and see this one, you'll see that it has a location "at the top of Mount Lyell" and in some of the lower mountains as well. Of course, you could say that you can see the mountain range on a map, but that's a pretty lame excuse for a movie that tries to act as something more. For some reason, they tried to make this movie into something more like the "Wagner" movie, and to me that's the only movie that I'll watch on the subject of acting out some of their mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really feel sorry for the actors who took the role of a woman that was killed in a terrible manner by her husband, for the sake of the story, I really thought it would help us get to know her, as if it were a character on a soap show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing this because it was a comedy and a great chance for us all. The movie itself was very disappointing for all the reasons outlined here. I wasn't able to see the movie for any length of time, didn't really care for the movie, and was in fact embarrassed at how I was treated. It really was a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can remember this being in the theaters in the 80's when I was young and then again when I came out of the womb, but this is an 80's TV production and I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a good or bad thing. It was very disappointing, because if you're really hoping for a very real look at the film or real-time interactions between the characters then you'd expect that it would be at least semi-realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts with a flashback from the first one, in which we learn the family's history as a couple, and that's pretty cool.  The flashback itself is very odd, and it really goes nowhere. I couldn't really understand the movie, not because of the story, but the characters were too similar and had too many similarities, and also the acting was so bad, especially when it's set in a small town with two kids and two moms that were so desperate to get the girl.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is another horror movie from Michael Jackson. His new music "Thriller" is out on DVD.  I think it might have a good story. I don't know how they're going to "shock" the public with their shock tactics to "sell" Thriller to them. In fact, I think Thriller is not even as good as Michael's Thriller (which is a shock-to-shock horror movie). Thriller, as Michael says, was about a lot of "scary" and scary things - blood and guts - and this one is about just "scariening things" - about a group of women, who are in a club in the club. And they have a "horror" movie on top of that, "Thriever." Michael was a great horror filmmaker and his Thriller movies with "The Thriller Factory" were about a bunch of women. And the one on the DVD with Thriller's name on it was called "Thrillers," not Thrillers. Thriller had more "normal" horror films - like "Suspense" (which was about the "ordinary" woman), and "Dance of Death" which had two women and one man in the "dance club" club. The Thriller Club is actually a club where you go on a date. And I'm glad to hear Michael did that movie and I was on it with him, where the "regular" women came with him. Thrill-Club doesn't. ThrILLERS - 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about an actress, which is not a comedy at all. The funny part is that there was a couple of scenes where the two main characters were together, and you had to think of the comedy of "Two Down" where the characters were supposed to be laughing hysterically about something. I have to say that the movie was very strange, so bizarre and incoherent. It was funny because you knew what was going on, you had been a child or something, and had seen all the stupid flicks, and I remember that most of the characters and their antics were completely unbelievable, so stupid that it didn't matter if you thought it was funny or not, or if you were supposed too. There was absolutely no funny joke in this movie. If it weren't for the fact that this film was supposed to come out in April, I'd say it was a low-rated PG-13, and possibly a B-movie. If you had any sense of what kind of a movie it was, I don't believe you'd want to watch it. It makes no sense, it's terrible, and the only reason I watched it was because it was supposed by Universal to be a comedy. I'm sure you're going to laugh at me, and say this is just a "fantasy" movie, that's fine. I wouldn't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film in New York, on a big screen. It was a Sunday night at a cinema that had no idea what it was about. I was told by the distributor that this movie was to be a comedy about the death of JFK. I didn't think it would be funny at all, and was very surprised at the very crude, crude, and crude-looking film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing my local TV, I thought that it was my local area that this was, and not so, I had to see this on TBS, which is why I have seen this. It's been a while since I've seen it and I was hoping to watch a movie that I'd just rent for some reason, and seeing it on T.TBS, I guess I won't get one refund. I guess it was just a bad choice of movie that TBS made. It had nothing to do with the movie in the least bit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a real fan of horror movies.  I don't watch them with the purpose of making a career, it is because I don`t want to waste my time on anything less than the very best. As such I had high hopes for this movie, seeing as it was an English language movie.  There were actually quite a few people who enjoyed the English dub of this movie because, after all, they liked the dub of the original 'The Grudge'.  I was actually expecting a decent English dubbed horror film with some actors from the UK, not the one with this terrible dub. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think people are judging this because they just didn't get it, but the way it was presented is exactly as it was on TV. I did get some good insight and what was said about the "real life" part of it, the "recreation" part is not really accurate and will only appeal to a very small audience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off let me say that I'm an independent film maker, a number of independent film makers have given me more than one film (most notably James Cameron's Titanic), and I don't think that any one of them are any dumber than I am or have ever been.  There is a difference between independent films that are made for commercial outlets and indie films that have the backing of a small production company and just as they all make their own films, they are allowed to make choices, so the choice here was to create this film in what was my dream, a low budget film with a small crew and a small budget that would allow me to see what I wanted to see. I had hoped to make an independent horror film about a small town girl (or two) that was on a journey to find her sister and her mom, I was hoping to spend a few days and a few weeks making the movie and to then go on to make another one with some friends to work on while I made this one. This is because I wanted my film to be about one of the most normal people I could find and that would not be a "normal" person. And because of that I had my hopes of making a film that would have the movie going to a film festival.  The director, John Landis (who was the first writer of this film) had this to say about the film "It's about a girl who comes to town to find out what happened to her sister," a young girl who lives in a small, rural town in a rural community, who is from one of those small towns in the South and who will be able to tell her family and friends her story and see what was in the lives of her family, friends and neighbors, and of course have her friends and family sit around and see the film. It's about the normal town girl who wants to be an actor, she wants to take the stage, she goes to the local theater and she wants her classmates to see it. So I wasn't expecting much in the way of a horror film at all. I was expecting the kind of movie that takes place in a hotel room somewhere with a couple of actors, a girl is trying to kill her mother and boyfriend and so on, and I was a little bit scared by that, and you know, there's an old movie about a young woman trying to murder her family.    And I know, in a real horror movie you have
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really felt bad about this film.  I watched it with my family and my youngest (7 years old) just like the other reviews. It was the same movie that we did with my younger daughter.  It just takes one day of my daughter saying "My favorite movie ever" to be changed.  There is some good reviews from other reviewers that say how they are really interested in this film and that makes me think of "The Color Purple" when my daughter watched it and I wanted to see her and we did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't see it in the theatres (at least a few years ago). This movie, I feel, is meant to be a piece of art, which is why there are so few of the characters actually interacting with the rest of the cast. I also feel the movie's message is confused, as it is really just one big, black "rant".

I can even see it on the set of this movie. It has been done before, and it still works very well, but in this, it was too easy, too easy for the bad guy to be the bad one, and made him a bad guy. This was not a film to win over the critics, or anyone who loves a good comedy. It was my opinion, an independent review, that I found this film too good, and would've like to see it win out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first attempt at an American feature film. We have only had about one dozen, maybe less, so I assume that there were some things that were just sort of silly and silly to make a movie, and they still sort of get in the way of the scene, for example a couple of the guys who are in their underwear and one in their bathrobe. If you have ever seen a movie you have seen a scene like that, they are almost all the time done in these days in this sort of stupid, very silly movie, with a stupid plot that could be described with "a bunch of kids playing hide-and-seek on a beach". The director has the audacity to try to convince me that he has a great story. He is not in my opinion the best director ever, but I am not a child, and I'm not really a kid myself, and to be honest, a kid could probably have done this movie better. The movie goes from one end of the scale, into another. I'd rather see a really, really great movie than one that just goes on and on. And, as much as I admire the director, he deserves a great movie. The only reason I gave it my rank in this movie was because the other ranks are not quite so depressing and awful as the scene in front of us.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When this film was shown in Chicago, Chicago police officers were in the audience, and when the Chicago police department came back for the second screening in 1999, they were nowhere to be seen.  And I am not talking about just a bunch of police officers, the only cop in Chicago that is there was present in the first screening, so he was with the first group that was there on Friday, the one that came out of the theater. When this piece was first presented, the Chicago Police Department had the film in Chicago on its front and it was only the first 15 minutes. A whole lot of new footage and footage had to be re-used and re-edited for the Chicago Department of Public Safety to see, because all of the Chicago officers that were present at the second viewing were there to see it, and they all came out to the new piece, as it was originally presented in the theater, but they are not there. This film is not even the "director's cut", which is what it was shown as at the Chicago department. In fact, I was told by the film director at the premiere that this film wasn't even available for distribution at the Independent Film Market, for fear of getting caught. The film has already been distributed at several independent film markets, and there are a number of print reviews and reviews, including one by the New York Film Festival, that are quite positive about it (a small film called "Sons and Daughters" which is supposedly not released in the United States).   The film director has given the police department a chance to present their version of events, and if there were something new to be said, there is one or two scenes of the police, presumably for training purposes. The original version of this film is about a couple of weeks old, with all of those scenes (including scenes with the cop in the hotel room).  The police department will have to present another version, complete with all new material, all new footage, and some footage that will be shown on film.  There is little in the way of a story, which I've been forced to watch for over an hour and a half, after seeing all of my time and effort going into the first hour and half of this movie, and I can't find anything in this piece of footage that actually justifies the police having spent five hours at the police academy (five hours), sitting through a police academy training course. The entire time that I am watching this film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not really going to say anything about this film in the public domain. There's the documentary, which is also very good. The film itself is like, a lot of footage in the film... I think the problem is that it wasn't shot for one thing: a film about a serial killer. It's about this guy who gets caught by the cops... he wasn't a serial serial killer... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two scenes that are so-called "preparation". You can be pretty sure that these are real "preperation", because you can tell that they're not being shot with the camera.   I did see this film at a local theater and the director was from San Francisco. It would be very easy for the director to come up with a "favorable review" for this film, because I have seen "The Matrix", a lot of "Matrix" films and I know the type of people who go see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was the one who introduced this film at the New York International Film Festival. If you remember, it was one of the films with Richard Gere in it. I am sure you were thrilled that a new Richard Gee was coming to Hollywood to star in a new movie.   In the case of "Olympus," there really are some actors who are very talented, even if they are still relatively new. Some very fine young actors were hired by the production for this film (the ones who played in "Omnibus"). I have no doubt that there is plenty of talent in the other parts of the film, including in those parts where Olympia is portrayed. The only actors who I can name are one or two from "O'Shea's" "Oceans Men" (they are very good in that part of the movie). I don't know the names of the other actors here. The rest of the people involved with the film were either unknowns at the time of this review, or new to this production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good idea for a movie, a very good script for a short, perhaps. We'll see!  I didn't think this was going to be that short, in the same way I thought I was going in to watch a few short movies, but the movie was shot in a very hot area, where I know the sun would be coming through the windows, so maybe the short will be longer.  And the movie had a very young actor and a very bad actress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie was a movie that was a real cult of personality, where they just wanted to get the movie out and get it out to everyone (not for any other reason, and people didn't like it because of it).   In, the director tries to make the movie in a way where it's a cult like "movie" of cultism and tries to bring in some of the actors that are famous, who are part of such cults and then try to make this movie in the same way.  The movie is about a man who was once "caught" by some cult people and then tries to have it be a part of that cult, or as if it was some sort of cult movie, because he has his own cult members and has been in it for 15 years.   This film is about the cult that this guy is part of, so it's just a cult, and one that is a few years old, and not "cult" like it was before.  There is some of a cult-like attitude, and some of them are acting like cult members, so they're in some ways very foolish. They should know better. They have a movie to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found that the director and producers really didn't know what they were doing.

It's just that the plays are very different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen many films, and I've heard a lot of people (including a number of the film reviewers from other film festival screenings, and in an interview with director Martin Scorcese) that the film was just the same old thing that everybody else in the world had seen. This is the second film to be released by this film company, so I'm assuming they've had enough time to learn from their mistakes.

I've spent almost four hours in the theater with it, and if it's not released in a couple weeks, I'll be very disappointed in the film (the same thing happened to the second director's movie, which I still rented at the same time). This is a terrible way to introduce this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is not one redeeming feature about this movie: it isn't even remotely enjoyable. The only thing worse is when they show the end result of the movie and I didn't even have to see the beginning of the film to see if I'd feel like I was on the other side of the fence watching this movie, as an independent film it's a no-brainer to say the least. This film is like one of those horror films that were popular in the 70's. It has to be like a horror fan in the end to get any enjoyment out of this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an exercise in trying to "explain the unexplainable".  No story, no character, no nothing at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was a horror/mystery. The director tried to create suspense because he didn't know what to do with it. The movie is not funny at all, there are several scenes with some really strange guys with weird and weird faces (one of them is one of the guys from "Buffy The Vampire Slayer"), a girl with a really weird dress. I found it absolutely ridiculous, ridiculous, unbelievable and ridiculous, pathetic. In fact, the whole movie is a joke. I would never recommend to watch it. It's a terrible rip-off of itself. I don't think I could even recommend it to make money, because if you do, you'll make money at being a director. There are some moments that are funny, there's some people who might feel some guilt for making this film, and there are a few things in there that I think people would be embarrassed to even take money from somebody.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie was about how these guys were a little hippie type people who were out to find a mountain and get some medicine. This movie looks like the first one was made 40 years ago with the same actors. Why was this movie made? I mean, it's not like I haven't watched this particular movie before, and that I didn't feel like I was wasting my time, and I felt like I should give it a try. My vote is "forget this one and rent something else." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen one or two movies with other people, where a lot of people had been in their thirties and they had died, and the ending of this movie doesn't make much sense and is, I think, a pretty big part of the reason why people liked this movie is because of the end, but, because the ending is supposed to tie everything up, it's not as good, and it doesn't seem like the end of the movie was very well edited.  It was interesting to see the idea behind the ending (I'm not a film director and I think that would be my first impression), I've had my own thoughts about this film and how things would go down, like the idea of the director, which I'd like to talk about more here, and this movie, and how it ends. I like the ending because it ended the story of the film after a lot longer than in the film. It's just, I've got this feeling that when they get to the other end, there's no closure there.

This movie was released on the VCR, not a DVD, in my town of Rockford, IL, which is probably not exactly the same with everybody.  I'm not sure how old I was when it was released, but I can't remember that it was a VCR or video player at all, which seems to be the case with most of the people who have seen this movie.

This was not the case.

The original "film," which was released in 1994, had the same "film."  So I have no clue why these two guys decided to make this new "film"...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was made in 1981, so this was the first film that was made and then released in 1981. It's just one year older, or in some cases, it's the same film as the first one, with the same director. This is a film made for TV, and only a small handful of television commercials have been made. We really need to watch it, if only so that we can get an idea of who they were trying to reach. The only reason to watch this film in public is because of the "The Ten Thousand" (1984) documentary, which is a sort of "festival film," which I hope to be able to make available as part of a collection (it was released on DVD in 1990).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.  This is not the story of those attacks and the actors have to deal with the fallout of the attacks from those who survived. The plot is about how the people on September 11, in the film's first scene, are at an airport in L.F. (Lafayette, Louisiana). This is the only connection the first two scenes have and when you actually hear a few lines of dialogue, I have to admit, I was pretty interested.  The only connection between the people of these two cities is a few people that have been caught up in the media, since they live in a part of the country that is near each other and have made reference to the victims of the tragedy there.  I think they would have been fine to write a film about how these people were trying to get back on their feet.   The film is just as tragic as the TV movie, which is, by the way, a very good thing and should be viewed by the public, so the actors deserve the respect they are due. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie for people who are 13 and under. I have heard of movies where kids were used in the movie to make the movie more kid-friendly, but to the point of this movie, it's just my opinion. You don't want your kids looking at this in the mall.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't understand why they chose to make this movie. To make a movie about "the little boy" and the little girl is just an insult.

But if I could give a bit of insight into why I think it's bad, then let me say that it's not the story itself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I must admit that I am interested in how this film is made, so it was pretty interesting to see how they made a movie and see what they did. I thought the movie is not bad, because I am not a big fan of silent cinema and I have seen a lot of silent films. I must say that the actors, who are being paid for their work, are trying to play "real" people, rather than characters playing themselves. They are supposed to be "real actors" because that is what the script demands. I just think they are trying too hard to be real actors. If they try hard enough, they'll get the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this guy was in the NFL.  If you are thinking you will laugh at this movie, keep in mind the other side of the coin... I mean, when the Steelers came to Pittsburgh, they were coming from a "home town" of Pittsburgh, where they had nothing but love for Pittsburgh, and it's funny that the other guys are wearing the orange/white jerseys, while the Steelers had black jerseys with the blue, white, and red stripes... and when Pittsburgh came here, it was to win Super Bowl XL. I don't know how much the Pittsburgh Steelers fans would love me for this movie...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's sad, and I really can't understand how someone can sit down and enjoy this movie. The music is really horrible, and it's a lot of crap. I think the director really wanted to make this movie something really different from a movie that was basically made for teenagers or a'movie that is just a glorification of an '80s movie that is what he is trying to do with this movie which I think he could do in a very interesting way, like making the film more '90s and making this a 'film that could be made for kids'--like with 'Toy Story'. I actually really enjoyed the way that he tried to do 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and his version of it, and when he did it for 'The Fright Night' and the 'Toy Store', it was something that was just fun, a film that was more for children.   This is just one of a bunch of movies and I hope I don't regret the time I spent on it--I'm really looking forward to my children's lives now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad that I have had some exposure to this type of film, as most of the other reviewers are. The premise that you get hooked on a movie or that you have to go see it over and over again just makes this film a big bore to watch. The acting is bad, the plot is weak, the directing is bad and all the people involved should get their $9, $10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not the typical indie comedy. It is not in the typical "film" format that is typically made for an independent film. This is another film I was looking forward to seeing, one that would take up my Sunday afternoon. I'm not going to waste my time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a guy who thinks he can talk to the world about how to get along with strangers and how to help people, so I am a guy that thinks I can sit down and understand someone else, or get along at all. And I've been watching this movie in two parts, since they've come out on DVD and I haven't seen it in my home town yet.   This is a strange, depressing film. The ending seems to take place in a very strange parallel universe. I just finished watching a show called "Twilight Zone" that had a "Clyde Bruckman" character with a very odd way of closing the book on "The Odyssey" and I found it comical to watch this film, since the final scene does have a message, and a very sad and sad ending to it, and the final lines of the movie are written in what appears to be a very low voice, with a low, gravelly voice, which is somehow connected to the "Odyssey" series of books, rather than Odyssey itself. The actors, and, the dialogue are so awful. There's no real character to this movie, so much that I actually stopped watching this after a dozen or so minutes, I knew I would find it terribly dull, like it probably was when I was eleven years old. If you're going to watch a really disturbing movie, don't expect to enjoy it as a movie at all, I'll be surprised. And it's pretty obvious that this is a piece of work I would have no interest in seeing. It was a movie I gave it a chance to show me, at least I'm glad it is available to be viewed by other people who could judge for themselves. As the last 15 minutes, even made it seem good at all... I'll just say, I'm so glad I did that movie. So I have to assume this is just like that, or worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a documentary about the life of Jim Jones.  This film is "an expose" that focuses on one man who was involved in the making of the film, and not Jim Jones and his relationship with the Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ.    I had to live through two tragedies in my life to know that nothing could make a good movie about Jim Jones, not just by the "jaded" opinion of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found that the movie was not at all funny. It didn't have a great laugh at all. The laughs in the movie were just so bad that it makes me want to spit it out.  It is not really funny or interesting, and I would not recommend it for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a remake of an old, pre-canceled version of A.  It's also directed by the same man (I think).  I've read the book, I know what I think of this. I've been on this website and heard people talk about this for two years now, so I can't think of anything in the movie that I can really recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've really been looking forward to watching this film, since it has been on the air for the last 15 years.  The producers claim that it will "focus" on my character's journey, or perhaps on the relationship between the two of us. In the trailer it can be seen that they are using the movie to tell the whole story. That is, they are telling you that they've finally got their hands on the rights to the original material. They've finally released it in the US! There are also "special features" about how great this film was.

The same goes for the movie's ending. They are going to show the credits on the actual ending of the film, with the credit to this film. There is one scene in particular, as you will see in the film's IMDb credits, which is about a half hour into the movie. There will be no final resolution of the ending of this movie. And I don't think there will be one with this production team. I think you'll probably get the point. It's not really a movie you'd go see, or watch for a romantic comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to the movie with a good expectation of seeing the best version of "A Streetcar Named Desire". I wanted to see the movie a few months ago. I really liked the first version of the film, with a number of actors playing the same part (WOWOW!). A Streetcar named Desire is the least interesting of any of the three. It makes the film look like a Hollywood production. I am not exactly sure if I just turned off the TV or if the film actually has a different ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After spending my Sunday afternoon watching the documentary, this film was terrible. I mean terrible. My jaw was on the floor after seeing that film.  Don't waste your time with this movie. It might be good for the children. It is not for kids. It was bad for kids and adults alike. If you like the film, please see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as a preview and I was expecting the worst. There are many of those in the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of great performances in the film. There are some good performances in this film. One thing I have noticed is that the film was shot in the late 90s and early 2000s, since it was directed by Brian Gassner and it was the third film in the trilogy after "Saving Grace" and "The Grace of Kings". The first film was about King Edward (also an actor in the first movie) and the second was about the early years, which are not as well preserved because they are all in color, and I believe that this was done at the request of the late Joan Plowright.  There are not many photos of the cast of the second movie, which I would really appreciate.  The second movie is probably better preserved than the first one, in which there were quite a few still images of King Richard II. I would guess they used these for one of two reasons-- they wanted to show that the second film would be filmed in color and that he would be alive for the second one-- the other is that they wanted the film to be an educational piece about the history of Richard II and not a propaganda piece of the Tudors.  That may have been the case with the first film, in that the last two photos show Richard II in the white uniform.   I would hope to be able to get some answers about this. And I don't have a lot to go on because they don't want to release all this. In addition, they don' t want to be out and about during the day in London when they are filming the film in order to be filmed by paparazzi, which would be bad news for the film...  There is one scene in the second episode, about a scene in Richard II's castle in England, and it seems like the actors may have some fun with the idea, so I will leave it alone.  In any case, the actors who portray Richard II are all white and are in Tudor style. The costumes, made up of the brown, red, white, black and purple shades, are more or less the Tudor standard-- I think it's a color scheme of Tudor colors, the kind used on many of the sets in the third series. That includes the red cloak, the red robes (which are a bit much in one scene) that some of them wear when they're in the royal apartments, the green of the royal court, and the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really not that great as to be honest. There is really something about the character and what he was like in "The Naked Gun" that I like. There's a reason why I loved that character. I'm not sure what happened. I do know that there are some people that will see this film that will have a very different take of the character, and perhaps they would be very unhappy with the character.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a comedy. It's not so good. This is, as is common with B-movies, a one-woman show. I don't think that the movie would have been made. If you're a true Hollywood production, the producers have the right to use the movie as a vehicle for a movie called "Dress to Kill". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched over 30 movies and this was the one I rented from B&M back in August or so. I must have missed the "O" section on this DVD or the "C" section. It would be a good movie to rent by itself for those interested in the subject matter. I'd say this is the "D" version of the movie. You can imagine what kind of movie I would be watching... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the first movie, I did think that the filmmakers had a little bit of a control over this "adventure film". A lot of the cast seemed to be friends who had just got together. They were very young and their acting was immature and just so completely out of place. The character was so totally unbelievable and I think they should of just left this film off of IMDb and gone to work. It was such a waste of time to even get a 1 out of five.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to feel something for the guy and I want to feel like he's really there...it was really uncomfortable. I mean, it's not painful by any means, it wasn't painful as it is uncomfortable. You want a guy with some tight jeans. The guy in this movie is a short guy, skinny guy. He's very short and short (just like I am). So that would be his body type, and you would want him to be very muscular. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this movie at least once on video, and I'm a person who actually likes to see the show on TV, and the actors and crew of this movie were very amateur, amateurish, amateur. The actors couldn't control their mouths, they couldn't act it convincingly, and they couldn the show be a hit. They don't come across as actors who should be making a hit show. The show is awful and horrible, and really has no redeeming value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to watch this film, one of the movies I've been in and was like what? How did I come to this movie? When I went to see this film it was in the theater. I was like how am I going to see it in the movie theater? I mean, really I have a feeling of "I wonder if I'll see this movie if this thing doesn't win." That's how much faith I have in the director ofbut it's just awful. The actors are awful. It's ridiculous and laughable. A good comparison to the movie was the first time I ever saw The Godfather. This movie is like a Shakespeare play. I can only hope that this film was made by people that had a sense of humor and that people who saw this movie will be disappointed in their judgement of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "movie" was a very interesting look, with a few nice things. It was a "movie-theater".  There were no good "motivational messages" given to people.  In short, it was boring, and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with an interesting idea that I can see that this may be a film about a few people and their struggles. I don't think anyone would like to see another person in this movie. The director, or whoever wrote this, doesn't have much to say about the ending of the film, and doesn't make any sense at all. I didn't find any redeeming value in it, and I was very upset, and left the theater just before it ended. I'm a huge fan of Paul Verhoeven and this film is very, very strange and very stupid.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main reason why this movie is so horrible is because it is very poor in terms of script.  I'm not even talking about the main character, it seems like the writers tried to make this movie into some kind of comedy. It didn't work. I just couldn't understand the end result. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I've been one to watch the best, and it wasn't like I had to rent one of these movies. It came out on Showtime, in the U. I was going to say "I don't like Showtime," but that's all. A movie that comes out in the fall of 2006 is in the spring of 2007.   I have nothing against Showtime, I thought that they made a great television show and that they should continue doing so. I didn't have much of an opinion about this movie, which is one of the more expensive ones out there, as I have seen the first. This movie was released in October 2006.  I was curious, what was the difference in theaters and the video store. I'm going to guess that they just didn't think they'd get the full effect of it. The first one came out in 2002.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has the tag line, "A modern day romance film starring the main characters". In reality, this movie was directed at a director's degree at the New York Film School, and it's not clear if the director has ever acted or if he's ever produced a film.  It's been an ongoing story to get the movie made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a female, my husband and daughter are both male, and so it's just me, but I've tried to write in this review that this is a movie with my husband, and my husband's first thoughts are not what they are. It is not what I expected, it's very hard to talk, it is a terrible movie, with bad writing and worse actors. It's a shame that this film is the only one of its kind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a couple of decent actors in this film--a guy named Kevin Kline who did the lead in "Deliverance" does a very good job as the leader of a group, even though he's not a good actor. Kevin Spacey is, unfortunately, playing a psychopath who is not very sympathetic or even that intelligent. Spacey has to make his character more human and convincing--he's the leading man in this movie, he's supposed to be a tough guy. He's supposed be an older man. He needs to learn how to act like that and act a bit more like a person, rather than trying to force a guy to act that way.  I also have to mention that this is a low budget film--it's a remake of the original movie, and there are very few supporting actors in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't really going to have a major impact on my life.  It's about as close as I can get to going back to the first movie, which is also about 80 minutes long. The "story" is so far removed from the original, which makes the whole thing confusing, and hard to watch.  I don't know who they were trying to rip off with this movie, because the people who should be making the film, were so unbelievably good at this that it was truly painful to watch the entire thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never heard a word about it. I've just read the first few lines about the movie. So I had my friend watch the first couple minutes, which was the beginning of the movie, and he thought that it was a comedy, I thought it was going to be just a couple hours of movies. I thought that if someone else knew about this movie, or would have some idea, I would have to watch the movie for myself. The movie starts out with a really good review of "The Princess Bride" and the fact that it's the movie that makes the movie a "Disney classic", which is why I thought they would do something similar. It's funny. It shows off some of the "Disney princesses" that we all love and is pretty good.  I think the film was really funny and the ending was a pretty good idea. A guy named Ed O'Neill actually stars as the Prince and I thought he had a great role. It was a different story, though. I think he plays the older version of him and the younger version of the story would be similar to "The Little Mermaid". It's the story of the Prince who comes to live on the island, and not the one of a girl who fell in love with the mermaid.    The reason why we didn't like this movie is that the younger brother goes from being the "prince's right-hand man", like he did in "The Emperor's New Groove", and the older brother is just a typical Prince. He really just starts the story off in the same place, and then ends the movie on an island, or a palace. The island was originally going to follow the plot line of "Beauty and the Beast", where the younger Prince goes on a date with the older one, just like it did in the original movie.  So in the end, I don't see why they ended the movie in the palace, just because they are young.  The Prince, like the Princess, loves being around the people, and is not selfish at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is pretty much like the first "Night of the Living Dead" movie made in 1968, so the film "Night Of The Living Dead II" is not intended to be that. The new "Night" movie "Night Riders" is really, really, a completely different movie, at least for the first time in the U. It would seem the only thing "similar" is that the director, John Singleton, is directing it as if he was directing a "Night Rider" sequel, with a totally different set of characters in "Night Riding" and "Night on the Road". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those horror films where we see actors on a film screen, and the actors are on a DVD release with an Australian poster (if there's even a print of that DVD somewhere), or maybe they're in this in the States, I don't know. I did go into this shop with the intention of purchasing a DVD of this because I've seen one of the earlier, "true" Australian films, and if I was really desperate for one of these, I would've just walked out and purchased one. There's a lot of bad stuff in there. The story.  The story begins in the present day, in Australia, with a young woman (who looks really young, like 18) and ends with a guy in the future, a few minutes later. The guy is a loser. He tries to be cool and act like he's going to be a millionaire, he's a loser at the start. He has the typical (and stupid) guy problems, like getting girls, getting into fights, and he wants to be in a film that looks good. He wants to look like a badass. He needs to be an idiot who starts acting the part of an American.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think anyone can really go into this movie without a guide, I just happened to stumble upon it when I was on a break, it was just the one night. The first person to ever walk on the moon was American astronaut, Eugene Cernan. The second was an American astronaut named William H. (Cernan).  I remember the first 20 minutes of that mission, I was with William H, in the control room and he was very animated, and I remember some of the events he was involved in that are still being remembered. He's been a part of this mission, at least 5 times, and in those years we all were taught that the moon landing was a triumph of American ingenuity, and American technology. So I was really sad to read about what was being taught, as I didn't believe that was the case in the film, and was also pretty disappointed with the "moon walking" segments, which were a few minutes longer than the TV segment at the time of the film's original release. I don,t think that anybody needs to be moon walking, and the only one who would be moonwalking would be Eugene Cavenan. I think they are a few days away from being back on the earth. (And there's a big difference between a day and a couple of days.)  It's hard for me to understand why the first astronaut ever to be in space was moon walking because there are very few people left who were actually in the Apollo program back then, and we're all still around, and that was only the second day, or so) or why a "Moonwalk" would be the only thing shown during a space walk segment in the movie, and how they would actually make such a segment. I mean, what was the mission, and what was he supposed to accomplish? If you can call it a walk, the same thing, or just a few segments with him floating around in the air and then walking or floating on his own would be about the same. The only thing he would accomplish that he would be proud of, is that he'd make it back to the Earth to be recognized as having accomplished something, because he would have made it back, because if we hadn't, there would be nothing left to accomplish.  So just my opinion, because I don' like that segment, and it's about the first time I saw it, and now that I have seen it, I thought it was pretty
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very interested in this movie,but I think the first thing I have to do is to figure out why my husband (the director) and I decided to rent this movie when we had our family over (which is what he and I agree was his original plan for the film).  It is interesting to read the reviews. He and I have done many films together (which he was director of "The Family Plot"). This was not really that important to the film that it would have been if it was released in 1998. It is very hard to get a good audience for this movie. There was a good reason for it being released in '98. I have had friends comment on this in some of the "critics" and think that the casting was very good and it's really hard to believe I'm wasting my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really hard to watch. I'd really like to give credit to the actor for being in a foreign film, although that was the case in my previous review. I'm really looking for someone that can help me find that movie. It wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the cast of the first film, I have even been watching this film for about six months so it must have been a very short film, or else there were people in the cast, or at least I did not pay attention. It was quite interesting to watch the first "Oscar" film, people who got to know each other during that period, even if they were not the same individuals, to see how they had lived and worked together. Now, I've seen "The Best of Youth" so many times, I thought that was really interesting, because it was a short film about the life of one of the actors. In this film, it is so sad. It is truly awful. The only redeeming quality of the film was that I did catch it in the wee hours of the morning on the DVD release.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts off with the premise that the two young men are "looking for romance." The young man and I had an exchange on the internet about this film. I actually liked the idea of trying to break down romantic barriers that come up between men and women because that would be something more honest and more honest about love and about the true nature of men and woman.  This film is about two young women trying to overcome each other's feelings for each other. The first two scenes are in a hotel room and they are in love and so it could be a case of the two women trying get over their feelings of love and romance. This is actually pretty funny and would be a nice film to do something about.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A review I did about the film called the movie "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Bang" is still in print.

I can't recommend it unless you know something about the subject matter.

To say that this was meant to be a comedy is ridiculous in the extreme. It was awful. It sucked. It wasn't funny, it was terrible.  The only good thing I can say about it was that it would be funny to make fun of it for the movie-making (although I think this film would make it hilarious and hilarious-especially if this was an American production-since they'd have to make a mockery of it in order to even have a chance to redeem it.  This movie isn't a comedy. It doesn't deserve a rating of anything under an F.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As an individual reviewer, I felt that I had some control over the movie, and some control of the plot. I don't know what the other reviewers were thinking. You can't control the director's vision, your character, and if you're lucky, your actor's vision. You might get some free advice, as to how to act your character in a certain way. You know, the typical "it's gonna be wonderful, if you know how to play your part" movie, which is true. That is a different movie, a completely different movie that has never happened, and that makes you think. It has never occurred to me to really consider this movie as a true story. I am in dire need of help from people who are in my position. I give this movie 7 out of 10. But I have not the slightest idea about what to do with this film, how to handle it. It is a disgrace to every level. You will hate yourself, you will hate your friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was on a late-night talk show show, so I'm an outlier in this whole matter. This was the only movie I had seen that had been released, so it had been shown to me. There are no words to describe my pain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really love the way they create these shows and try to bring in a new generation. Unfortunately, it's the same thing as every other show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very cheesy, and the script doesn't get a whole lot more serious at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of different types of movies in the last few years, and while I've always been interested in watching some of the silent films, I've been looking to see a couple of these lately. It's still a good idea to rent them.  It would be nice to get my hands on a copy of the Vampires' Club, so I can write something negative about the Vampi-film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this movie, I was intrigued and wanted to see it again. I'm sure it would be a great movie. This film is a very slow paced, very unentertaining film. There is nothing new and nothing worth watching (unless it was really good). And when the film ends, it is not very sad at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite director is Howard Hawks. I really liked his way of making movies, I saw his films from the late 60's and 70's. I think he made more movies after the 70's and Howard Hawks did not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did rent this movie in the theater because of the star power of some of the principals involved, such as the young Kevin Kline and the young Nick Wozniak. In that regard, I wanted to rent the movie just for the fact that I have seen the movie in it's entirety. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about the same plot as many of the others.  The acting is atrocious and un-refined. The script is pure garbage. It really doesn't do justice to the film at all. There are several good-looking girls and it would be interesting to see some of the good work the cast has done in the past. If I could review this movie, I would rate it the worst film ever made. This movie really isn't even a horror movie anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What would have been a funny, intelligent and funny movie would probably be the final word for this movie. It really hurts the faith of anyone that has the faith in Jesus Christ to see this movie be made in his name.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to be very scientific, go ahead, I am not criticizing the concept of how the movie was conceived and directed. I thought it was good, that it would have some of the best actors in Hollywood, including Denzel Washington and Jeremy Northrup.  I thought the movie really suffered from not having a very good script. We see so many things that happen out of people's blind spots and that is the reason that the movie didn't make the best of it. This movie was the first time that Denzel was the central character in a movie, so the director is not allowed to give Denzel another role that he has played so much in, in a more independent role. This was something I did not really care about and was more concerned about for Jeremy Northrop because that's his character, as I would like to see Northrop take the lead.   The main reason for this movie being about Denzel is because Denzel plays the part of a cop in the first movie, and the director thought that Jeremy would be the star, a role with a big role in a thriller. This also was the reason why I was most excited about the movie because that Denzi has the lead role in this movie as the police captain, which I was also curious to see if the first part of the movie would be like a typical cop movie. The first movie was a film about how Jeremy Washington was an agent of the DEA and then later became the lead character. This time around, I would have rather seen Denzel's character involved in a true-to-life thriller, and so the movie is much like the first one.  There's an interesting look at how things were handled in the second movie, that is, how a drug lord goes through several false pretenses, and it is not really like a movie with Denzel, because, in the end, he is not involved in the drug lords life anymore, since Jeremy North has to deal with that as a cop. If Denzel had been involved in this film, his character would have been in the same kind of story where he is the head of a drug ring that is just a few minutes away from the DEA's office, in which case it would really be like an action movie, because the main role of the director has changed, and he chose to make Denzel a cop for once, so that he can make the movie more true to the premise.  Denzel and Jeremy are two
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "real" plot is that of an episode of "Full House," which is probably one of the reasons it got a TV spot for such a short time period (i.e. about 90 minutes). There are no real characters, and the acting is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit that "Pushing Daisies" (the first one) was in some ways a rip-off of "Dead Alive" and this movie is definitely not on par with the "Pleasure Town of the Pleasure King", which I will always think is one of the greatest "Dance-Off" movies of all time. As such, "Pumping Daisie" is not only a poor film but one of those "P-film-making" movies that come out every two or three years and make this one of many "P" films that are released in the United States. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was probably supposed to be like an art house film where art is the ultimate goal. So, I would suggest to watch this film if you are an art major or major student of fine arts and not to be an art critic or film student. That is the best way to view this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts off with a typical western-noir style. All of the actors were great in the early "Wild West" days. However, with the new breed of westerners, the actors should try to avoid being stereotypical.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a good movie about my friend with the acting class. I went and rented it and I had to watch a movie with an A list star that really got the best actor for the role.   I'm not surprised. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As much as I am a fan of director of the "The Piano", I am more familiar with other directors. This film is a "Cinema-Cinemar"-Film, which means it was made with the camera. I am not sure if this is a matter of the budget, the camera, the budget or both (i.e. is it just an attempt to be a "T" film). This film has a very poor story. I found it so incredibly stupid. I did not find it funny, it was not funny and it did not even come close to what I consider a decent comedy, let alone a comedy at all. I have never seen an adult film in my life where I had such a horrible time trying to understand the basic nature of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read this book from cover to cover - it is not a bad book - I am hoping the bad reviews will not influence my decision to read the book - if so, I would not recommend the book, which has its positives and is in some way a film about the lives of women.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The last time I saw this, I actually liked Paul Verhoeven's movie. I thought the first "Total Recall" movie was good enough.   This movie was just one more of an idea... The ending was so awful... The "Total recall" movie had a "happy ending" with a "good ending", while "Total-Recall" was just a sad and "funny" movie with "cheesed up" people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed the film, but in this movie, I don't think the director's vision or vision has gotten quite as right as I have. The movie was good, we had the movie's characters come together for a romantic film, and we got some really good scenes with some great actors that were doing good work in the movie, and they were doing that in the last movie. The story was about the family of the same name from the previous movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst part of this is a scene where the mother and daughter are on the couch watching "Bobby Brown" at a local video store. This is a totally different movie from the old "Bubba Ho-Tep". The old "Ho-Teph" had a similar plot with the old Bobby Brown. This new one is a completely different movie. It was written and directed by Larry Cohen, who does not have the same pedigree that Jerry Reiner had with "Buck Rogers".  Jerry Reine has since been able to make a fairly good film with Buck Rogers' "Bucky Barnes" as the director, and he didn't make a movie called "Buddy Rogers". This is the only thing I can say in the film's favor, that is the fact that he made a film of Buck Rogers, and his name is in the credits in the last scene, where he is talking with a bunch of people that worked with Reiner, in which his name was mentioned. Reiner's name is mentioned in the introduction to this film, so I think it should be mentioned that Reiner is still the director. Reine does have a cameo in "Buckle Buckle" which is the first part of the movie when the old man is talking to Reiner about his friend Buck Rogers and he's got his hat off and he is playing a minor role in the sequel.    So Jerry Reined has to have some more screen time in the end credits to show what he did with Rogers, or he will have to just show up in the beginning of the credits when he made "Buckles Buck". Reine is making a movie about this Buck Rogers character, so it isn't like the old one where he just wrote a script and directed a film about Rogers. Reines didn't want to do a sequel because he thought he wanted to go back to his "Bugs Bunny" type of movie, and to show that he liked Rogers again. He was very adamant about this and was very vocal about this being his last Buck Rogers adventure, but it is what it is. He didn't feel comfortable making another movie. He had a very hard time seeing that Reine wouldn't be just like "Bunsie" (the producer) to do it, and that the audience would get bored with it. He also felt that he wasn't being given enough screen time to prove himself worthy of the character of Buck, and would rather just go
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this with a group of my college friends. I'd like to take this chance to say to them that this movie is about to be shown on HBO or Showtime, because of the fact that it contains a lot of real people. It's not like a soap opera. There are no actors, except for the girl I'm sitting with in the movie theater right now, and her husband. She was very nice to work with, but her husband is not an actor, and neither is she. We had the chance to see him in an independent film called "The Lost Soul," and he was an actor/director.  The movie's basic premise is that a woman named Jenny (played by the girl) is going through some sort of loss, so it seems silly that she's getting sucked into a movie starring this guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a truly terrible film about an even worse film. Not only is there absolutely nothing here to even make a decent joke about. There is nothing you could even show in a movie theater. There are really no laughs here, and if you're a fan of the way Christopher Walken makes his films, there's a good chance this is even about an hour long. In all fairness, a real man, like a real guy, would have to laugh in this pit. This is all just a bad attempt to "make a movie" for those two films that were made in 1985 and 1996.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director and writer are both old, and old-school British. The plot was boring, as did all the characters, and the ending was unsatisfying.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not alone in this opinion. Some of my friends think I'm crazy for wanting to see this movie. I'm really not, it's but I am sure that my friends don't appreciate the fact that they are the only two people in town, and the way the film treats people, it was kind of like the "It's a small town after all" kind of thing. It seems to me that they're trying to be a bit "authentic". I didn't like the way it treats people at all, they should have just been portrayed the way they are portrayed in the town of New Jersey.  The way they act, it just seemed so fake. This is a movie that would not have worked in the 70's, it could not be a success for the director to put his life into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie and see that it's so far and in the world I don't see how any one in their right mind can go to it is the same as the sequel to this movie. I don the original movies are terrible but the sequel is worse than the original movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's only a movie, so I suppose you could call it a documentary or something. I would really like to see a real documentary about this "film" because I don't want to be like one of those movie people who don't like documentaries. I just want to see how this film is going to turn out, because it is really not good. If you can see this, be safe and don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to watch movies with a little bit of history and some kind of drama behind it and the movie I did was completely wrong.  I was really in shock at how I watched it and it made me really upset and that's what happened.  There are some good actors in the movie with some really great things happening in it. I'm going to keep watching it's been on Showtime. I found it on the first season and I didn't think I would find it on Showtime anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been really watching this movie for the history of the movie. So my opinion is that if you want to see a real movie, go see a true history movie. "The Devil's Advocate" is a movie that is almost entirely about Richard Scarry. I'm not really sure how it can be that a real history of it is so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My expectations are fairly high for this film. I don't mind watching a good movie. I have enjoyed watching movies like "Hoop Dreams" and "Hoosiers" and other "Hollywood" films.  It's probably my second favorite film. My "Honey Boo Boo" is "D" rated (in the UK and Australia).  The US version, which I haven't seen, is "M" rated. That means it's for kids.  If you're looking for a good time at the movies, this is it.but it's not enough to justify being in theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Logan" is a story about the return of one of the main heroes of the previous three installments, Hugh Jackman. He is one of my favorite actors, and one of few who don't have to change their roles to stay relevant with today's youth culture, so his career and the potential success of this movie depend very much on his ability to get over the script and become a spectator of his worst work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the movie when it came out. This was released as "The Incredible Melting Man", with the story being very similar.   The "man in the park" was a funny guy who didn't believe that he was going to melt, or at least make himself into a real man. Now that is his story, not mine. I was on a quest for a man's soul, in order to prove that man's are the only ones that deserve a place in heaven and I'm not sure I succeeded. It's possible to do that, as I'm sure others have done before me, and I don't have an agenda, which is why I'm taking a look at this film.  I don. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like the idea of creating a movie that would be a horror film.  Why this movie isn't just a horror flick is beyond me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very low budget (but the director did find the time to produce a short film), this movie is very poorly made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first person I saw was just a guy (a very funny guy, if I was lucky) and I thought it was a simple comedy about a guy who would have been in his late 20's. The film is based on the characters' ages and looks. What makes this movie so bad. The acting is awful. It was worse than I ever thought it would be, and it was funny to watch this film with the cast of 30 or so actors. I'm a big fan of the "Tina Louise" comedies and my friends were laughing with the actors and I was laughing with this movie. It's not good. It doesn't deserve the title of a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As much as I was looking for a film to talk about the movie I ended up with one of the more boring film that I have ever seen. The film just keeps repeating itself, I did watch the film before and I was not allowed to watch the part where the girl is being kidnapped and I'm sure this one is also going to be very different as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen so many terrible movies that I just figured that this one would be a complete waste of my time. The bad guy had a plan for this movie and even though he had to do the entire thing alone, he definitely was not his best at that role. At the beginning of the movie, his character is kind of a spoiled rich kid who seems to take himself way too seriously, and is probably just a little too self-aware. The other actors seem to be just the same way. The whole thing is a complete failure in every aspect. It makes you want to watch the worst movie ever made because this crap is just not entertaining, and the ending is just awful and the film is probably a lost cause to be made at all. You might want to do your research on this movie before watching it again. The people who made this piece of crap are a disgrace to themselves and you have no idea how much money this piece would cost you in the end. If I had to recommend it, avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was on the HBO series True Detective, the same guy is in charge of this movie, which means they're going to have the same person doing the same thing.  The movie is about a real estate developer and he's in charge.   In order to do this movie a real real estate agent would have to be hired and not some real estate guy who's in a real good position to be in.  There's a real killer behind it. It's on a real level with me, but it's just kind of out there. I feel like the real estate story is one of my favorite movies. And it didn't just come out of the air, I was watching it on HBO, that's all I've ever read or heard about it, and I don't want the story to become watered down. So this one's not just a real bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a sort of "filler", or filler movie. The movie has a somewhat "hollywood" feel and some "cheesy" music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in New York at the Film Society of Lincoln Center in the city of Lincoln. This film is shown on the Lincoln Theatre in Philadelphia (which I have not been to). It was not shown in New Jersey. This movie is a film from a time when the nation was at war with Great Britain and there are many references to what was happening around the world (the American colonies). It does not have all the "entertaining" and "humorous" references to make it a "comedy" movie and it is obvious that it is a documentary film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to watching it because it was one of my favorite movies of all time, I didn't see any movies with the actors or the quality that would warrant seeing this. They were very disappointing.  It really isn't funny, it doesn't really try to do something new with the premise, it tries to play off of it. I think I was just in the wrong place because there were some really good lines. One that's very, very funny in the scene where it's a love story between the two leads, and was just getting up to the hotel and was having an opinion or comment about the scene with them in the hotel room and the two of them actually sitting and talking. They are pretty good, and the lines would have come out right in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to see this movie, just like I had seen the "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" that's been re-released recently. I really wanted to see it's complete, I wanted to watch the director's "Escape from Ealing" with Lucas and a remake of "Ender's Game". I just didn't get the feeling that Lucas had anything to do with it. He has the best imagination, so I would have thought that he would have used this film to create a new adventure for his young son, or at least give it the same sort of character that he did with "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and create a sort of "Star Wars" type of story with Lucas. If there's any money to be made off of it, he would create a sequel, I would be thrilled to see him and Kathleen Kennedy try and create this sequel with Lucas's involvement. He would have no problem. As a kid growing up watching the movie in the cinema when it was first released, Lucas had a great hand. After all, "E.T" had been released to the public and was released, and "Vader Down" had just come out.  The story is really an original Lucas creation. You know who created "Ewoks". The only problem is that the director needed to have more knowledge of it. How to create this version of it was confusing, and the film seems to have a "Wookie" or "Yoda" feel to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was made, in part, to be a film for young people. If you've seen any of the other films in this series, you'll notice that they are made primarily for people in their 40's. I'm just curious, as it's my first time watching, if anyone has any thoughts about this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen and loved a lot of the works of Woody Allen.   For example, he directed The Elephant Man, The Philadelphia Story, and Midnight Cowboy.  The Elephant's story is really good. The Philadelphia story is about the greatest men of the 19th century, and Woody Allen does a nice job depicting these men, although he tries to hide his own and show only part of their personalities. They are the type of men who want to be recognized and honored, and who want their families and friends to know they are not just rich men who are not honorable men and people who do not keep the same values.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbuttbutbutbecause thebutbutthoughbutbutalthoughthey were a poor choice to be part of this film. For my own personal opinions of it, I really don't see the importance of a movie where Woody Allen and I have the same viewpoint. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's difficult to imagine who actually took the risk and to put in the same kind of effort, and I feel that this is the kind of film that would have been a cult if it were ever put out by a cult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was made in 1978. It was also made in the early days of "The Rock" and the Rock was in his prime during that time, and therefore would have been expected to have played the main role, as Rock would have starred in a film titled "Rock Bottom" (Rock bottom being his biggest hit at the time). There was no mention of Rock bottom in the movie. The Rock was introduced to the world as "The Big Boss" on the cover of WWE Magazine (Rock's debut issue in July 1978). He was introduced on the "Raw" television show in a WWE film in September of 1978. When Rock did his first promo for WWE in March of 1979, he was about a year younger, had long hair and was in a T-shirt and shorts, whereas now, at Wrestlemania, he looked like he had just come out of a swimming pool. The film began filming in August and ended in November of 1979 and so he had a lot of time to lose in terms of making an appearance in a wrestling film. The title character of the film was introduced in a short promotional video during Wrestlemania III on February 3, 1980, and appeared on the back cover of the "Wrestling World" magazine for his appearance at WrestleMania, making it a perfect time for the Rock to be the main attraction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was very cheesy and the ending was bad at the end. This movie was more "B" rated, and was about two hours long. And this is a comedy. Don't be surprised if you have a movie that's a full hour long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think a review would come out of it.  What an awful movie. I did get some laughs from "The Cat Returns" and "An American Werewolf in London", and I did laugh at "Cat People" and some of the other "Cat Person" movies. The only one that I was ever interested in was "The Ring" in the beginning, which was a "Cat World". This is the one and only movie, for which I have ever really ever wanted to see a "R" rated movie. This is a movie about a "L" rating. It should have gone straight to R, straight to PG-13, if not for some very important reasons, and they should really be ashamed of themselves for doing a movie like this. As an American, I have a very high opinion of the film, and I would recommend that you go see it. If you don't, there are only about 5 people that deserve to be in this "Cat world" of ours.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a fan of the original "The Naked Gun", so this will be my first attempt at a film that is based off the premise of the Naked Gun, which is the fact that the Naked gun had no purpose and was just an awful movie that I never would ever sit down to watch and I would rather watch a half hour of an old movie than have to sit through that movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a love scene between the main character (Barry) and his girlfriend, who plays his wife. Barry is the main protagonist and the love interest of the film. In the scene where he says 'I love you', he doesn't kiss her. There are a few scenes where Barry goes to the kitchen and talks to his mother, where he kisses her and says 'Good morning'.  There are other scenes where the love interests of the main characters are kissed, and the ending of this film is the same. A simple question - was there a need to include scenes where it is not supposed to happen? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping for a great film. It was one of the top 10 films at Sundance and was well-liked by other viewers. I had seen the movie twice in the theater and had seen it in the past at the London Film Festival. It may have been good to see my favorite actor and get a chance to talk to her. In a short film, you have to work so hard just to convince your audience that your character exists. The actor who played that character was pretty much invisible on-screen. And if that's what happens to a great actor, they'll never get over it, you know, they won't get used to it, and it will probably stay that way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must admit, when I watched this movie with my family, I got to laugh a little bit, with Kevin Dillon and I remember him as "Tiny Kevin." I had read a lot about Kevin Dillon, and in a documentary about his life, I had seen him as a super hero or whatever. He's not a super genius like I was led to believe he was. And while he was in college in the 70's and 80's, I guess he was an undergrad, it doesn't make him any less of a person to but for the fact that he's trying to figure things out, but he can't seem to learn. The reason being: he needs a real brain and is too obsessed with his own thoughts and theories. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did see the end of the film where a very young Michael Jackson, who is now in his 30's, was trying to help his daughter learn the art of dancing. She is the older of the two kids. So she's got some experience, and I think she is more knowledgeable about how to dance. I think that the same could be said about her sister. She could learn from Michael. But it's too late. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be one of the more original things we've seen, it wasn't really a surprise. The acting was bad and I didn't care for it. I didn. I felt a big need to laugh, cry and laugh hard. And I still found it in this film. That's good. It was pretty funny. I'd be inclined to say that it's a completely different film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the characters to be totally one dimensional. If you liked the other "T" movie you would probably like this one, or at least like the idea of it. It was like this movie had never been released, it was really a poor idea. It is not something I will recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I believe this movie was about a documentary film about the history of the band, so I hope it won't disappoint. There is much more content in the movie, withbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutthoughbutbutalthoughbutbutbecausebutbutButbutbutexcept for the documentary portion, which is not really interesting. (That's why the documentary is a companion piece of the documentary).  I think that the band should really go into a studio and get their film done again, that's why it's called "Live In Concert"  Second, I think the documentary would be a great choice to cover the historical perspective of the history behind the band and what they're up against, since the documentary has a great cast and can really paint the picture of the conflict. But since they decided to have a "novel" film about their history, then I think we really need to give some "serious" consideration and see if the movie could be an accurate reflection of the whole band history, as there is really a lot of material that hasn't been revealed (and frankly, hasn't happened). The "no novel" approach seems to be a little too "tautological", in my opinion, since they've basically been told the story of "The Band". And that's because most of the material is from the last 10 years (when the band has already been released, i.e. "The Wild Years" and "Dire Straits"). The members of the current lineup are still very new and have yet to be featured in their proper "historical" roles, which makes their roles even more important, since most people don't know who they are. I don't think it's a bad idea to go into the "history" of the Band, but at the same time, I don. And frankly, it's not just about the members of The Band, of course. It's about the "newbies", their first gigs, and how they were trying to find themselves as a band, their career in the music industry, their relationships with their fellow musicians. I think they need to be depicted as that, because it's an important aspect of the "band history" that is being forgotten by the film and is probably most difficult to cover (like the members' real first days in the band or their first concerts). Third, the documentary only covers "American" audiences, i can't believe they haven't covered some of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has the same actors as the previous movie--a man and woman playing a man and a woman playing the man. The man's character was portrayed by a man who was in the movie, so the movie didn't really feel as though it was about man versus man.   The plot was completely unrealistic--there is nothing more--it seemed like they made this movie to make the audience laugh, not to make you think. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a moral lesson about what life is all about--I couldn't even watch it until it was almost over. I had to see it for the laugh at the expense of others. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard this film was supposed to be a romantic comedy, like the 'B' in the DVD cover. It's so much I don't know what to do with it. It seems it's going to be released on DVD, although it is just a DVD-set. I don.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at the same screening as this movie on the DVD, and there were only a handful of people in this film. I know this movie will have a small cast, and hopefully I can get some people into this film, as this is the only time I know of this movie being released to the public. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the DVD of the original and actually was quite happy to have seen this movie and even wanted to see it as it was being shown in theaters. I'm a big "B" movie guy, but have a certain number of "A" movies. My main reason for seeing this movie was for my daughter, who has ADD. I don't think she is going to get this one in the theater. It is not for kids and should be made clear to the theater managers. There are a lot of "good" stories in this moviebut I think the best story is one that is told from behind the camera. The other stories aren't being shown from behind. I won't be wasting any of my time and money to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made in about four weeks. The film has been produced in some form or fashion since about 1970. The movie has to be shown to be truly complete to the credit of the "Director" and the "Producer" and not to a film made out of "half" of itself. The reason for this is that there is no "original" film on which to base this new version.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, at least I didn't start off in this movie. As I say, it's a very poor movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what they were trying to say, that little movie with me in it was so wrong, in every way. The lighting, the camera, the actors, the ending. It was so bad. This is not a movie to watch and if you like this kind of movie, you have got to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't speak for the actors, because these characters' personalities aren't what people would call real. The dialogue, the pacing and everything seems more like a typical sitcom, with the characters' eyes and expressions, and you can really sense the actors' pain in having to write such an awful film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am really surprised at how many friends of mine actually recommend this movie as a great piece of work. Maybe my friend had the opportunity to see it as a movie that was released on VHS and so they really wanted to be in on the "first look" of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good friend of mine (who I'm sure can provide some closure), who went to film in Chicago, said this is what he saw. He was absolutely right! The Chicago Film Fest was in the Chicago North side, so it's possible they could have gone to the North side of town and then found it there. The other festival was in a more industrial section of town, so they would have seen it then, or even worse, had they not found it here. The film also has a plot that tries to be "serious", I'm just going to make one of my friends who was in that film say the same thing: "The film is really about an average guy who is trying to get into college, so I really think it's meant to be about average people." The film is just a horror movie. It's not a true "noir". I don't know exactly how this happened, and even if I did, the director was only a few years out of college at the time, so he probably had my film for reference when he wrote this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie about five minutes ago. I can't say for certain. If you watch the entire movie, it's your loss. If, like the guy in the video, you were hoping to see some super-hot blonde (which you can find in any mall), then you were in for a surprise, and if you had any sense of self respect, you would get out of this movie. And, I know I'm a girl, this may have just been a "girl-oriented movie" (though, the movie was marketed as "Sexy Horror" for the record's sake, though, so, I guess they can't go around saying the same thing). A girl can be in an undress at the end of the film, and I guarantee you that this movie was made for a very, very niche audience. It was made because of the popularity of the "Witches" movies, and so, you will see some very, erotically-dressed actresses, very, incredibly sexualized women, and a few very, VERY risqué women. It might have been the only woman I'd seen naked at a party at my old college. There are more than a few women in the movie, who don't make an effort to hide what they are, and just plain out naked (as a matter of fact, on the cover). If you are into that sort of thing, you're in for an unpleasant surprise, in my opinion. The movie starts with a woman, who gets naked at the beginning of the movie. It starts out with a man, who has her naked in the bedroom and then, after he has sex with her, is shown undressing her, while she's in her underwear. It's just the two of them, naked and in bed. The sex scenes were not particularly interesting, either. As the movie progresses, the camera doesn't linger on women, who are getting undressed, you never see any of the naked women being punished for their transgressions, and the director just seems to be wanting to make the movie as sexual as possible. The ending, which is the best in the Witch's sequel, is simply a bit of an ending, just like all of the other movies. The rest of the scene, in which a man finds out that the woman in the shower is topless, is just plain awful. If it wasn't for the fact that I'd just finished watching Witch, and was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about the cast members of the show, so the characters are nothing but archetypes. I don't know what kind of character is that kid with the glasses and the curly blond hair. His character was completely devoid of any charm and any sense of intelligence and he is just plain annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It has bad acting, bad effects, bad music, bad editing, bad and bad.  This movie is so horrible. The movie should have never been made, so don't waste your time on this movie. It isn't worth it, and if you give this movie a try at least give it as an excuse to rent it on a DVD, because you have no idea what you are going to do with it. I would say this is the worst film that was ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.butbutbutBUTbutbutyet itbutbutbecause of thebutbutso-butbutchered androgynous "male" body figure,which also has the unfortunate looking female body figure that can't bend to the right (if that is not the case, please contact IMDb/Google). This movie is very hard to look at and I would advise people to rent this movie or see it on TV. If you plan on seeing this movie, don't recommend that. Don't even rent this. The DVD comes with a great special feature, which you should see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this with my best friend.  We were supposed to like it. I loved the first movie with Kevin Costner and the second one with John Lennon. It had the first two movies to make people familiar with the characters, and I thought it would be really cool to have a third movie just for those characters, then have it again.  I don't know who is paying the people who are in charge of this movie. The movie is the same as the first one, there are too many scenes, it has to be a really good budget. It has to follow the first film, and that's all I can say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a movie of some sort, so it's not one of those mindless crap movies like some have made it out to be.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie has a great concept of "the lost city of Atlantis". I am hoping that, after reading the comments about this movie, that it has a similar concept to the first film: the lost city Atlantis. As far as the movie is concerned, I am wondering if it was made for the first movie or for a different movie altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the series was good because of the cast of the series. The cast of this series is the same cast of a few episodes back and they are in the same location as before. In this one they are not paid for their work, and they can't get a union. They have no guarantee and have no pension. Some of the actors do not make money even when they have an important role. Some have lost their home or car.  This movie is about survival and not about survival horror. If a person is to survive, they should stay away from this movie, I recommend you to rent or rent something that is a true survival movie, like I was able to do from the DVD box cover, or something like The Devil's Playhouse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film was good, and I was actually an action fanatic. As I recall, I knew what the plot was. I have always been a fan of martial arts films, and like to watch them at home with friends. I love the films "The Karate Kid", "Legend of Chun Li" and "Shaolin Soccer Kid".  I've always loved "The Green Hornet", "The Legend of Chun-Li" and others. I've also seen "The Rockford Files" several times.  All three films are great in their own right, and they have been done several times before. The second film, "The Blue Steel", is also very good, especially in the final fight. This one has been butchered by the makers.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was my second movie. I really have to give my second opinion and that of my fellow cast members. As the director of this movie, I would like to have the decency to tell the public that this movie is going to be a very honest story. But at the moment it is the story of a man and a woman in love but with but one person in love who is falling into the trap of the love ofbutbutbutBUTBUTBUTbutbut. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For the record, I'm not against people that watch this movie. I love film-watching and this film is not without merit.butbutbutbecause of the way it got made. The film starts with a small group of friends that, on their way to a movie-theater, meet a small girl named Sophie. Sophie is played by Giselle Moreau. She's the daughter of one of the producers, but is in fact, a child actress who was hired to be a child for the movie. They made their way out of the theatre where Sophie was about to appear at the end of the movie and met Sophie in the street.  It was at the theater where they hired Sophie to act and Sophie had a red hat on, which was used as her first scene (as you can see on this website) in the film. It was her first day of school. And she still wears that hat in the original film. I don't know why they would hire an independent movie to make a children's film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to write and see films. I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I thought it was a good idea. The director of the film is no match for the two lead characters (at least) in the film. Not funny at all and a disgrace to the movie that I saw it on HBO. The guy is a good actor and I thought I knew this guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am pretty sure it is the case that it's been shown to thousands and millions of people over the past several years. I am a big fan of this show.but I'm also a fan of reality. In this movie, the writers were trying to make a film about what they had done to so many people in other films - to me, it's a really poor film. If you go into the theater with the intention of having a great, entertaining movie - don't watch this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't get the title or the movie on video. I really didn't know what the movie was going to be like.  I have always liked this movie and it is one of the best movies of 2001. But sadly I found out that this movie could be done much more cheaply than it already was. This is because the movie must be very well done, or else we will have a lot of actors out of work and then we can't really make the movie as short and cheap.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not one to watch these movies and watch them on DVD's of my kids and then later read them. I found out about a month ago that I couldn't watch these films, so, I have to write down about what I have seen and read. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's really a shock to find myself still on this film. The director has taken himself off the screen and that's it. It's just that, and it's bad enough to make you laugh and watch bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was written as a comedy in Los Angeles for American audiences, and the reason that this movie was directed here is because some producers here in the Philippines were involved in this movie. There were two main people involved in writing this movie, one being the writer of "Anak" and another being the film's editor, and I guess I was one of them.  In the course of writing this film, the producers of this movie tried to get away with the idea of getting away with this movie just as "Anok" did. They have been in the film business for more than a decade. We're not getting a movie here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After seeing this movie, I think it's fair to say that, with a certain amount of luck, a movie is like a rock. It's got this weird 'buddy' feeling to it, and the most famous rocker, Kurt Cobain, was always a rock star. Now, Cobain was a weird guy, and he hated rock and roll, and this movie isn't about that. There are certain rockers in the movie, people who are supposed to be Cobain's role models and idols, and they are portrayed as so bad and horrible, so terrible and bad, that you get the feeling that they were made to do this movie in the first place. I mean, look at this mess. This movie has a lot of dumb rocker chicks, dumb rockers with rockers' hats on, a lot like the 'Beverly Hills Cop' movies. It has rocker-chick-rockers-rocker-girl-rock, rocker rockers-chicks rocker and rocker boy-chic rockers, rockers who are rockers and rockers girls, rock rockers rocker. It really is as if they were trying to capture a mood in a movie, and make it into a 'feel good' movie.  Kurt Cobin, as much as he was a rocker in real life, had this really horrible life before he came on the scene in Cobain Nirvana and is portrayed in the film as just another 'rock' fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a little difficult to see who was who. In fact the guy who played the 'bad guy' looks like a guy from another movie who does that role. Maybe the original "Bad Guy" was a "bad guy" for this film. The good thing is, I don't remember this one. The 'bad guys' were really scary and I recommend the remake of the 'Night of the Living Dead' where it came out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite movie is this one with good actor like Ben Affleck and wonderful director. But the new director came onto the scene and decided to ruin this one. They put on a play on this play and put on this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original series was the standard for a 90's action flick (with a gun to my head) and this new series features a black man shooting a black woman.  The first series was based on an action comedy with a black guy and white girl (with white guy and black girl, so-called), and the second series is based on a science fiction/fantasy film (with black guy, white girl).  The black man does appear onscreen as the main villain, and I believe that he is still one and appears in this new show. He is a villain.  And there is another black guy named Eric Brooks. He plays the antagonist, so he is a secondary villain, though I haven't seen this new version of the show yet.  It may have changed a little bit since I last saw the show, in the second season, and so the villain is called "Eric Brooks" now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was just released. My curiosity was piqued. I've heard about the movie for quite some time. Some people just saw the trailer and don't know who it is or don't care about it. The trailer isn't that bad or that bad for people to see it either. That's what was on it at the box office. They're just not aware of the movie and the ending in the United States. What happened in the end was really kind of a twisted idea. It's not one that you see in the movie. It is a really messed up end to the movie, and the last half of it. It really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "What a good movie" was the last movie in which this was being released, so I'm a little surprised by the number of people who reviewed this and thought it was good.   The movie is not really the best movie to ever be made, it's just a bad one that was shot. The cinematography is really bad (in the theater, not on TV), there are terrible actors in this movie, it is bad in every way imaginable. And worst of all, it really makes you not want to watch this movie because it is awful in the movie theater, especially with an audience.  I was going to say this was like "The Third Wave" and it's the "B" word in the film review community...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we saw the first movie, we were entranced by the fantastic movie that was "The Invisible Ray".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did not think I was in for this type of movie at all, and my first thought would have been that it would be a movie I could rent at VHS store (with the tag line, "This is the type of film I could watch with my friends at a VHS film). After seeing it was an awful and incredibly terrible movie with absolutely nothing to recommend it, that VHS that was made from the original "Mystery Man" or any other DVD copy of that movie in the world, the original Mystery Man had a cult following, it was a cult film that was very hard to find, and it really just makes a mockery of the original. Even the name of the movie "Mysterious Man" rings true to me because of that. I'm so sorry for those of you who paid good money to see it, and those of the "new" Mystery Man on the market. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I'm one of those people who enjoys bad movies because of the laughs, just because of having to make them. This one makes you wanna slap yourself (it's really bad!). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I lived in the area and was on a high alert at the time, it was obvious to those around me that this was a very low budget film with little support, and it was a complete failure to capture any sort of feeling or quality for the film.  The scenes of the film are simply shot and filmed from start to finish, and in my opinion, all of the characters are either dead, dying, or dead from the moment they are conceived.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find that "Romeo and Juliet" is not only completely confusing, but actually pretty painful to watch.  It is as if they had done it for the first time, and so the ending really leaves you hanging and unsure of what will happen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made in Hollywood in the year of 1972. Since 1972 was around the time when the Manson killings happened, the plot is completely unbelievable. I'd go into a bookstore and see if I could find a copy of the book. The main reason for this movie is for shock value and I've never seen anything that would shock me in 1972.  The Manson killings are the only thing that comes close. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was supposed to have been a horror film that is supposed to be a horror sequel with some special effects, special effects and special effects people. It was released to the public on Friday, March 1, 1996 and they watched it for free on Cinemax which is why it is entitled "The Horror Classic." It is hard to believe that it is a horror classic. And I have seen many more horror movies. And no matter how you look at it. The film is horrible, disgusting, completely over the top, and it's got to be the only reason I can watch this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing that should have killed the movie happened (I got no sleep), so it's hard to give an opinion on this, except what I saw on the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was given a 10 minute warning when it was released. This film is over 20 minutes long, although the movie was not a bad film. The characters arebut are boring and the plot is poor. It's so bad.  The characters in the movie are so dumb. There's really no way a person could even function without help from a psychiatrist (like the kid in "The Cat in the Hat" or something stupid like that).  I'd be embarrassed to be in a role in a movie where someone gets into a movie about it being a "great movie." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea what made this movie. My husband and I watched it on HBO (an hour) and it was the first episode of the show. The entire show is about two cops fighting over a guy in the desert and no cop does anything useful except for an interview with a guy who was arrested. It could have been made into an hour long documentary, and even then it wouldn't be much. The whole thing is about a cop in a desert. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of the first few movies, when I was 17. As you know, it was a love story between me and my character (Bette Davis). I'm not a girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I am a woman. I thought I could easily see how I could, as the film was made in the 1970s. The films are all made in Hollywood studios, as I was only able to see it in my house in Connecticut. It's all the same film, as they have the same people making them. It was not a question that I had to do a lot of research about this, so there may have been some of it.   Secondly, I don't know if I'm a fan of "The Hangover" or "The Last Hangover," so I may be biased, but they were both films that didn't get the same treatment as this one. I haven't seen the films and I was looking forward to watching them, and was looking for some more film and thought they would be my only chance to see them.  Finally, the film is made in 2 or three days, and you have to go in for that reason. The film is all about making the hangover into a complete experience, but there isn't enough of it, because it's all about that first one day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When a child gets sick with food, that child should be taken to the hospital and given food that is both safe for the child and tasty! The "diet plan" is the reason we went to see this film. When we went back, it was no wonder why!  I'm a very independent woman who just doesn't go along with the "doll" mentality that Hollywood wants to force upon me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a "documentary" that is not really true to reality. They put out an ad on TV that shows them and I walking in the park to be more accurate about how I walked in the woods, then they have made a movie about the reality. It is about the bad guys walking in their normal park attire (which they were). They are just going to get themselves arrested.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts in a beautiful, tropical paradise. It is the scene of paradise and paradise only. The story starts in the mid-section with two black guys, two white guys, and a Mexican girl, in a tiny apartment on a Mexican side of town and goes on to a place called Chihuahua, and then to Chihuahaquillo, just north of San Francisco. The characters have a Mexican background and they are all Mexican-American, but they aren't Mexican. In fact, at first, I thought this would be a very black film about Mexican characters, just like "El Norte". The director was kind enough to point that out and clarify that his characters were actually originally from Mexico, but this film was meant to be a comedy. Why don't we just laugh about Mexican stories, since they are not that bad.  It's kind of sad to see an independent film of this caliber that has been so unfairly scrutinized. I don't really want to spend a lot of money and time and go see this film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen some other reviews where people might say "Oh, this movie is awful" or "Oh no, the movie was so bad", oh man, if anyone who's ever had a TV in front of you, or a movie, or had a movie in front you knows that you'll have an opinion of something pretty bad, but then, I would recommend that people give this movie the benefit of the doubt, maybe it'll get better. After all, the story and concept were not bad at all, however, I think that the special effects were pretty low budget. It's really hard to make out faces and all of the faces look convincing. There are also several scenes that are so low budget, and I think it makes it difficult for the movie to have a proper emotional effect. It gets boring and boring at times, and it just makes me want to quit on the whole experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not one to watch bad movies (as with many others), so I thought that watching it for the benefit of others would not be a good idea, because I have seen a lot of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very happy with the performance of George C. As George's character, his name came out on the screen, and in fact I got up the following morning to watch the first episode of the show - "Citizen George C" - I was watching the original series (the series which started it all) with George C, and I had to wait for it was still on television - and I wasn't even on the air. This is the first series of the television show, and the series is still airing on television! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a really nice, quiet, sweet movie--and I can see that some of the film's makers were trying to get it to be a really big film--and then they probably weren't really able to get in their budget because of their own decision making.  I would love to make a movie with my own resources. I'm still looking for a movie that is made in the United States and directed by an American. I know this movie doesn't have any big names, or I guess is really just a comedy, I'm sure there are many people who are really excited to see it. I would just like to give a little more of an idea of what the budget of this film was. I did see it on a website or the movie was on DVD or whatever, and I was hoping for the highest possible budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a very poor attempt to make the movie.  I gave this movie a 4 for my wife and my dog and my daughter watched it on the same night as I did. I would give it a 2 out of 10 for a 4 out of ten. The movie starts out in a very good light and the cast does have a nice story to tell about a tragic love story. In the middle of the movie I saw two scenes. One was of two people crying for 15 minutes about this tragedy and I remember the first scene.  The other scene was an eight minute scene. After seeing that I can't see how this movie can possibly ever be a masterpiece. And the final scene of the film is the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got a free DVD of this, and it had a short film of about 20 minutes. I don't know what the other guy had but it looked like a simple crime thriller. I'd like to know how these people found out about the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just hope it was an isolated case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a comedy, I have never been a serious comedy buff, i was not interested in it. I am not sure if it is the director or the writer, but this film had all of it's worst elements, I was not amused. It just wasn't funny, the ending was awful and I don't understand the reason for it. It wasn't as bad as the terrible film from the end of "Holes", it is just an awful movie that doesn't make you want to watch it. This movie was funny, and funny enough, the movie had an ending that really had a message for the director and had some good messages, the end could have been a film that really made this movie the next night. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The guy in the movie is the director of "The Man Who Killed Kennedy" (Robert McNamara)  And if you know the history of the world, you know McNamara and you know he did the killing on September 1.  And there are only two possibilities here: (1) He's made a sequel to "The man who killed Kennedy" and (2) he's making a remake of a "Man who killed Kennedys" movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite actor was Frank Sinatra. Frank Sinatatra's songs were all that I was looking for in this movie.but they were not the same as Sinatra's and the same songs were used in both films. That was a shame because Sinatra sang many, many more songs than this one, Sinatra is a master of song and his tunes are used in countless songs around the world. And his singing talent should have been showcased in the movie.  Ibut Sinatra was the first choice to play Sinatra in "Deathtrap" and was given his shot at Sinatra for Sinatra to sing a few songs in "Sinatra: Hollywood". But if Sinatra had been given the chance to sing in this film he would have been given a blank canvas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I find myself reading the comments of other movies. They all had the same feeling, as if I had walked into their dressing room for the weekend. My wife, on the other hand, would not go near a movie like this, as she has already had one too many 'drama' movies, and for the most part, people that are just plain people don't seem to understand the concept of 'love'. It's not a movie about love, it's a movie for some people and if you're an old fashioned person with your heart open, then I would suggest you to keep that in it's entirety. There's nothing for people that aren't that open to a movie that doesn't have that feeling.butbutbutBUTbutbutyet (but no movie is going to be a 'love story') and I don't know if this movie is meant to be 'art-house'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was my first movie that I thought it was the funniest thing ever.  I was looking forward to seeing this as a comedy. I know comedy is fun and it is something that makes you want to laugh. I was so bored I was laughing hysterically. And the girl was pretty pretty. So I would recommend this movie to those who want to see some comedy to see the movie version of the movie "A Million Kisses" where I think it had some laughs and a different story with a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think people say the movie is not the same thing as my character. I think that it's just my perspective of it. It's a movie with a bunch of characters who are played by the same person, so there's a bit of a cliché factor to some of the characters. That's because the movie was made in the late 80s when most of the actors in the movie had long hair, so some of them are quite old.  It's kind of cute that a few of them were older. (Toni Collette)  It is not as old as, say, "The Color Purple" which was made by the late 90's or as cheesy as most of them look.  I don't think it's a good idea for my character to go down the road that I'm going to be in the next year. I don the movie in my college class. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was horrendous and there were so many scenes. The ending of the movie was predictable and stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's funny that I laughed at when I was on a comedy talk show...that is, if it wasn't for the fact that it makes fun of people who do not like themselves. This movie goes out to try and force people to laugh at it. I don't understand why, as if it didn't, because we've got to watch it again on TV, and then go and see the movie.  I found it to be...disappointing. The reason for this is because the movie tries to make you laugh. The guy is an ex-professional, and so was I. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not trying to be harsh or critical or anything. I am an amateur film reviewer who was in a rush to see this as well, and that's how I judged this movie.  It was not the best film ever. It had a lot of violence (the kind that made me jump out of the theater when I saw Fight Club) and a bunch of explosions. I loved the first one. I thought that director Tim Robbins had done a great job with Fight Club and had the best taste for film, directing, and directing the action-oriented film.   This movie was completely terrible.  The premise, and I cannot express this, was ridiculous, and it was so unbelievable that this was a good idea. It was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A" film is still the one with the big production team that has done so many great movies with good actors. This was another movie for us to be an "A film" which is the lowest budget ever made. This is not at all a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit that the show does make some jokes about my favorite comedians, who are Bill and Jerry Seinfeld, who've just wrapped up their fourth season of the show, which had been released on Showtime at the same time as this new show. They're funny people, and I'm sure Jerry Segal, who had been on my show when Jerry was younger, would love to talk about some of these new actors, which I'd just like to have an interview with. They've done enough television in these two shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the way they got out of the Titanic and their adventures on the island.but unfortunately, we don't get to see how they found a way to get back there. I didn't like that they killed the "lone survivor". It was the most brutal part of the movie. I don't think it's very shocking to say that they were in the habit of killing the "man in the room". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if it was the producer, or the director, but I was one of those lucky souls who got to watch this when it came out. I was lucky enough to see it in a theater, and then it came onto the video. If you're going to watch it on video, you're pretty much screwed. There is a whole lot of money in this film. It's really important, and I just want to see that there are people out there who are willing to go out and make this film, but it just wasn't made the same way. If this film could go two hours and change, that is really something.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no redeeming aspect. And I didn't like it when I saw it as it was back in December.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not the biggest movie fan when "The Third Man" came out, nor was I a huge fan of Cary Grant, who had a very big role in "The Last Movie". He's the one that gets the most screen time in this one, with Grant being just the second choice. This movie just is, and I had a hard time taking it. It's been a couple of days since I finally saw it and I think I just have an urge to watch it again and see what I think about it. And I'm really glad to hear that you're doing another movie. I'd just like to know what the hell this movie is supposed to be, is all I have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a reason why the producers are calling this a "previous movie" or "original" film. This film is a piece of "movie history" with a bad ending. I've read some of the comments here and I don't really feel the need to post this here. If you're looking for "previously," I highly recommend you read this, or do it for yourself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is set in England. It tells us that it is about a man named Michael Caine. The plot is a lot like a movie of the 90s, in that it tells the life of an ordinary man in England, which makes him a regular guy, living with his girlfriend and wife, and then living with other people, but at the same time the movie is completely different. Caine is portrayed as a person who has been given a life sentence, which explains why he looks like a convict; and he's got a really bad luck, or luck on a bad roll in a life-and-death situation. His best friend and best ally is an old man named Kevin Kline, who is in the middle of a movie called 'Trouble in Paradise' (1996). He's a famous British director; he's been nominated for an Oscar; he won an Oscar for 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest', and the two movies are close together.  The first movie was set in a country house of one sort and the second was set on a farm. In 'The Caine Mutiny', Caine plays the hero's wife in 'Tumbleweeds' (2000); and this movie is a thriller, which means it takes place in an apartment and in the midst of a bunch of people. There are a lot of explosions and explosions are usually associated with British movies, but the one involving a plane in the climax is completely ridiculous; and the story is totally unbelievable. I really couldn't find one single thing that makes it worthwhile. This is a pretty much a B- movie with an extra special DVD extra that comes with this one, and I am really sorry to the people who have paid for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The end of the movie will have a very significant impact on the plot and, more than likely, will change everything. It won't be a simple film, that was intended to be done in three weeks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is very low budget, and the cast really does not deserve this film or for any money to be spent on it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To answer the question "Why did I watch this film," I was pretty tired by the time I started to watch the film, and the second film is about a little bit of a slumber party and it's also about a few of the cast members getting on and off the boat. This film is a bunch of junk, bad actors and a terrible movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an extremely low budget film, with a low budget of around $4. The actors do not have the skill to act well in a movie. They look like they're trying to hide their faces. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie very similar to the last, which was called "The Man from Mars" and another short-lived movie that was called, "The Men from Mars".   The movie is so horrible I can't recommend it to anyone that could be a family member, it was awful, at least by my standards. It is so bad you think it is not real, it could be made funny and with good lines. I mean, don't even go to look for a DVD, I've heard of people getting a $5 DVD for it, I really hope they have no regrets. I've never been more sorry for a movie in my life. I'll give it a grade of F, I was going to grade on how good I think it's going to make the movie. It's got really bad humor, bad humor. It was horrible! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's the point of that movie? Why not just watch it and leave it be. I was disappointed and didn't enjoy it at all. I thought it was a very good movie, and you'd probably expect it to be. Why am I giving this movie a 1 rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was a pretty good piece, there are a number of actors and actresses who've worked with Michael Jackson. You had a number who worked with Jackson, the late Michael Jackson, and the late John Lennon, and even one or two who worked for Jackson.  One of the primary reasons that this film was made was because Michael Jackson was willing to support the film. It was a great tribute, and a good look. The same thing happened with his daughter. But as far as the actual movie is concerned, it's pretty disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was not so much about the lives of the people living in that town.  The townsfolk were not seen, and it's not really known where the townspeople went to live, and why they weren't seen was pretty strange. What I do know is that I did find out that they did have a small army of troops stationed there (though there weren't many troops there).  The guy who directed this film was named Jim Thompson (who made the first film).  He directed the first "Tombstone" (also about an army, I think) and that film was the best that I knew of, and had some great action scenes, and I was curious to see how he was going to direct a film with all this new stuff.  It is pretty much a one man show, with Jim Thompson directing it, and after the first two movies he did the best, directing the first one and directing the second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if this film was made by the usual suspects (or a bunch of other indies, or was a 'proper' indie film or what, but it is not my film. The plot, dialogue and the quality of production are sobutbutbutyet. My first thought was that 'indies' are the kind of movie that would be directed by such 'big name indies' who have a lot of budget and support and who would then be able to get to the best actors and the most talented actors in town and so I'd have to be able tell you that it was a low budget movie in a big city. I feel bad for the guy who has to come up with a good reason to get a date with me. The guy who directed this film is not a director that's familiar with indie cinema (or anything else for that matter). My opinion on the movie isn't going to get better, it's pretty obvious that this film has been released to the'scene' of the film festival circuit (or what little else was happening at the time). I'd much rather watch a great film with good actors who are just plain good actors that actually get to know their character and who then find out how this bad guy falls in love with the bad girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really bizarre movie with a bunch of strange characters, such as a bunch who play with a pair of wooden chopsticks and play "Chinese chess" or something like that. They play one game of "Chinese Chess" and then play a whole series of games "Chinese." The "Chinese" character plays a game called "Red Dragon Chess" -- which I won't go into detail about. There is a lot more information on this subject available than I'd care to read about here in a magazine. A guy named "Bao" (the most prominent member of the "Chinese community in the U.S.") was actually "dressed up" as "Chow Yun" in a promotional video for this movie. This may be an attempt at humor on my part. It was actually one of my favorite "Chinese-comedy" movies, with its "old" jokes and Chinese-style slapstick comedy.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been to a movie like this where the actors are the only one who are supposed to be in the same room together and in the "brief" time I was watching this movie, I did not even get a chance to see what was on the IMDb about the movie. What am I supposed to feel about this movie? A bad movie about a film about a good film.

The same could be said about the other two.butbutbutBUTbutbutthebut is the only one that comes with a price tag of anywhere near $2 million.  As for the third and fourth ones, I think I'll leave that alone until someone comes along and asks me to put the "real" Bay Bridge Hotel on the market.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't a disaster.but it's not a success either.  The main reason for this movie's release was that it was being done in Canada by the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and that it would give us a fresh perspective on things. That would be a good reason to watch this movie before going to the cinema (which is why it is only being released on DVD). A fresh perspective could really help the movie's credibility. The movie is not supposed to be a documentary. The director had no clue what he was doing and didn't have a good grasp on the subject matter.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not the first time that I watch this movie. It's my third. I haven't seen the second one. I'm afraid to say that I'm already feeling the effects of the first one's post-production.  In a nutshell, this movie is like a horror "film" for kids. I've seen the effects that are made for children, in a horror film. (The "Tetris" series is a true horror film.) And that doesn't mean that the kids in this movie are made of cardboard (although that's the case for me). As for the effects. They're horrible. If I wanted to watch a "real" horror film, I'd watch a movie with the actors (yes, even with the effects) for the entire film, so I can't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't find a single movie in this world that I can recommend to you. I don't have a clue what it was like when this movie came out. It wasn't reviewed or screened by the media, and I'm not exactly sure of who I was watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, it was never released on DVD. It has a rather short list of titles (not even the ones in the library). The title was just the only thing I could find that said something like "The Big Red Giant".   Second of all I did know the title, I was interested in the connection between this and the earlier movie.  I actually purchased a copy of this movie on video years ago on VHS, and was surprised at how old it was. I didn't realize that it would be released on video, and it was actually available for home viewing back then, and so was the DVD release of the "The Giant". I remember the original version came out in 1994! This was released in 2000.  And, if you are curious, you can compare the dates of the two titles! It's not that this is a bad film or bad picture, just that it was only released in the U.S. and has nothing to do with Canada or anywhere else in the world. I thought the "Big Red Giant" had some interesting connections that would be interesting to comment on, especially since the movie was titled after the giant's actual appearance in the Great Lakes region of the Great American Desert. Perhaps the Big Red would have been a bit more appropriate for its release here. And I have a feeling that some Canadian Big Red fans might get an answer to this issue, as well.  Third, I do not believe that I am alone in my view that giant robots are more scary than giant robots. Some people would say that giant robot movies are just a bunch of action figures, or are just the work of "Hollywood special effects". They are not really "action" films! I don't really want to get into a discussion on what is the "right" or "wrong" with action-driven films, though I will say that there is a sub-genre of them. There was another movie that was called "The Return of the Giant" that was actually just another sequel to a film that was directed by Wes Craven, The Giant was not, in fact, a movie that featured a giant robot as one of its major protagonists. That is all.   This movie is also a rather boring film. Some of the effects are pretty cool. Giant robots just sort of jump around, fly about, shoot out huge missiles and all that. There is some great action in this kind of movie. Just look at "Return of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen The Wizard of Oz, and loved it. I thought this would be just a good little holiday special about a little girl and her pet dog. It's been released as such, with an R rating in the US, and in Canada, and as a "family movie" with little kids. My friends and I thought that the idea of the movie would be to have a bunch of kids who would love to go out and have fun, and maybe they'd go on to see The Wizard in the theater. They'd get to know some of the actors in this movie, the director, and that would allow them to form a bond and develop a relationship but we'll have to see how things work out, the movie's release date is November 17, and I don't want to give away too much of this movie. I've been able to watch this movie with a bunch and still give it a grade. I recommend you go to see it with a group of people, and watch it with all your senses, as not just to see what a bunch kids are up to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a big fan of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a lot of research on the subject, this is probably the only movie about UFOs that will be shown to a lot more people, and I guess it's supposed to be a horror movie, and it is. I don't like the idea of a bunch of aliens trying to find us, and that's a movie about aliens trying find the real world, which is much more fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge movie buff, and I've seen every movie ever made, I had hoped to be able to watch this movie to be a guest and take in the atmosphere and the excitement of it. It's about a 10-minute movie that was supposed to be for children, and that's not to say I didn't want to see this movie in theaters, but it was really really a movie about the writer and I was totally uninterested in any of the characters, the writing, the acting. The movie was so lame, so bad that I really can't believe it's meant to be serious. It was so badly done. It would have cost about $5 to watch the entire movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very poor effort. The only good thing that I could find was the fact that it may have been a true story. I really hope I don't get it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very impressed with the original TV series, as were most people. I didn't think the remake was the same show, just different actors with a different background. As such, it's hard for me to feel anything but ambivalent about the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so unbelievably poor, that it's absolutely unbelievable.  No amount of pretentious "artistic" movie reviews can make any excuse for this, or any excuse to even consider buying this DVD. And I'd like to just warn people about this film - if this was about a "art film" it would be just a sad movie about a sad man - so I'd hate to recommend anyone that would like to see this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion is that it's bad. I liked this movie but I didn't think it was perfect. The best thing is I thought it would have had the best ending when I watched it on television and when I saw it on video, it wasn't in the middle of the two, but not the best film ever. The only really good thing in the film was the scene in the first half of the film which was in the hotel lobby which was a good one. I thought I could give it a bit of a push by showing the movie in a hotel that was shot in the early 70's. I just don't know what could be the right ending or the most good ending. I mean, the guy played by Steve Carell is great and he really did an excellent job. I've seen the film on VHS and I thought he's got an excellent eye. It's funny, funny enough, and the guy is pretty good at acting, he's not bad. His performance in the scene where he was trying to convince the guy with the glasses to buy his house was a funny one.  I thought the same guy played a pretty good part in the third film when he was helping Carell deal with his mother-in-law and also he was just really nice to him. He should really get some screen time and I hope that Carell's character is able to see something similar here.  The movie is basically just a sequel. It had the good ending in the last film with Carell as a young man that was going to live with his aunt and uncle and care for his mother and so forth, which we never got. And the movie ends with Carel and his wife trying to get the family farm in Virginia and he's looking for some way to get back to work. So the characters are just kind of drawn in for the sake of the ending, and you can tell by the look of them.  Steve Carels' performance is about what he did in "Office Space" so there's no real difference and he has always done a good job of making his character more believable than that of Steve Careell's, so his performance is a lot better than Steve Careller's. His facial hair is really good and he is cute and he doesn't look like he's been in a cartoon.  But he just looked like he was bored or really bored during the movie. He looks kind of stoned and tired (I didn't see it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film is not really a classic.  The second film's poster is more appealing (i have seen it before). I really enjoy the ideabutbut it would be great to see a couple of real movie people sitting down with the director and discussing their work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was meant to be a commentary on "The Great American Movie: The Best Of Everything" (a TV special on "American Movie Classics"). The great American movie: The Good Times are long gone, and this movie is simply the last in a series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed the original version of this movie. It was a simple comedy that was made at the University of Texas, about people who lived on campus. So I thought that was a fairly good comparison between the college and high school versions of this film.  The high school version seems to be based on a book, although I cannot read it, and I guess the school version was made by somebody who could. So it may have some resemblance to that, but the film itself is an independent effort with very little support from any of the Texas high school or college networks. It is not clear why they would have anything to do with the high school and college film festivals, which have a significant component in college students. Also, there is no money for any significant publicity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I sat down to watch this film, I was hoping to see the director's vision for a film about a young, beautiful woman who could take on her male counterpart and defeat her to the death in a beautiful dance sequence in the streets of New York City; and this film was a sad, depressing look at a female lead who was "blessed" by the male lead.  And, yes, this film is about a woman's life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a good-natured review of this movie. There is even a very good ending in this movie that does contain a nice ending for the main character, who ends up on a beach in the end. But it is not until the next scene, when the two leads are on a bridge and they are getting back on the train and the two girls are getting on that scene that the story really begins.  It's no wonder that the director felt the need to start the film by telling the story of the two characters in this film, since they had no experience with it, since the movie's director, director of photography and composer all had to learn how to tell the story. The result was a film that was filmed very, very cheaply. The movie starts with three great sets from one of the great cinematographers of the 60's, Francis Coppola, and they were used in the film. In the last scene when they arrive on the beach, one of them shows a very bad, extremely poor quality. The only thing about the beach scene that was actually in the book was the scene on the sand, which I didn't even want to use. And that scene has something good in it, that shows how the characters are on the shore. This one isn't even close to being perfect in the movie.  The story does take place in a beautiful environment, in a small island and with a beautiful cast of pretty people, so I am sure that there will be plenty of good material about the island. It certainly wasn't the best island in the world, it's just very different than the beach setting in the previous movie. All of the characters, especially the lead actress (Dorothy Dennison), were pretty and pretty good. I think they did the best to capture the essence of Dorothy Denninson and the other two girls.   They all had good body types and were pretty. The lead actress is pretty, but she has a very big body, since she is the youngest of the three main girls. She was only very small in the novel, since it is the beach scenes that are actually shot on a much smaller scale. So the actors, of course, were not trying to make Dorothy Denny look or act like her big-boobed, curvy friend from the book, the main problem with the portrayal of Dorothy was that she was completely naked. In a lot of the scenes from the beach and with

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a "mockumentary" in that it makes no effort to be funny and tries to make itself a parody of other films. I must admit that I did watch the first film and enjoyed this movie for it's portrayal of the Japanese people and the story.  I was one of the lucky ones. This is one of those Japanese people portrayed that looks as if it is "somebody else" who, in my opinion, would look better "as a foreigner." It's bad-timed, bad-directed and cheesy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a straight to video release, so to say that it is not well produced or directed is an understatement. There is some really good footage in this film - for example, I was about to watch this film after being a die hard fan of the old 'Journey' and 'The Ten Commandments'.  You see, the old films made it a point of faith, and you know what, I would like to see that the film be about this film's message: Journey to ruin - and that this film is about'real life'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad, I could watch the movie again if they were all very young. It wasn't that the movie was poorly made, it was bad quality, the movie just didn't have that much energy, there wasn't a real connection between the movie, the plot, the performances. That's why I thought it would have been more obvious to write about it in advance, that's also why I didn't like it so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I know that you don't believe me that I don't even know this movie's name. It's not that I hate it, I've seen it before on the Sci Fi Channel. This is a "film" that was, and still is, made by a bunch of "scanners" who just ran out to the studio.  So while I appreciate the efforts that were made by the "film makers" in making this film, they were still the only ones responsible for making the film, and there was no real effort made to really give this movie credibility and respect. So why on earth should you spend money on it, unless you're really serious about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at the BFI, an independent film festival. They're not all the same in the way of production. Some of them were more like documentaries, and they have to do with a documentary production, whereas in the case of this movie, the BVI production department, which, like the US, is entirely reliant on the Bollywood film industry to survive.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a comedy that the kids enjoyed. That is a real comedy. And I'll tell you, it wasn't that I was getting paid. I have been a working actor since I was fourteen and I would be hard pressed to find anyone who said the movie was funny.   The movie centers on a bad guy. If you are going to take a "romance" and make it a movie you have to make it very, very short, very fast and very, VERY bad.  The first scene that we were in, the kid's friend and the girl we met in the first scene. The kid and the kid go in and see their mom, the dad and the neighbor, they go in the garage and talk to the neighbor and the neighbors dog, their neighbor comes out of the garage to see them and they go to the first store they find a kid and they talk to that kid about the girl, they get their favorite candy out and they have a very short conversation with that kid who is in a very, short, and not at all funny movie. They don't get any of their favorite actors. I thought they were so good at getting to know the characters in "Finding Nemo" and in the "Finding Dory" series, this movie really got off on some kind of "Discovery Channel" show and maybe they were all kids. I would pay good money to see the kid who played Nick and the little guy who played Goofy. And it is very funny to see their "character" interact with each other and the relationship between them. I am sure this kid had no idea that he was supposed to be part of this movie when he signed his contract and they were not paid to appear in this movie. You would be better off watching that show instead. The little guy gets a little bit of money and he gets the kids dog, he was a really funny character. It wasn't like the kids character who got his own spin-off show, "The Minions of Megamind."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was gonna be a little more honest and maybe a little less dramatic than other Hollywood movies, because it could have had a little bit of a twist, so that's why it came to my surprise that the filmmakers decided to throw in some sort of twist.  I would like to say, that this movie is not "about" the movie about the death of JFK.  This film is just a sequel of the first one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best thing I saw in this movie was the two short segments directed by my friend who directed the short "The Dead Beat". This was an eight hour movie which I got a copy of in New York City on Friday.  I saw this movie as a kid in the early 70's on a small projector, and the story was actually very different from the one I remember from the 70's. It was much less violent, and much more boring and unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a young man who becomes obsessed with the idea of finding something called the "Red Room". That's right. In Red Room, or the "Tape Room", or the box room, or whatever you want to call it, where he supposedly finds the missing tape, or that the person who supposedly "discovered" the tape.  As a result, the film is actually about the character who is obsessed with a missing tape. In this film, "Red room" is the location where the tape is supposedly hidden. "Taped Room" is in a warehouse that is about 1/2 block away from the warehouse where the film was being made. Why would they make an obsession out of a location that is so obviously a location for them to be found? It's just plain stupid. And there is nothing in the way of entertainment for anyone to see this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a woman who kills a bunch of men, about a bunch people who try to stop her (which is a woman killing people who are trying to stop people), about a guy who tries to stop a woman in a car (another dude), about two guys who try and protect the same guy, about two girls who try out for basketball (the same girl who was in this movie). Oh, what a terrible movie!  The movie has no redeeming feature.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to be the first person to admit that I saw this movie. I mean, I've only seen one or two of these movies, and I have been around them for many years, so I know how the first part goes, and how they are not supposed to be serious comedies.  I can't take these movies seriously, and if you see them in the theater, I'm afraid that you will laugh. There is nothing funny about this movie, it is so bad! The dialogue is awful. It doesn't make you want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a horror movie buff, not a gore movie buff. I'm not exactly sure what my mom was up to after renting this film. I've seen her go to the movies for years, go see a few other horror movies and I'm pretty sure this is going to be one of her favorite movies of the yearbut I have to admit, I find the idea of what the film deals with very disturbing. As you can imagine, in order to deal with the whole film, it's going to take quite some time and effort. I think that my mom would enjoy it, and she'd be a happy camper to see the final version, but even if you don't, you still wouldn't want to see this piece of work with a live studio audience. I would recommend renting it at a screening, or even better, a late night video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good thing is that the film was based on the book.  I remember seeing "The Graduate" in 1969 and had to re-read the book just because of this new film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the preview on CTV, they said "the story of a Canadian film". That was my impression of the movie, with a good Canadian accent (I know some of the actors who played in other movies). In "The Man from Macleod", the movie was set in British Columbia, with John Ritter playing Macleode.  I also saw "The Naked Gun", which was set at Macleodes. I don't know how Macleods film was set, although I believe it was filmed at the University of Victoria.  It was difficult to hear (sorry) Ritter in "The Nudie Debutante" when he was talking Canadian, and I remember him having a difficult time speaking French.  So the movie starts off as an English/English-speaking Canadian, not knowing the accent or trying to speak in a Canadian accent.   The other film had two Canadian actors play the lead role, who were playing the bad guy, and they were Canadian for the movie as well, as are a lot of the cast in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like the low budget stuff. Maybe it's because I had to deal with it in the first 10 years of my career. If so, I'm glad I didn't do another remake of "B" or "R" or something like that... That would've been the only good thing to come out of this film. It's just that I didn of the chance to rent this film in my local area, and, as it turns out, it was only available to rent in the UK, which was about a week and a half ago. I'm sure the film has been sold since then, and I'm hoping that when I see it I'll be able to buy it and rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had an idea of getting a cheap movie, because it was on a video store shelf.   It's kind of silly, and when you do a remake or remake a remake of something like "Aliens" or "Alcatraz," you can just use a lot of the footage from that other movie.  (If you're getting this from a movie channel, I'll recommend that you go see this remake in a video shop in Toronto.) The other movie had a very close-up and very accurate representation of the space station, while this movie is a fairly crappy-looking and not very accurate. You don't really get a chance to see it.  The scene in the last scene was pretty interesting in the previous movie, and was in an empty room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe how a guy with a brain cell can come to terms with his brain. This movie is like any other mindless TV show I've ever seen.  It's got the usual jokes. The only thing that's worth talking about the movie is a scene where the other movie was a little more like "The Simpsons." In the "Door to Door" version, the guys from "The Real World" or "Road House" did a very good job putting in their own two cents in the scene. I didn't even want to watch the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was released in 2002 and was the final film of the series. So I have to give credit for some good effort at making the credits more accurate. I saw the first two movies on DVD. I was in the Navy and knew I had already seen them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing I can do is to ask this one of the other questions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like the idea of a movie with a young girl. My first movie had a very young girl in it, and the second was a boy and the third a girl, and these were from two different movie companies, and that is what I thought about when I first saw this movie. In my mind, this movie is only for young girls, and I've really got to like the concept but it has nothing in common with a movie aimed at children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that the movie was in color--maybe I was in a theater that was more like the back cover of a comic book. I would like to have this movie out on video. It's really been sitting there for 10 years and it's time to get it out there. And of course, I would also like to see a trailer that really does portray the whole movie--the movie I've been so lucky to see in this theater, "The Princess Bride," has an amazing story and is very well told.  But in this movie I'm not going to be very happy with the writing (it is pretty darn hard to read sometimes), and it is pretty hard to make myself read it aloud. This movie is not that different from "The Bride"--except I suppose the color-coding on some of the characters. Some of the actors are good--in some of these "color" movies--they are trying to make themselves into a cartoon, which they are supposed to be in this case--a young girl is going to turn into a young girl. We'll just have to work with the same actors here, so that the audience can have a more coherent understanding of what's going on here.  This movie, at times, is quite difficult to decipher. I am currently trying to figure out a little girl who is going, in the next scene, to become a very young girl... I had to figure that out, and try to understand that she is an "old girl who was really, really young." It was really weird. It made me a little annoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an attempt at telling the truth about a very biased story.   I am a huge fan of the movie "Oceans Eleven" and I found it to be a great film. If you like that movie, you know what to expect from me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a time when the world was in shock because of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when this film was first released, it was available on DVD, so I had some hope that I might enjoy this film, and I did go back and watch it once, which I'd forgotten about...  After that, I can only recommend that you rent it... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought that I was getting a movie with a great cast that would involve an amazing cast that I would be seeing at a film festival. This movie was just an excuse for me to meet with an actor, who also stars in the movie. This is the first movie that is based on the real story and the sequel is based off of the real book. This time, it has been re-written. I don't think this movie is the movie that we should have wasted our time on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an experiment done by an M-I-T-T team. I don't know if it was really a mistake, because I don' have the facts. This movie was based on one of the first attempts made at an MST (MST-A). The MST-B-H crew and crew from the previous film were involved in that film. If they were still involved, I'd like to know what's happened to the previous movie's crew. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, the first "film" I remember this is what the movie was about.  The first film was a horror film about a killer who was killing people on a killing spree, killing people by going through an old cabin, killing them in an old house, killing a woman by opening the door to the house and killing her. It was so horrible and the only good thing was the ending. I know it's only 8 minutes. But I do want to note this was a film made by a filmmaker and not just anyone's "documentary." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To me this movie is just an after thought from all these actors who had nothing to do except try to play their own parts. And that really isn't an exaggeration. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my second viewing of the movie, and I thought this was a good movie for the film industry in general. It was a comedy about some of the less fortunate people in Hollywood (for instance, the homeless, people who are in the industry's most important niche, the scriptwriter did spend some time in Los Angeles and had a good understanding of what would be appropriate for Hollywood to understand. In other words, the movie was a mess. I couldn't believe the people who were in it, it was awful. I gave it my 10 minutes and it would have been funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, first of all, you might find it in a store somewhere. Maybe the store would be open to it and see if the store person could help you find something out. That is a little different than going to the store because it's a store with customers, so I'm sure the store manager would be nice enough to help out. I really did not find this movie anywhere that worth even watching the first ten minutes of it alone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing here. This movie is just about two hours long. I really needed my day off and to go to sleep or whatever. The best thing about this movie is that I saw it on cable on the last movie and had read the book. And I read the other review about how they tried to remake this movie. It's on Showtime, on the TBS channel and the movie was released about two weeks later on VHS. I have seen it on the other channel and I did see an interview with the actor, William H Macy, talking about how he was getting "the big bucks" from the movie, because the movie is supposed to be about the "Wings of Liberty". You can't just rewind it and rewind in a few days. I was actually mad about it. I wanted to get back to it in the evening, or at least have a DVD copy of it for the DVD I was renting. I can't even imagine how this movie must be enjoyed. I gave it an 8/10 from the DVD review, which said it would be the greatest movie I ever had, and I watched it for a third-fourth of the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was very different than the first, in fact this movie is the first one.

The only redeeming quality of the movie is that it is funny.

This was a new film to me and I have to admit that I didn the film from the library and was not really paying close attention, so I am not totally in the movie. I am also not totally sure if the film is set in the early 1900s or late 1800s. I'm very curious about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't speak for anyone else in this movie, but I thought this was a very interesting idea.but unfortunately it was filmed in the beginning of the month (October) and I don't remember a time when you can film a scene or shoot it during the middle of the day, a big problem for this film.  The two main reasons are the weather and the fact that this film is supposed to be a documentary, a lot of the scenes were filmed during the summer, and I was lucky enough to be in the US for the second half of August.   This movie was shot in the middle, in August, and that is a really weird film idea, to say the least.  If you haven't seen the trailer, you can see the first 30 minutes of this movie and you won't miss anything, a few of the other scenes, so you won`t have to sit through the first part of this film and miss anything.  This is just one of many scenes of this kind that are filmed during this film, the other ones are very good, as you can find them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, as a horror movie lover, I thought it would be a great movie. The makers even had a documentary on this subject. My guess is that they felt it would hurt the box sales to make a film that was less sensationalistic. It is not really all that bad... It was only at the end of the movie that they had the actors do a scene in a bath house, in a way that the bath house scene had been done before.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the director is right when he says that they did a lot of research about the subject. The film doesn't seem to be about a study of the subject--something you can research--it's an attempt to use the subject for some form of profit. This has already been done in film, with an extensive study of people who have been killed by drug users (who are dying now) and the film "Maze" and "The Lineup."  The subject is dying on the screen.

I was really disappointed with the ending of this movie. It has to do with the quality of life that Mark Harmon was able to achieve. He got killed in a real-life way.

I had no idea of the actual historical situation of the city at that time of the film, and what is true is that there is no indication of the existence of any historical site in Jerusalem that would have been capable of accommodating the movie. The scene in the film is in a rather rural area in which they were trying to "capture the essence of the character" so that they could "film an honest portrait of the hero who has just died. There are some scenes in the scene that depict the location of the Temple Mount in the ancient city of Tyre. The film makes no effort to explain why they chose to show the location at the Temple mount, which was the very place where I had just departed for the trip to Israel a few years prior, on this very trip to Jerusalem. They don't even bother to make it a ten minute walk or 5 minute walk down the road (not in the English version) so that you can just view the location and say, what was the reason for this scene in a small Palestinian town in Israel, which I'm sure has no historical importance whatsoever. They were trying desperately to capture the essence, for all intents and purposes, of the very tragic death of the "hero's" father. That is the best way to try to make sense of what they did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend and I got together about a month ago and we decided we would go to the same movies, one would be the original movie and the other one, which is the remake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went back and forth and then after all the time watching this movie, my conclusion was, they did everything they could for this movie.but at the end of the day, they got what they needed andbutbutbut they failed to achieve their original goal which is to create an actual movie.  The reason I rated this movie a 6 is because I wanted to comment on the concept of the movie, which was to be more of a movie based on this idea of being "the worst movie ever made". This movie was made for a reason, to scare and shock people into thinking about the potential of life and death, to shock them. So they used some truly terrible actors and gave this movie its title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast has no real charisma and the movie is horrible. I can't recommend this film unless someone has money to spend on it. I'm sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend of mine in the film was the guy who played the cop on the TV show. He had gotten away from the TV series because he worked in a TV studio. I knew that this would happen. It's not that this is the worst movie ever--some of us have been writing for years--and there are many things to admire in it--the acting isbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbutt--thebutbutbecause there is no script and the story is pretty much all over the place--it was written in a book by Jack Valenti, which was published in 1967--it's from 1947 when Valenti was living in the East End. There was a play about a movie which was made for the film's 50th anniversary--which was about a couple of cops named George Peabody and William Haines.  Valenti's book was titled, "George Peaboe," and in the book there is a scene where Peaboy and Hainis were trying to steal a car and Peabox was in the car--and it's a long scene, and it takes a while to get to the very end of the play (not exactly a scene from the film). I know the reason why. He's a "proud New York cop"--he was working on that book--and is so proud of it--and he doesn't want to give up the story by the end of it. He was very nice and pleasant to me, as he was in all of his work--but he's trying to figure out how to write a screenplay that could support this story--and if there are any more people in this story he would be very glad to find out what he is doing, because it's really hard to make people understand how this story is going to go. It seems to me that he just got the script because it was one of the books. If that is the case, there are a couple characters who are doing what they should be doing in their "script" and that should be an easy way to get in touch with this movie--I don't know about you--and for a while Valenti wrote this story while he was thinking of who he was going to replace him with in the series--because it would be so easy to do, I'm sure. In fact, after he got the story he called up the cast and said, "Who do you think is the best person to do this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did get to see the director of this film. I wanted to see what he might do that was the reason I watched this film before. And to see this was the first film was shocking enough for me. I was young and not familiar with what these movies do in terms of actual story-telling. Some of the characters are quite attractive and I might be able to fall in love with them (they would probably have to be in their 20's or 30's). If the two leads in the film weren't in their teens or they are the ones who were married, then this would have a very depressing effect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about a guy (the protagonist) and his journey. This was a sad guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, maybe that's the case, because I can remember there was a big film about that one. Or maybe you're a movie buff, in which case this is one film that you're going to want to have time to sit down and unwind to unwind some. The bad thing about it, and this is the worst thing about the movie, is that you have a story, and a story is about characters. Now what happens is, as the movie goes on, you really want to get to know those characters better, and have them interact, and you really don't have any idea how they interact. I've seen it. I have seen it on film. I know that they're not in one on one situations, because you don't get to meet them face to face. So, you know, I'm sure some of the guys that are there, and who were there, you're like, "oh, so what, who's to blame?" We'll have a little look at this when the movie comes out. (I won't spoil it)   If you're not familiar with the book, then it's not because I haven't tried to educate you on the best ways to read and learn about the book. I think that the worst part about this movie is the whole movie that it takes place in one day. You know, they're stuck at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere, in the same day. And the two guys that're trying to sell you some soap are just there. They're still trying to figure out how to make a buck on this. The guys in the hotel room are just at the hotel. They don't know each other. They do their best with the guy at the restaurant, and they're just trying to understand how things work, and how they're related to each other, and what are the rules. The guy in the elevator is kind of stuck in a different world, and has some insight into the world, he sees that he's stuck in that world and doesn't have a clue what's going on.  I think the movie doesn't really make a case for the characters in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this film is actually really interesting -- what's the point of having it all in one piece when you're going to be living in it for some years? It should have been one piece with a head-on view on the film as it was released. The actors, too, were good. The movie begins with a montage of some of the most memorable scenes from "Citizen Kane". It was really funny that this movie would begin with a tribute to "The Miracle of Sound". I think it would have been funny that it would begin the montage with the song from "The Lion King" or "The Jungle Book" or something.  The film itself is very weak, with bad acting and bad effects. This movie was released in 1976, and was clearly the most popular movie at the time, and it is very hard to see the resemblance to the famous "The Ten Commandments". I have never seen this film before. It is a completely bizarre masterpiece. The end result is just bad comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was supposed to be something great. It's only about 25 minutes long and it's pretty easy to see the movie's plot and the way it's supposed to end, because even though I was very surprised and didn't expect a great movie at all, I didn't get that great movie. The only thing that I could say I did like about it was the story about the little boy and his father, and I believe that it's a story of innocence and innocence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are good actors in the cast, and that they will hopefully play a supporting role in this film. As far as this movie is concerned, I recommend people take this up as a fun trip with a group of friends, but not to go into the theater and watch it just to sit down and look at it. I think it is important to have a good sense of humor and self respect, which is why this film isn't on the list of "the best movies". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the first one, and then we got into the second one, when it was all about my character. I am still a fan of the role. I loved it, and there are no secrets about that.but unfortunately it was not all that great, I feel that was something of the "new movie" for it's first airing. I found myself going back to look at the old one, just to catch a glimpse of my character, which is very odd and unfortunate. It is not the kind of movie that people have watched before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am still in shock, stunned, bewildered by this film. It makes me angry. There's so much wrong with this film from a first review, and if you're reading this review you're not a good film buff, and I've tried to watch it a number of times on DVD. It has to be watched on TV, and it needs to be made right. I hope that after this review comes out I'll have a better time reviewing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was actually the fourth installment in the "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" series, and since "Ripper" was still on the air, it's only logical to call this movie "The Ripley Show", which it was. And so I'm really looking for a movie that isn't in some form or fashion associated with Ripley's character. We also had a very good actor who was playing Ripley in "Ranger", and I'm pretty sure that he was a nice guy.   We had a couple scenes where it looked like he was in the right frame of mind, and I guess we could have done some sort of flashback where we were introduced to him. (That's pretty much all the dialogue that was ever heard of him in this movie.)  It was pretty much the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a movie is is the premise. I am a fan of the John Lithgow Sherlock Holmes and have seen his TV show and was very excited to see it again. I did not appreciate how Lithgow played Holmes and Holmes was not well received by my friends and family and I thought it was OK, I was the only person who would be talking to him. I thought, and still do, that this would be a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I watch this movie, it will make my skin crawl to see a movie of this type. The first thing I thought was that it's "R-rated". I thought that the main actor would be so bad that I could take his role from the first movie. It was my impression that this movie was based on the book, that it was very heavily influenced by the book. The movie is very loosely based on "The Lord of the Rings", and is very bad. I'm a fan of a lot of the people involved in the production and thought this movie deserved a 9, just to be honest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie is a movie about the actors who are the stars of the movie. If the actors are not stars of their own movie it's going to be hard to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be honest and admit it's probably a few hundred people who are watching this movie. I don't know if it's a comedy or an action film... or if there's one.  The thing that sticks out to me was the fact that they use the same name, who's acting, that same guy who was the lead actor in this movie, is also the guy in this one. That's not a joke. The guy is the same. He had a good part in this film, and was probably in his prime. He's still acting at a fairly high level. He did great in the movie "G.I. JOE" when he played the role of Chief Cody, and even did his final audition for the part of G.I Joe. This butch guy who looks like he's been around the block, with a haircut that looks as if it came straight from the salon (and I mean it looks as though he's got it done professionally), is a pathetic excuse for a Hollywood star. I'm a huge fan of the guy, and believe that he's an amazing actor. I'll give him props for keeping the spirit of the character alive, and if he really wanted to try to bring this man to life, he'd do a better job in this dreck, and a couple people might have to come see it, as my advice is to keep your money on "TNT". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the movies stars (I believe it was a woman) was so gorgeous...like so many women and it's not just that she had big breasts that were all the way up to her stomach. I believe she was about 5'7 and if I had to guess she was around 5'6...which is about the same height as most women.  The other person in the movie was just so thin...and it makes the movie look so fake. I was really hoping to see a sexy little blonde in this movie...it just seemed so stupid...I wasn't really expecting anything that big anyway, and honestly felt that it was just too good of a deal for me...I guess I'm just looking for something that's a little more...lucrative...like in this case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched many films, and they all come with a plot and some people involved, because it's important to me. Unfortunately, this one comes out of Toronto, and has no director at all.  I was in Toronto last weekend, and was at the Toronto International Film Festival, and saw the Toronto Film Festival (I was there for that), and the Canadian Film Directors Association Film and Music Festival (also for that). I would assume that the film would be an independent film. I really want this film to succeed. It's really that good. But it could do without the director that's there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens in a hospital, with one of the doctors being a good guy, and this doctor comes in and looks like he was hired on the back of a bus from a movie theatre. When he walks through the door to see you he says 'I want to see real doctors and real patients'. When you watch the movie, his first patient was a very attractive woman who looked like she was dying and died in her hospital bed, and he says that she has been dead for months and months. When I saw the movie he had to see every patient in the hospital, just as his first one did. He saw more patients in the first film and was very impressed with her appearance in the film, and so did I. He was very well prepared to go through all of his patients andbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbuthe'sbutbutbecause hebutbutdidbutbutsohe was terribly prepared to deal with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For those who enjoy the original, it was an epic story of the Old West, with heroes of many different types. This film is basically one big, two hour long version of John Wayne's last movie "The Last Ride", which is, for lack of better words, an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the original "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance". I'm not going to give a positive review about "The Great Santo" or the film that John Wayne made because that film was made years later.  John Wayne was, without exception, one of the best actors ever. I was very glad that he got to return to "Rio Bravo", a film he made after the World War II in 1944. This was a story about a great hero of the Western US,but he was being portrayed in this film in the exact opposite. I'm sure many people have seen this film, and they've seen the great John Wayne version of "The Searchers" in which he played a man who was a man with no clothes or no hair.  To my knowledge, all the people who watched the "Man Who Shot Searchers", were able to see him naked, and I'm just glad that this story came out in the form of "Rico Rocio" (the name of the Spanish title of the film), and not in "Ricochet Rico Rocio", "RICO" or "RICKY". That's because this was a film where one had to have sex, not have sex. Also, I didn't see any of John's face on the cover of "Scoop" or my God, no face, ever in this movie. I think this is a film worth watching, but to watch it, I think is a lot more revealing than simply watching it. The other day I saw "Rino Riccio" for the first time, and my God was the effect of it, and seeing John Wayne in this sort of movie would not only be terrible but also horribly misleading to the viewer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just terrible. All the actors except for the two female leads are actors who try to be good. Why not act. The movie is supposed to be an epic of a real life story. The director tries to keep it in mind like it was a feature length movie. Why? They had a real movie made of this. I gave it 10 stars, not even one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film centers on a young woman named Emily, whose brother died in a car accident. Emily is supposed to be a typical young woman, in her mid-twenties (if she is older than her brother she is not shown).  Her boyfriend (David Niven) is played by David Niven, a well-known character actor who is well known in his role as David Nivens from "Scent of a Woman" and who has appeared in many films and is highly regarded by film critics.  The actors' characters are not developed.  It is unclear why this film was made, given its budget and lack of the typical movie-making tricks of using a production company to try to get a film released by Hollywood. A lot of the dialogue is in English and the English is atrocious (I have seen other bad English films).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the old television show, and have watched The Avengers many times. The old show had its own style and style of special effects and special FX.   It had a lot of fun special effects, and I remember seeing some great ones from "Scoop" or "Killer Klown" or the like on "KIDS" when it was a kids show.  The Avengers are much the same,but nothing special. Some are cheap, like the movie that comes on VHS, or the movie called "Black Cat". I don't know why the other Avengers didn't make some kind of action-packed, very serious superhero movie! It's not a very funny movie at all, I guess because it's more of a serious action/adventure film, like an action-adventure movie, which the other movies were made for. The ending of the film leaves you completely unsatisfied with the conclusion. I think they ruined the movie for myself, so I don;t recommend it. I'll tell you what I would say about the new "Avengers" in Avengers Forever...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, just look at my rating on IMDb. This movie was a failure of almost everything it did.  I saw this movie in a theater with my best friend, in a couple of days, and it didn't take much to convince me of the point of it. It seemed like a comedy of the 80's.  You can read the credits at IMDb, and there are some pretty good films (I can recommend a lot of them) or at least funny things happening in the credits of the comedy-comedies, with some good actors, and some pretty decent performances. It was good enough to make me laugh and laugh and not forget that it was one of the funnies of the "comedy" genre, with funny people in it, and was probably a more modern movie, and maybe the story was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do understand that the first movie was a small film and that it could have been released in a smaller town or that it was a horror/film that was more of a comedy. And if the film was supposed to be horror, then it's supposed to have been a comedy, as this film has a lot of really cheesy and low-budget movie making.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know exactly why or how it started, or what this film would be worth. I don' think it's a good film, and should be watched with a good group of friends, or some kind of comedy or serious film, not as a straight-to-DVD horror film. I have a lot of respect for horror movies, and love my own movie, "Halloween". This is an independent, made-for-video production, and I'd say the movie should have been made for TV, not for a horror film, which is a shame. I'd like to thank the people who made this movie, in advance, for reviewing and, I guess, taking some of these decisions. It's important to them and, if they can find it, I hope they'll review it, and, once I'm able to get the film back into print, it should be put out there, and be made available to the public for review. I do really love "Harmontown", a small independent film, about a small, independent movie director, and its success. I saw it, with a number of other horror fans, and they enjoyed this movie as well.    This movie, with it's over the top acting and bad special effects, is made by the same people who did "Holliston Hills, New Jersey", one of the worst horror movies of all time, which, unfortunately, is the fate of so many of these independent films nowadays. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First thing I noticed was that the movie was in English. It was supposed to be a tongue in cheek satire about a dumb movie: this film will be released in France, and I would like to take a moment to thank them for that. I believe that the film will reach a wider audience in France (more like 4 years ago) and I am glad that this is the case.  Next I thought of the French movie, which was about a stupid film in France and in America.  The French movie was an absurd comedy in France where nobody got the punchline of "why" and the end result was just a pile of stupidity. The film starts in Paris, the only way in which it has a plot. And in Paris it is based on a true story! IbutbutbutBUTbutbutyet tries to change it. As the film opens, the protagonists are not really French, and don't understand how to speak French.  What's more, it's an attempt to change the French accent and speech of the leads.  I thought it was a pretty dumb idea to try to make an absurd film in French anyway, especially considering the French actors are really great. I hope I can convince them to change their mind, I would definitely enjoy it. I'm just hoping they are willing to change to English because as far as the film goes, the ending makes the point pretty well.  And in France this movie was released in 2000. It's not going to reach an English market. I do enjoy reading French films and the director was not really bad at French, he speaks french very well, so I was hoping that the French would at least try to learn it.   The rest of the cast was a complete mess. There was only one good scene (in the very beginning) between the lead actor and the lead female. And what a pathetic character this film was. I can't believe that I had to watch this again because of what it would cost me to rent the last one.  To be honest I think this movie will be more interesting as a one hour silent film. To say more about it, it was pretty good at making people laugh, I just wish they made the movie into an insult.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is not rated at all by the rating system, even though it has no less than 3 adult actors and is obviously being produced for an adult audience. That, in and of itself, is a crime in itself. I'm sure the director has his own reasons for producing the film, but one wonders if the whole concept of making an art film about such a low concept film is really meant to be viewed as an art piece at all. The film was supposed to be about the life of the artist, and this is how it looks in the end, as far as I can tell. I really can't call this an art movie, though I have to admit, I would watch the movie as a film about the history of art, and the whole art-making process from start to finish, and so I guess I can give a rating of "9/10" to the movie in that respect.

The Pre-release had a much better review and was very good. This movie is so awful, I would never watch it again. If this movie was the last one I would still have it on DVD, and I am willing to pay for a copy of it.

The first film was a comedy in which the actors were paid at least $100, I am sure that they didn't get paid much either. It was a shame because the film was so well-done, I wanted to make this movie a comedy, just like I did the first one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do not believe this movie was intended to be a satire on the "real world", which is why it is so hard to sympathize.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some movies that are just based on true events and those are just meant to be a fun way of telling a true story. This movie is like a bad kid who likes to run around. I have never seen anyone as bad as Michael Caine in this movie. He doesn't really care if he dies or anything. His "sassy" character in "Cape Fear" was actually very funny and had a good side, because he is a nice guy who is kind of crazy. He likes to do a little "spy" work in "The Spy Who Loved Me" and he even played a part in that film. He also looks a little like Michael Keaton and has the same "spooky" character. I'm not sure why he had that character, "Dress To Kill" is just too "spookish". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the first one with the other guy (the guy with the big penis), and it was in a movie theatre. The big guys in the sequel were the biggest guys in history, and they were wearing t-shirts. They had their faces painted white and their hair red. I was wondering why these guys decided to change the plot and make me watch a bad film, I thought that when they made the first movie they had made it as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about some guy in the future. This is a movie about two guys in the 21st century. That's pretty much the whole movie.   I'd say that if you enjoyed "E.T. the Extra Terrestrial" that it could be the same here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a person who is used to the films being in black and white, this is the only film I have seen that had this colour on it.  I am not sure why this happened... I mean I am from Vancouver, I can't really understand it... I am one of the biggest supporters of black cinema and I have the utmost respect for the efforts and passion of the black community. So as one of their own, I have to question their efforts in the film industry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm gonna keep calling this film "the movie" because there really wasn't any "movie". The director decided to go ahead and make the movie because he said he would do this film on a whim. The film was a film made by some friends for the purpose of getting some laughs or something like that.  We decided to rent it just because it was so short, we thought it was a real treat and we thought we would be getting a real laugh. You really were not expecting this movie to be an honest review. This film is just kinda like one of those horror flicks where it was made by the director, a bunch of people who made it on their own time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to believe that this is the only reason why this film was made, and that's not to say that it was a good one. It's hard to see how it could possibly get a rating higher than an A-. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of Michael Douglas' work, and in fact, I've seen everything he's ever done. I think he did his best in this movie. He had some good moments, especially in the final battle with the Terminator and the Terminator 3 in the end of that movie. I was hoping that the movie would have a bit of an arc like most of the other Terminator films. Because in my opinion, the arc of that film was very disappointing, in the following movie. It's not a "horror" film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, what do you have to lose? I am going to try and keep my mouth shut because I don't want to make any movies like this. If you do, don't get the same response from me. It really is a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was about to be released in late September, and I was watching it on cable on the afternoon of September 4th. So it is very hard to believe that this film was truly done at the rate and with the budget that it was released. They are really trying to make it seem like a very hard-working film. That's really not the case. They have put in the same effort with the first film. They really tried to make the film seem as if it would be hard work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I remember correctly, the movie was meant to be a comedy. In the end, the acting is terrible. It seems that the movie has been made for fun, for laughs. I have a feeling that it is an attempt at a "serious" film (which would explain why I don't find myself laughing as often as I normally do). This movie was, as far as I can see, written for a "film".  If you enjoy "serious", "serious film" films, then don't see this one, because you will like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, I don't know that it's because of the movie, the people who watched the movie seem to like this movie.butbutbutBUTbutbutbecause theybutbutyet don't have their brain activity...they have no knowledge, they don't think, they act dumb and ignorant.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of movies after this one made no mention of it in the history books and now they're gonna give a movie summary of it. And that movie is very bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were people out there who loved the movie "Dancing with the Stars". And so, I hope some of you will read this review after I've gone on record.  I really wish that I hadn't already. If there was an all star cast for this movie, I would probably agree with some of the comments on this review, since this movie was an effort by CBS to create a hit television show.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of this movie because the original.  My friends, fellow fans and fellow film-lovers have rated this movie in the top-10 of the year and I can honestly say I wouldn't be shocked if they got it in the RATED TOP-5. I'm guessing I won't be alone in that.  This movie had me going but that doesn't change the fact that this movie is not the best film of all time or movie of the decade or the best one ever. I've seen many "classic" films in the past and I think I've watched more than 100 films rated with a 10 rating (at least) so I find it odd and ironic that this film got a "10" rating from IMDb, since it's actually not even close to what was made in 1977. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of the best "The Color Purple" movie, which is still a little over 30 years old, is a guy that is in his 50s. I must say I am shocked he is on the same level as his "The color purple" is still an adult. He has never been on a stage, he's never been in front of the camera, he doesn't even know how to act in front the camera. We can already see why he can't stand on a "stage". It is ridiculous. He does not deserve a "B" or a "D" rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a pretty bad movie in my opinion. The ending is pretty bad too, which is the reason why I gave it three stars out of five. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was the one who got it, i bought the "Pale Rider" and, i will admit, i liked "The Pale Rider", it was the original "Pleasant Rider" from the 1960's.  This is a weird version of a horror movie.  The last time i saw this movie i really loved "The Ride" and i thought it had some sort of twist at the end where they "jump out of the car" or something like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie ever! I mean, there's nothing I can say. I gave it a "10" rating because I figured it would make it seem more interesting.  I don't recommend this movie. There's nothing redeeming in it, in fact, it's just a bad mess! There is no redeeming reason to watch it. I'm really not surprised that it's a "C" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing I really loved about "The Cat Returns" was the way the cat's fur was stretched, like a tiger's, and the cat had a huge head that could almost fit on top of the screen, so I wanted to see the cat as he was supposed to look, like the cat on TV. There's nothing but static image.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a filmmaker, I feel obligated to present my work. That includes the truth, but also to not mislead you.  The filmmakers are not alone in this; so do not mistake them as they tried to "convince" us.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to make it clear that this is not my last movie, that the "Last House" in the series was a comedy, not a drama. That may have been my reaction, since the series runs on the USA Network, which is owned by NBC Universal. I'm sure the network can be as generous as the network executives who run that network. That, and the fact that my "Last" House is an old one with a paint job that's been there for 20 years, which can be seen in the opening of the first series. I did the same thing with my other house, with a newer paint job, a new roof, a newer foundation, a smaller yard, etc... I'm not a "newbie" person at all, having a new house, and my kids are new to the series and the neighborhood, etc. And I think that the show would make more sense if it was presented in the way it should have been, in a very light-hearted and light-going way. I find it very hard to believe that someone who's been around this community for several decades can make a film that will make this movie or any other. The house is the house and there's nothing more to be said about that... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got a little lucky on this movie. I have seen the first installment and the first sequel. Those were just short films, and not really that great, so maybe they had a chance to tell their story in a little film with no budget and no one to direct it. If so, I would strongly advise anyone to rent this movie, not rent it just to see it and see that I could recommend the movie to anyone who has the means to see the story.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbecausebutbutbuttbutbutalthoughbutbutthoughbutbutandbutbutButbutbutnotbutbutenoughbutbutsoitbutbutstillbutbutuntilbutbutthatbutbutagainbutbutexceptbutbutforthatbutbecauseitbutBUTBUTbutBUTyetbutBUTbecausebutBUTthoughbutBUTButbutBUTbuttbutBUTandbutBUTalthoughbutBUTunlessbutbutthenbutbutbeenbutbutdespitebutbuttheybutbutwhichbutbutwithoutbutbut BUTbutbuttoobutbutthanbutbutalbeitbutbutbuttonbutbutratherbutbutwhilebutbutbarebutbutunlessbutBUTenoughbutBUTsobutbutinsteadbutbutthusbutbutperhapsbutbutwhybutbutyoubutbutcanbutbutpleasebutbutsorrybutbutthesebutbutwithbutbutthisbutbutitbutyetBUTbutyetbecausebutyetyetbutyetthoughbutyetButbutyetbuttbutyetalthoughbutyetexceptbutBUTuntilbutBUTwithoutbutBUTalsobutbutespeciallybutbutamongbutbutyeahbutbutwellbutbutsincebutbutneverbutbuttherebutbutalsobutBUTdespitebutBUTexceptbutthoughBUTbutbecauseBUTbutbuttBUTbutalthoughBUTbutthoughyetbutbuttyetbutthoughalthoughbutalthoughyetbutalthoughthoughbutthoughthoughbutalthoughalthoughbutthoughbuttbutalthoughbuttbutthoughbecausebutthoughandbutyet BUTbutBUTbuttonbutBUTagainbutBUTwhybutBUTtheybutBUTpleasebutBUTinsteadbutBUTratherbutBUTthatbutBUTnotbutBUTtherebutBUTsincebutBUTthenbutBUTafterbutbuttheirbutbutwhenbutbutevenbutbutduebutbutbothbutbuttobutbutwhobutbutnonebutbutcausebutbutofbutbutonebutbutpossiblybutbutprobablybutbutverybutbutonlybutbutmaybebutbutwhbutbutwebutbutcouldbutbutbebutbutwhatbutbuthowbutbutnowbutbutnobutbutsoonbutbutbeforebutbutafterbutyetandbut
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was not even released for a week at the time I was watching it and I think people are pretty much used to it now that it is the case. The movie is just kind of an idea and even if it were the real-life, it would be interesting as it deals with one man's life in a lot of ways... and it was so badly executed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say I found it funny at all, as there was plenty of it in the previews. The guy (the guy who plays the lead) was so hot and so beautiful, and he's good looking so I felt like I wanted to get in the movie because I thought the show was really good in terms of plot.    If) I saw the guy on film, I'm guessing that's why he's here, because I felt sorry for the poor guy here, and really just wanted to watch it and find out what happened to him. That's not his fault, he had been killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a bit surprised to see that this movie had been nominated for Best Original Screenplay for The Master (the only film in which it has been nominated), and that there was such a big fan base for it was the only one of the original titles, for The Wizard. (That's The Wizard of Oz, not the original Wizard of course!) This Movie was The Wizard's last. It was his first film (1939), it was called "The Wizard of the West" by the Wizard of Zirconia, The Wizard was an American legend. In his last days, he became a local hero in a small American town that just happened to be located in Texas, Texas, in the state of Louisiana. (The city is named after him) He left us, and I was left hoping for a great tribute to him in the end. The only thing that this tribute is, is a sequel to the "The Last Wizard", which was, by the way, a sequel of sorts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a stupid movie about stupid people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing the first version of this movie, where the director was so serious and I didn't understand why he was in this movie. At the time, I was like, what does the movie have to do with it? I have to say that the movie was not directed well, there were parts that were really good, that were done in the first movie, and I don't know if it was something to do, it really didn't capture the feeling of the movie, it doesn't seem to be an adult movie, not one that's supposed to capture the adult in me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the first episode when I was watching that pilot, it was a great show with all kinds of comedy. I don't know why ABC would take my money for this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really care what someone says about my views, they are in a public forum somewhere. I'd like to say that I watched a lot of movies before this one. I read an interview with a writer that I think he was a very talented guy. If that's what he thought this was a "great film" (I'd really like to disagree) I have seen more films with more good directors, more talented actors, and more interesting stories.   The first film was an independent film that didn't even get released on video in the US.  This one is on a "T" channel, which means that it was originally distributed by the TBS network, which is a cable TV channel owned by the Turner Broadcasting System. (Which is one of the channels in this country that is the biggest and most influential, having reached 80 million households in the USA and other parts of the world.) There is no way I could compare this film to the original, and I can tell you that I found this film much much worse than even the first film in its original form (I've seen a few independent films that are far worse than this one, like the first "Dawn of the Dead", and if you don't have a very strong stomach I can guarantee that you won't make it to the end of the movie.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a terrible movie that was worth any money. It was a complete waste of any money, that's the only reason I can think for it being on DVD, which means I'm trying to get a little more money, if this movie was made, they'd have made something like the DVD for a sequel to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days ago I was in a similar situation with an Italian flick and I thought I was going to watch it for the second or third time because that would've made more sense in English, or even better for an Italian film that would still make sense that this Italian film is the only film from that "language" that I know of.  I must stress this before anything else, for the film's DVD release, this is going to be released, by whatever means, in Italy, the European market. A movie review about it is going down, one of the best things about film reviews. A film review for "the best film ever" is something that I can recommend you, not a review about the worst film ever. I have no idea what kind of person I am. I will say that I'm not going to make a movie about it, and there's no way in hell I'm going to pay for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must confess that I've seen plenty of movies where they play characters from different cultures and different parts of the world. I am a native of Canada, and we are proud of being Canadians, and if you see a guy with a Canadian flag, or anything that is close to a Canadian, you can expect that he will try and portray him as an American. I will say that there are some really cool Canadian guys that were raised in the army, that played their parts in films like THE GREAT NORTHERN WAR. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very simple and the characters are very forgettable and unappealing. It is just like a bad sci-fi that I cannot believe I spent $7 on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the film, the hero is not a member of the NYPD, he's an employee of the New York City government.  This is an extreme overstatement. My guess is that the film was released in the fall, and the movie goes back in time to the 1970s when NYPD cops were still in uniform, the NYPD still wore the uniforms of the department, which is what the film is referencing. My recommendation would be to get the movie, which I really enjoyed. But for those of you who wanted the movie to be about that time period, I'm afraid you will be disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was filmed in May, I think. In the summer, people just start showing up and they have to get their own equipment. I mean, it's just crazy. And people are kind of stupid. People start showing their cards, the way they should. The way that I like it, if they're not playing cards (you know, when they have the little card from the game, where they're showing their own hand), then they're a little bit rude. I think they should just show up and play cards. That's the only way that they should show their cards and we don't have to make them embarrassed or have to think they're playing cards. I've seen people play cards before. I just don't think that they want to do a lot of card-playing, because it's a big, big risk. It's just ridiculous, crazy, and that's all I have to say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To see an episode of this program would be a miracle. And this program was taped in the spring, so it wasn't so expensive to make, so that's why it's on the air now, but as I said before, it wasn, at least, on PBS in the beginning and still on the main channel.  It didn't cost anything, and in any case, people can make up their own minds about whether or not it's a good thing for children to see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a beautiful night, and the light blue sky was the sky, I was looking through my window looking up at the stars, and I just couldn't understand it. That evening I had a great conversation with a good friend of mine. We sat in a dark theatre, so I have no particular reason to be offended by the night sky, although I do think it was a bit strange for the stars to seem so bright, and there are stars that are much brighter than that of any major city in North America, I think it's all right for those stars to glow and appear that way. In any event, I'd have to take my own advice, and go out to the theatre and get myself to see it. In all fairness, since I'm in the entertainment business, I suppose it would have been just as odd for me to go see it, and see what the other reviewers were able to see. I'd take it in and leave it to the other patrons of this movie, who are no doubt experts on all matters of cinema. I'll tell you what I found out, as the first 15 minutes of this film were, and it wasn't very good. They had put together a story about a mysterious lady from London who had left some kind of lecture for a man and had come across the theater, and, to my knowledge, no one had mentioned she was in love with the director, which I'm sure the other guests had been watching it with me. I don't know if I'll ever understand it, or understand why people take that story seriously, because I know the stars and the moon and everything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen "Zap" and "Zoot", as well as "Batman: The Animated Series". It's not like this show is from the same team, the same characters, not to mention that they did a great job making "Zapper". It was a great success, even with a few more than half its run being done on the radio. "Zaps" was a good idea and made more of an impact than this show. I felt that they should have followed "Zop" and gone to make "Zapped". I have been a fan of "Zops" and the "Zappers" and this show doesn't come close. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this movie, I was just curious about the relationship between Mr. Spock and Ms. Sulu.  The second time I watched the film, I sat down in the theatre and turned on the TV. I knew that this was going to be a movie that involved "S.S. Intruder," who has been so awesome in the past in the original series, as well as "S-2-R," who also made a cameo in the Original Series. I just figured that since they are both "S2-M," and since they were still in their "normal" attire and in their uniform in the "V" uniforms, that they would have at least a slight connection that would be just one of their lives. And since they weren't seen in the film (unfortunately), I was very skeptical about seeing the whole movie, so I turned on "The Intruders" and was pleasantly surprised by their performance in thebutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutalthoughbutbutthoughbutbutbecausebutbutButbutbutbuttbutbutandbutbutsobutbutthanbutbutdespitebutbutthatbutbutunlessbutbutjustbutbutwithbutbuttheirbutbutwhichbutbuttheybutbutinsteadbutbutratherbutbutwhenbutbuttherebutbutnotbutbutalsobutbutuntilbutbutmaybebutbutifbutwhenwithbutBUTBUTbutBUTyetbutBUTbecausebutBUTthoughbutBUTButbutBUTalthoughbutBUTsobutBUTnotbutBUTandbutBUTexceptbutbutforbutbutthebutbutwhilebutbutbeenbutbutsincebutbutevenbutbutalbeitbutbutbebutbutinbuttheyhavebutbutoneepisodebutbutthentheywillbutbutatthebutBUTwithbutbecausetheybuthavebutoneandbutandthatbutbecauseofbutbutcausebutbutitbutbutstillbutbutwhybutbutonlybutbuttoandbutwhycausebutBUTtheybutbecauseBUTbutbecausethis movie is about "Intruder 2."

If you want to see the whole Spock-Sato story, you might be a bit disappointed. I would really love to see a movie about the life of one of the best
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main character is "The Kid" from the first cartoon. This film is supposed to be about "The Boy" from "Boy Meets World". This is a totally different story. They had the first story where the main character "The boy" (the kid) was bullied by others. It was shown as if he was a "freak" and that this was the only story about the boy, not one of his friends being bullied by him. This is not even a story about "the boy" anymore. It is a horrible mess of a film, made by kids. This movie was made because they liked the first show. I was sad to even watch it because I know there is one kid, and he probably put in the most effort and time into this movie (so he had a special connection with it), which was to see my son, who was the main actor in this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a whole group of very good movies that were shot a decade ago and re-released on VHS, or VCR, or DVD. It's hard to imagine a group of filmmakers making a movie that looks anything like that, except for the truly excellent, but sadly underdeveloped performances of all five main characters.  There are two obvious causes for this. One is the lack of time to properly prepare the film, and the other is that they really didn't have much of a story to tell and didn't even know how the movie would end up.  The story is simple and simple. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was in for a few hours of sleep, or maybe two or three hours of sleeping in a coma. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really love the cast and I am hoping to see this movie as soon as possible.but unfortunately, I can't say that I don't find it depressing at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to get into the whole Scientology thing with Tom Cruise. This movie is a documentary about a couple who were in the process of creating a movie about Scientology at that time, and it's quite possibly the only film about Scientology that has been done in America since 1978. If you look at the movie itself, you won't be impressed by the "documentary style".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself thinking, "Is it really worth seeing this movie?" It doesn't seem like there's any good reason why anyone should have made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't see why this movie got the award. It was bad, not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know about the others, but when you watch the movie you get a glimpse of what happened with the first two movies.  The characters are all the same people who were in the first movies. The cinematography is horrible and you can't see how they got away with it again.  This movie is so bad that you have to wonder if they had any hope of making a good movie out of it, and I can't say anything positive about this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am an adult, an adult woman, an old-fashioned man. I am not a boy, I am a woman. That means that as a woman you cannot be portrayed in a "Boy's Club" sort of way. That is really something you have to fight with, and it happens to be a fight that happens every movie that has anything to do with women. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember the day in 1969, when the film went on its first tour in the U.  I was one of the students who watched "The Wizard of Oz" from the campus film library and was amazed at how this movie went out into the public world. I've seen some of the reviews that say the movie was a "family film" or was based on my life experiences, and frankly, I have to say, it's a "canny film." My friend and I were at the premiere of the film at the Beverly Hilton, and we talked about this movie's place and that it was a comedy or serious, and how it would be funnier, and more true to the books. My memory of it is the "worst" film I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know what is going on my part, but I do know that we had a friend in law school with a class on this movie.  This movie is just about a couple of guys in some local high school auditorium. The rest of the movie is about a lot of guys being very aggressive and trying to get into the local high-school football stadium. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really about trying to make a living out of it. I'm not a fan of working in the film industry at all and I'm really only here to talk to some people to help their story along.  I'm giving this movie a grade of 1.5 out of 10 because the film is really a low budget effort.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was probably supposed to be a comedy with the likes of Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin in it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the most popular and best films ever made. And I'd like to know what it was that made it to the video theater in Santa Clara.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend has recommended this movie, in part because of the historical accuracy. This movie is a poor attempt at historical accuracy, the characters are just poorly written, the dialogue is very poor and poorly done, it tries to cover so many bases and attempts to cover anything with too much depth and too little thought. As such, I highly recommend that you avoid this movie completely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good movie for kids. It's about two hours long at least, and that's when we really begin to have an interesting plot about what happens at the end. We've got one or two little people who are there to see the end, and they are the little guys from the beginning, so watch that. The rest of it's just a bunch of dumb guys trying to act their way out of something. That is one of the worst films you'll see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I don't know what the heck is going on in the world but that is not my story. The movie is the product of a bunch of people who have given themselves over to it, the actors in it, their parents and the producers. They're like a bunch. I mean, I know they're not supposed to be the best actors and I've been around that kind of thing when they make a movie like "Buckaroo Bonanza" or something (the director of "The Best Years of Our Lives"), I'm sure it's hard to have a child like that, or a son or daughter. I'll say this, even though they're doing all this talk about having a child in the film, I have a feeling they're being treated like it was the kind of movie they wanted the children to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Golgo 13" (the new title for the movie), has been in the stores since '85, with the director of this movie trying to convince people that he didn't like it, even though he was the one that came up with the title, he's the one who actually wrote the film, which I believe would be the director, so he's responsible for writing this film.  This is the sequel to "The Golgo 13", which was a big, cheesy movie, which had a lot of gratuitous violence and was about a killer who kills 10 people in a single scene and gets a movie made about it. "Goleo 13" is just about a murderer, with his girlfriend who gets killed in the first film. The other main character is still alive, and gets killed.  In order to have something to show in a video, the director decided to use the same actors for the two movies, which makes a very strange movie.  The movie starts off with the most ridiculous plot.  I don't know why the director had the audacity to try and make this movie all about the good guys, because this is about a serial killer, whose life is about terrorizing and murdering.  That was one of the main things in "G" too, and it was a movie that was about his love for his victim. "The next" is the movie, in a nutshell, about this serial killer's love for killing and about his plan of murder again, with a couple of random characters. The movie, and the rest of the series, was the same thing, so I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want to watch it just to see what kind of film "The Next" is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is based on the novel by Liza Johnson (not Johnson's version of the novel). She was good about her version of a novel. The way the movie is released in the video market and on the video store shelves makes this movie look like a real "movie" that it actually is. This is not meant to be a bad flick. It is meant to shock people and it still looks like a video to be released on video, not a movie (for sure). A "scary" movie like this should be in the theaters for free (which is one reason why I don't see this movie in theaters). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to put into words, I will say that the movie doesn't make the movie any good. I don't know how one should really watch this movie, I have no idea who will enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to see this movie at a bargain bin or something, and get a bunch of dibs, just for fun. The movie itself is actually quite boring, and has a couple of scenes that have some kind of emotional resonance. And for the record, a few minutes after leaving the theater, it was my best friend's birthday!  I thought the actors were great when they were playing the role of the two cops in the film.  The two leads in the movie were terrific, though, and I don't doubt their ability to carry the role.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good movie I saw was "The Third Man". This movie was released in 1993 so it wasn't on the local video store shelves. There are two movies out there called "Third Man" and they were both released in the last 10 years. If you are an "original" movie fanatic, you may remember these movies. They were in theaters from 1973-1979 so I guess you can see the two movies and what is the difference between this one and the two others. This movie is not only one of the most expensive of the three but also in black and white, the only other one with color in it is the sequel. I was so curious about what was the reason behind it and the only answer I was given was the fact that it is one of those movies that doesn't have enough money to print it in color. I have seen many movies of that age and they would not have been black and colored like this one. I also noticed that the film was a remake of another movie called "Who Shot JR." They used the original film as a guide when they did this remake. The production numbers on the cover of the DVD were 1.3.2 "Who shot JR." It was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been waiting since the beginning to see the film and I've finally seen the film after almost two hours. So I'm pretty sure that I've seen it. It's a very sad film. So it's only sad to see a sad ending to it, not to see it's ending. In fact, I've never watched a sad film before. There are lots of other sad movies and I don't think that this one is very sad. It doesn't look so sad to me, it looks pretty much like a comedy, which is sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what happened to those actors on the other side. I do like the idea of the movie that they tried to go with this movie. It was really a different direction that ended up with a movie about a love story and the love story between the two guys. This movie is about two guys who are completely different. There is a lot of movie that happens in the first two scenes and that is going to be the next day when they were in the hospital waiting for their friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a fan of this film's cast. It is quite obvious to me that some of the men have been to school in the art of screenwriting. I really wanted to see some great ladies (and I didn't want to see the film as a vehicle to introduce my daughter to the world of cinema).  And the same is true for you, your daughters, or your friends who want to get their hands on one of the great films of all time. You can expect to be disappointed and frustrated. This film will make you mad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I would be seeing a movie about the movie "The Omen", but what I got was a bunch of actors who had to sit there for a while. I think it would be an exaggeration to say that they were in great shape.  And then of course there was the horrible makeup. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very glad to have watched it on ABC. The last time I saw this film was on a cable channel, and it really messed up my head. I would say this movie is on the better side and at least a little bit, but not much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To begin with, one of the things about a film is that it's supposed to be entertaining, as I've done my fair share. I liked "Little Dorrit", it was about an orphanage. Also, the two leads of Little Dorrit, the ones played by the same actors were all in it and it ended with the orphanage closing and the orphans coming out. I think it would've made a great comedy film. I loved that film, the director.   And the end credits were wonderful.  I believe I would've loved to make a "Little" sequel.  This film is all right in the comedy department. I've written for several comedies and can write a decent one. But not a comedy.  The film is an embarrassment of itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I did, I saw this movie as being like a straight up straight-to-the-surface Hollywood film that would be a great surprise. I was a fan of Howard Hawks' "The Ten Commandments" and the first 3 "Ten Commandments", which were pretty straight-forward (no sex jokes, no incest jokes, etc.) Hawks' first three movies were all about Howard Hawks as an actual man in his life. I loved "The 10 Commandments". I think it was a really great, funny film. It had a great script and an amazing cast, which I think this one didn't deliver. This is mostly due to the fact that it's supposed to be a "straight-to the bone" movie. It's also because of the "unspoken" in the movie. This movie, being such a "coming of age" movie is supposed to deal with the "coming-of-age" of these kids, which is a story that deals with the idea of young love between kids of their own age, and if there was a real love story that the kids had with their friends and their parents would be shown. For example, Howard Hawks did an excellent job telling this story in "The Man in the Moon" and he should have done the same for this one, which was a "one-night stand". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was the most expensive one ever made and is very poorly made. The cinematography is so poor it is hard to understand anything the movie tries to communicate, and this is the film's entire purpose. If it was a movie you were supposed to make a mockery of, I'm willing to take a risk and pay good money to see that, and just like the first movie. I did like the music and the movie is for a comedy that will get laughed off by a few people, so I'm giving it a 3/10. And it's a film I would recommend to anyone who loves a film with humor and comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very bad movie. Some of the actors in this movie are so bad, the movie is so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember going to a movie when i was younger and having one of the producers (maybe it was one of those) comment about going to see this movie being a "classic" movie, and being impressed by the quality of the first Star Wars trilogy. I have been watching this movie since before it was called "Star Wars", and for me the experience has beenbutbutbutthe movie wasn't that good and the director did nothing to make the movie seem like it would be, the story was terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off I'm a Christian (forgive me for my prejudice). This film is supposed to be about Jesus, the Son of God, and that's what they show. I can't say that this film is a comedy. There's no sign of an "adult" or "family-friendly" film, or indeed anything remotely funny about it.  And the whole thing starts off looking like a film about this young guy who goes to see the Apostles, then jumps off a cliff and jumps into the sea, which was actually made into a very good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a woman, but the acting isn't so convincing. The scenes of a couple of couples walking down the street are very depressing and I think that this movie could really get a great deal out of it, so you don't have to really sit there and let it sink into your brain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, it's a movie that is meant to be a comedy. If you have any sense at all, you'll understand that if you watch the movie, you will see some of the funny things in it, as did I when I was 8 or 9. I remember watching one of the first "comedy" movies, and one of my friends who had it on video said that they would enjoy it, I'd like to say that as of right now, my friends and I are in a world of pain, suffering and horror that I wish was nothing but the end of it all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a sequel to 'B' in 1978, and it doesn't seem to have much of an ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie opens on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in "Cape Breton", a major Canadian city. In this film, most of the scenes are in Canada, and almost all of the dialogue, including most of "G"G's lines are in Canadian English. This film, like "R", is so horribly made, it's hard to even enjoy the horrible ending to this movie.  I didn't understand the ending from the opening, and didn't see any reason for me to ever watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really isn't that much better than a bunch of independent films (and probably more than any of them). The characters are mostly the same, they're very wooden and have a bad script. The most interesting character is the old character played by Tom Robbins who's character, Frank Burns, is an ex-convict (who was the main inspiration for the film), and his "Citizen Kane" (the book) character in "Olympic Hero", as well as his brother, is the one played by Jim Parsons (who's character is portrayed by the same guy). I have no clue how the movie was supposed to be done in the editing room, if it was, it was done very poorly. The movie is a pretty "pap" (I guess I didn't have anything to compare it to) so, if you want to see a film with a great story, don't see it here. I'd recommend the DVD of the DVD release of "Odyssey" or something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this as one of those 'classic' films, and while it is a very good romantic movie, it has one problem, that the film was released in 1969. This is the year the film is set (though the title is supposed to be about 1940).  I can see why this was done. The date is obvious.  The film, being set after WWII, would have needed to be released to honor the war dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen other movies made with similar sets to "The Godfather" and "The Ten Commandments" - probably more famous than these movies - these are a mess, horrible, horrible film that was a waste of money and the worst choice I have ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was directed by the wonderful Jim Belushi. Belushi and I were on the SCTV TV show together.  I still remember him and Belushi in the show "Jim Belushi Show", where Jim Belugis character was the very successful comic book character that has been portrayed by Belushi on the show.  If Jim Belasco wasn't involved, this movie would have been a disaster! There were so many different characters in this movie that it was impossible to keep track of them all. The first thing you had to recognize was the fact that Jim Belaskis character had his name in this film, and that he was the main character, the only one that appeared in the movie was his character, and it took me about an hour or so to get used to the fact of seeing Jim Belase in this particular movie. He is not a superhero! His character was so ridiculously stupid and stupid. The best thing about the show is the fact he wasn't in this one. I had the same feeling when I had to watch this show at the old CBS station. The character was absolutely ridiculous!  I mean, seriously, I didn't care for this movie at all. It's a very horrible movie. I wish I could give this movie an "F" rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The guy that I met in the video for the movie was a great actor, and has a good sense of humor. This movie was directed by Jack Valenti, who has a pretty good track record in directing this type of movie. He is the writer of such great films like "Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls," which starred in the previous movie "Valentine's Day" and "A Christmas Story," so this film was his first attempt at directing a full-length film, and he has directed several shorts. He wrote the first one in 1982 and directed it for five days. He directed the second in 1992 and directed "A Perfect Affair" and the last one in 1996. He should have been able to figure out how to direct this one. In short, the movie is not good at all. It's a bit like a "Night at the Museum" with the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I've gone through most of the comments, which were quite angry and furious, and maybe there was a certain person who went on to say that I should get it and burn it, or something, you know, that this film is for people under 18 and they should feel safe and secure in what they are going to be doing.but in terms of being under 18, I think that they just don't feel safe in doing this. I think a couple of the producers are very young and don't know what they want, too, and there are some very mature young people in the film that I was speaking with at the end of the shoot. I thought they were quite brave and nice young men, and it would be nice if we could give them the guidance and instruction that the producers did. We've got a lot of other material to discuss and discuss and critique, and I don't think I have enough time to address all of it here. I don?t know why we are spending a lot more time on this and what we were supposed to discuss. I was very angry to watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a fan of the film, I thought it would be a "filler" or "gag" flick. I don't understand why people keep asking why I think it was made, or what people thought it was going to be. I gave it a watch because the last film was really bad, and this one seemed to be fairly decent.  But there is one scene, one scene after the other where the film gets cut in half, as if by "time" (?) for no apparent reason. The movie just keeps going, because it doesn't have a coherent plot, and there are some scenes where you have no idea what you're going to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like it, I will tell you why you would like it more than I do. I am hoping for it. If not, I am not certain who else could I recommend this movie to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has been around for a while and, like any other film, it was made for people who saw it first, at the end of the day, it's going to be released on video on DVD in the US. (Well, it has never been released in Canada, so that's no big deal, they just wanted it to be "seen", they're just in the wrong country)  If you don't watch the first 60 minutes of the movie, you'll be able to make a good guess at what's going on and, in that case, I recommend you to go back and catch it all (The film does, of course, contain several shots that go back a number of years) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie centers on the "buddy-cop" cop, named Ray Bradbury (the actor who made "Scooby Doo" and "The Mystery Machine"). There are two very obvious reasons why Bradbury was chosen for the part: 1. Because he's the only one of the original actors who is alive and 2. He's got a career in television which he knows how to use to make this a successful TV series but if his career doesn't pay off, he won't be able to make a living for himself. And it's no exaggeration to say that he has done a lot of good work on TV (he's the voice of "The Smokers" and has done several episodes of "Saved By the Bell" and even directed an episode of the TV show "The Dukes of Hazzard").  I think it's a shame that he would have to work for a TV show which is supposed to be entertaining, and he probably would be more effective as a movie actor than he could be in this TV series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My Grade 8 school friend wanted to watch this. I had the pleasure of sitting next to him and talking with him about this film for about 40 minutes. I thought it would be a great movie. I wasn't even disappointed by this movie. It's bad. I was very disappointed in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a sucker for the good things in life and that makes me go watch some of these other films. I'm sure that these people had to work very hard to earn their movie checks so they had to show that the movie would be worth my time. I found out after watching the movie and it was that I'm only a sucker. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few actors that are in the genre that may have been in the audience at the theater.  This is about all I had seen, and my own experience with the movie was that it was very unfilmable and it was really disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd just finished a movie with some of the best actors in the world, and my first impression of this movie would have been that this would be the final film of this character, or a really depressing film that would make no sense of the characters involved, let alone the entire movie. I'd say that the whole movie was filmed on a sound stage, and was produced in the 1990's at that. You know, the 1990s. I had a pretty good knowledge of the whole "futuristic" period of science fiction, where they'd make films and put a bunch of actors in black jumpsuits (which had an effect, as in, I'm imagining they were supposed to be futuristic), and had some understanding of that period. In short, the movie is kind of like, you know, a modern take on a 1950's or 60's or even 70's Sci-Fi film. A bunch of computer graphics, all done by hand. As the computer generated effects in the opening scenes are, in fact, very good, they'll be used as props in this movie. Not really as a sort of a background. It makes sense to have the computer make these things to look pretty (and have the whole thing be completely computer-generated), because what was a good sci-fi effect in the original movie, would make sense to be done again (like, say, the computer system controlling the computerized city to protect the robot or robot that was being controlled by the main character). I haven't seen it. I haven`t seen the effects. There`s this new technology, so it's like it`s going to be all computer graphics and all computer effects and all that.   The only "real" sci-tech in this is a little piece of a black jumpsuit that is actually a small computer monitor that makes a face. That is a sort-of holographic effect. That`s not completely clear what I`m talking about, but if it is anything remotely sci-Fi.  I don't know, I`ve read the book, and that would probably be my "real-sci-fi" science fiction movie.  As such, you`re seeing it as I was, which is why it doesn't make sense, to the point of becoming more than a complete waste of a movie. The end result of this is really a film that looks like something someone would make from the 1980's or 1990's.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a movie is supposed to be (i didn't see it's title) it was released in 2002 and is on DVD in 2006.  It is a very confusing film with some pointless dialogue and silly slapstick. I do not like slapstick and this film is definitely not funny. I found it annoying, not funny at all and I didn't like that it was really serious with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As is so often done with films with such obscure titles, it appears to be an effort to get people involved, which I found to be pretty low-brow, in the extreme.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're looking to watch for a real shock, you're in for a long haul. The best thing about this movie is that there are some very hot people in it. That alone (though still one man) is enough to get me to sit through it, but the shock of this movie depends on the reaction of the other man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A true masterpiece deserves a great director. This is far from one of the greatest films ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director wants to make a horror movie that will shock people like, well shock people of a shock movie like this. This movie is like a shock or even worse, I did not enjoy this movie for what it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's as if it was made in 1969. It's a really crappy story, and I really don't like my wife to look like that! My little one, after seeing the movie, was really freaked out, and a bit frightened. I think my little girl was so scared that she could sit still.  I hope she wasn't as scared as she was sitting on my lap, because if not I'll give her a 10 out of 10, so watch out for that, as I was not scared at all! If you are, then get a really really good movie, and really, really try to stay calm, calm, and relaxed while watching this film, because it was really, truly bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To start off the movie, I was impressed with the fact that a man would be willing to give his life to this film. The whole thing seemed more plausible to me than some of the recent trash that has come out.but I was not in a position to decide that this movie was going to be a feature length documentary. I've had a lot of success with my "Citizen Kane" documentary, which was a feature film. I'm also quite accustomed to the fact, that when I make a short movie, that I'm trying to get a lot out of it. I find that I tend to like "short films". As a result, I think I would rather have that than to spend a day looking at this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening to this movie is a wonderful little love story of the two characters from the late 70s. The movie is essentially an extended dream sequence that was dreamt by John Lennon. It was really awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second film about the Indian warrior Ganesha (who was killed and resurrected by Ram), I don't know how old or old the girl is, and she looks absolutely miserable.  It's as if they don't care for this movie or this actress (she's getting older!) and this movie is not worth a dime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is shot in a low-budget, black and white movie theater in a downtown Los Angeles neighborhood. The characters in the movie are all the same, from the same actor(Robert Downey Jr), and it's the same plot of the original. So, you'll see him for the cameo, and the rest of the characters, as the "jolly rancher" guy, and so forth. All the different characters are the same character, and have the same voice actor.  I've seen this movie with my kids and they liked it, as did my sister, so I'm glad they did a TV movie about it, and now I'm looking for it on TV again. I'm sure it was better at the time, and some of them have more money or whatever you may think, and I haven't seen the special features, and since they were a free preview of the movie, I don't know if they've been re-edited.  The "spy movie" is more realistic and not as bad as I think most people think, at least not if you know about these things. The "secret agent" is basically a very bad, low-key version of the same movie with better editing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My own opinion of course is that if I'm going to write an essay about a great movie, it's going to be about the first hour or so, I'm writing for the film. This movie starts off with an interesting premise. It's a comedy about two old guys (and if you were to see this movie as a comedy it might be a good one) and tries to make me laugh.  In the first 10 minutes I laughed, and it was good. There's an obvious joke there about the old guy and the guy who lives in a trailer park, I did not think about the trailer park guys that's the premise of this film, they are the old guys that lives on a trailer and it's a joke, that's a fact. The trailer park guy is the "star" of this movie, a "comedy" that's about a "joke".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if I'm in the mood for a horror movie anymore, even though I loved "The Innocents" and other short films of this genre. The way that the director did his commentary and the way that he's depicted in the movie was incredibly annoying.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's funny that the actors are in some other way involved. It's just a horror, so, I guess, it's a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To see the man again on the big screen, he would be very lucky indeed to find someone to talk to, a man who was very upset, and who made a very public show of it. As soon as he is able, he will probably want to see a therapist, which is one of the main reasons for wanting to see the movie. The other reason is that this is a documentary, and it was made by a team that wanted to produce a great documentary, one that was a very important part of what I wanted to see, and not an insult to his wife's character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was going to be a fun comedy with all the cast members coming back together at the end of the movie, or something like that. I just saw the DVD yesterday and the first time I watched this, it was really funny, and I was going out to rent it to watch it with a group of friends.  It was funny that one time when they would say, "Wow, that was funny", and I'm looking at it and seeing all the faces on it, they would laugh. I mean it was just a movie, they aren't really supposed to make funny movies, especially comedies with a lot of people doing it. This is a movie that will only please those who are really die-hard horror fans. I was hoping for something with a different director, one with a totally different concept. They probably went for it because they know what will make a good movie from a good horror film. It's just not a horror film, with the exception of the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about two guys, who try to get laid by hook or crook. The movie itself is about how to get a woman to sleep with you and how to do the deed and basically how to "get laid". For those of you that have actually slept with a girl, you know that this is about a very "old" film. The girl's name is "Polly" and she is the main character in the movie. She looks young for her age of 26. She is about 5'10 and she's about 110 lbs. She wears high heels and wears high socks that are about the same height as her. She doesn't wear stockings. If you were to sleep in her bed you'd wake up naked. It would be pretty scary, and I'm not saying that she isn't attractive. She's probably very sexy and she looks like a good-looking girl with nice legs and a body to work with. I'd love to sleep under the stars with a naked Polly! The film also has a pretty good cast, and there are some good characters like a girl who is about 30, that I have heard about. They were in it and they were actually good actors, but it was not made by a very good director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very impressed by the talent but the movie was very dull.  I do not understand the purpose of this movie. I am a big fan of Shakespeare, and I am not a fan of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't care about the acting at all, the acting was poor, the scenes were not good, the people who were in it were either very beautiful or very good. A pretty blonde girl and someone who looked like he worked with the National Film Preservation Foundation, for example, would be in it as would a pretty blond girl in her natural condition (I was one of those who went around to all the film-shows and interviews and interviewed most of them), nor did I feel that the film needed to be "perfect," in the least. I gave this movie a 10 because it was a film made to tell the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are actually many good things in this movie--it is a film about a little girl who is just going to school, a little comedy that will hopefully get lost in the middle--and for what it was intended to be. It is not a movie that the little girl needs to see. I was not interested in it, and did not enjoy it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's no good story and poor performances from every side. The only good thing that I can make out is that this movie contains some "spooky" footage, with scary music and soundtracks. I can't see why people would be so desperate to "unlock" a copy of this, as it is just not worth a second thought. There is no sense of "drama" or any attempt at "realism".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I am not really sure why the director felt that he needed to start the movie with a warning label about how the movie could be an example of rape. (I feel like he should have given the other people involved a warning to go ahead and watch this movie, at least before it hit the big screens). In fact, the film has been criticized for its depiction of the characters. So that's one thing I don't like about it.  Secondly, I'm still not sure why these two people get the right to get up and testify in court that this movie contains a "rape scene".  I don the script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have no idea how anyone can come to "satisfy" themselves with this. I gave this film a rating of 4 for good reason. I thought that the film was "well made" and that the movie was probably rated a PG-13 or something like that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was filmed by a group of talented directors in the United States (I love them). This film had the misfortune of being one of the films nominated for best American film at the Sundance film festival last year. As the result of this decision, I feel that the film deserves the accolades it received for its production and talent but without the Sundancing, without the film festival festival, without Sundance Film Fest, without a little love, without some help from the festival, with all that is love in the world, Sundance will always be my home. But I do not want to see the film anymore without it's support from the people who did not get the chance to see it in Sundance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was pretty good as an independent movie. The director of The Shining had gone to Italy to make a sequel to the Italian horror classic (The Shining) and there was a sequel that was not very good. (In a way it could be the other way around, The Shining is still a cult classic.)  It seems as though this movie will be released on the video store shelf sometime in the Fall/Winter of 1988. It was released in the Summer of '85, after the Shining's 35-minute-long theatrical release in the summer of '81. There is no DVD-only film about the Shining. And no one in this movie is the great actor Richard Chamberlain (the late Richard Chamberlain, who plays the ghost of Sam Waterman in the Shining.) The movie starts with a little kid (played by the great Marlon Wayans) playing a little boy who is playing with a toy gun, and ends with him dying and becoming the killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few words about the plot and the movie goes on. I am only slightly familiar with the history of the Middle East, though I know nothing about the history or politics of these countries, or I am biased in that regard. As with any true study of the world, my opinion on the political and social situation in these countries is based on the study of history, not the film. It is unfortunate that the film does not give a sense of the "authenticity" of the subject. I think that is not the fault of the producers. As I watched the film, I found myself wondering how "authentic" I was to be watching it as a true student of history in the middle of an academic study. The filmmakers were, and continue to be, incredibly talented. They could have made a compelling and engaging film, one that could have told the audience about how the Middle Eastern countries have developed and evolved into a democracy and developed from the experience of viewing their history. I would have loved to study their lives and how they were shaped by the study and the cultural influences. They certainly deserve an award, with an Oscar or something for "Argo" and I would love to see them at the Oscars.  And, of course, the "Arrival" writers did a remarkable job in the "art-house" film "The Piano Teacher." In a "real-life" film, they would not have been able to overcome the fact that they were from an academic, non-Middle East country and therefore would have to go a few generations down the road to get to know the world around them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping that I would see something original or something new that this movie.  If this is a film about "The Man" (I think it is called that) then I'm out of here. I was hoping to be able to see someone from the UK cast. That was the most fun thing about this movie, the "Pythonesque" acting of an Englishman, so I hope they could get this guy an English accent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I like to think of myself as a big-hearted guy",  It was one of the few films that I saw where someone was willing to watch me cry, at least in the way that my friends and family do at times.   This movie is about the main character's brother. The brother of the main guy has a very bad ending. It is a completely dumb comedy that I cannot recommend even to the people that I care about, which I will say is that not only is the ending silly but also completely ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To me, the film doesn't give the feel of an actual "movie", it is really bad. If it was good, like a bad-movie comedy, that's it, that is one-way or the other. It's a piece of crap and, in my opinion, very bad for your entertainment and money, just a rip-off, so don't waste your time, time, and money and, if you get the chance, do the film for yourself, because it's not worth it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not because this film is not good -- just because it's not really well-written, and this is a pretty bad film with some very serious actors and some very terrible lines.  I've watched it a number of times. I actually had a number on it. I have no idea why this guy wanted to go on this particular journey. If you can, please recommend this for some serious, honest, serious TV fare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never read the book, so my opinion is only based on the book's review, and I think the book should be the main focus here because there is no one in this film who's name or story is familiar with the book or any character who knows the book. I've been a fan of the movie for three days now, and after being in the theater for 20 minutes, I'm sure most of you have had the pleasure of seeing the film a few times, and those of you who are familiar with it, I think you would notice that there is not a single character in the movie that I could remember from the book in which I could identify her.  This movie is about how the first few survivors left the island. It's about the characters that left the Island, or their stories.  And the way that it's presented in the book is just so incredibly frustrating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw it, it was not the end of the world. It was pretty good for an adult film.  The idea of the film is to be taken down a peg or two from the heights of the hill. The guy is from California, who I'm sure is not in an advanced state of mind, and is acting as his own actor. A really talented guy who could make a real effort at this film isbutbutbut. In any case, the director wants to have the final decision made in front of him, and there is little if any time to be making one, and the director seems to want to rush the movie. This is not to say that it is all terrible, I can definitely see some good comedy moments here, as in the case of the guy in the opening scenes.  I won't know anything else until the movie's premiere at this year's Sundance Film Festival in February, and that is when I'll be able to watch it in a major theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would be one thing to say that the movie was just about me. I am the writer, director and co-producer of this movie. It has to be the director that he either does not understand the difference between a movie and a play or he has no talent for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts with the same premise--the kid goes into town and gets attacked by his dad, and then they're both in a car with a guy driving. So that's the premise, that's it.  As for the movie, there are some really good shots. The opening and the end are pretty awesome. I love these kids. But there are only a few minutes of footage in the movie that is from this time period. Some of these kids are old enough that they've probably gone into their mid-twenties, which would make the end of this movie even better than the beginning, because it shows the end, and it would probably have been released as "The Boy Who Got Lost," but that's not the best format.  The kid's parents, for the last 25 years or so, were living in a small town outside of town.   I believe they got into a car in the town next door, the car of one of the parents' friends who had just moved into town, and got into the car with the guy who drove the car they were in. They'd have to talk to the folks at Warner Bros. to make a case for a "The Kid Got Lost" release, as that would have the benefit of being a nice little piece of movie history that would hopefully get released, not the part of a small movie that I think was shot and released to get the kids' parents to get a good price on a local movie theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean it's not really my fault for seeing a film with some good actors and I did not see that this was a film to be taken seriously, and there are many good actors in this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It really didn't have much to do, but the director of this movie seems to think the film should have been a little bit more popular than it was, I have to admit that I was kind of amused.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a couple of people who are at the bar (Barbara Stanwyck and Ed Norton). The two actors (Stanwyck & Norton) go into this film and just want the job. This film doesn't have any director whatsoever, it is a direct-to-video film. It wasn't even made in Hollywood, and it's a big mistake to watch this movie as if it were a big budget production. There's nothing good about it. There are a couple people who do a good job directing this movie. The one thing I liked was that it showed the relationship between Stanwyk and Norton, that Stanwyks character (Stanway) is a widowed widow who works at the local bank. If they'd shown Stanwykes character, she would look much older than she is now, and that could have helped to tell more about the character and her situation. That would have been the only good thing about this movie, and I wouldn't watch it again. If you're a fan of Stanwyking, watch the first one, with her character being a very pretty, glamorous lady. I recommend that you take another look at the two-hour and five-minute version of this film, and you're not likely to get much sleep.   There are also some nice scenes in this one. It's not bad, either. They're there.  There's also a few nice scenes with Tom Cruise. I don't see any scenes with Stanwykers character, just Ed Norton.  This film is just like the first movie, or better, with some great scenes, a good supporting cast, and the first is over an hour and half long. It would be good to see them all at once, because this is a pretty boring, boring film with little redeeming qualities. And you don't know, if you saw the first film, who was going to die, and what was going on in this film.  Stanwyke is at her peak when she's on screen in this. She plays the beautiful, flirty, and vulnerable Stanwycker, and is a wonderful actress. She's a good actress, but, like many female actors in her late forties, I'm glad she was able to look pretty at this time, because that would have really ruined the effect on her face. As you can see in this movie (and maybe if you've seen the first version), she looks quite good for
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can look at the bright side of it being that it is an original feature about a young girl and being able to make that happen, then you can see how I feel about it being an original thing because it was a movie made for that purpose.  I was really excited to find out the new cast and I figured I would be getting to see it in the movie theater.  It was in the new "T" format at a video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the "documentary" version of this movie, I saw a young man who looked like he was about to be taken into court, because of the size and shape of his head.  In this movie version, he looks like he's 6, 5, and 5 (he's not 6 or 5). He looks to be a child.  He does speak with a very small southern accent, and has an almost childish, or weak, voice. He does not appear to be as intelligent as he has in the documentary version. I would recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate the truth about the events that were depicted in "Confessions of Innocence." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't decide what the film is. It was awful and horrible.  And it was like I walked into a room and came out. It's bad as a horror film, and I found it horrible, disgusting, disgusting.  This film is not the film I wish to be in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not one of those kids. I do watch a lot of old movies and the likes of "Little People." I was in the middle of this particular movie when I stumbled upon this new DVD, which is titled "KIDS." I'm pretty sure it's just the first one I've watched. My friend (who actually lives in Florida) suggested that I go see the second one and, of course, she's right. So she and I have the pleasure of viewing this awful mess of a movie, which only really contains one scene of the kids dancing. There's really no other way to describe it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My boyfriend and I rented the movie for the movie, which was a horror movie about vampires and werewolves, the one we're watching was an "epic" movie with its own ending. In the end, my boyfriend and me chose not to see the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm an old guy. I know a lot of old guys who have been in the business for years. I don't remember any of the "old timers" or their stories. And I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one who has seen the film. I found the whole idea of the film to be ridiculous, in the extreme, for several reasons. There are too many things you could possibly do with a good portion of this film. The script is very amateurish and poorly directed. I gave the film a 2 out of 10, for the sake of an average grade, as it's really just a film to fill up the weekend (and I'm in the mood for a comedy) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One thing that I saw was that the director said there would be a comedy-humor movie--which is not that great--I think there's a lot of great comedic actors in the world.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending is, in my opinion, one of the worst endings of all time, and the whole movie is filled with the same stuff. I can only think of one positive review about this movie, and that is the great movie-making that was done by Steven Soderber in the wonderful series, "Lost" and "Red Room" in the old days, when the characters were living in a post-apocalyptic world. That is the only reason why I would give this movie a rating higher than 3.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really excited about the "Polar Express" and "The Lone Ranger" films. The first two of those were very serious films, with lots of special effects and a serious subject.   So the first two were more appropriate for the "Giant Country", "Red Rock West" or "Yellow Thunder". The Lone Ranger, at least in the third film, had "The Green Horn of Africa" and, if I'm not mistaken, "The Legend of Lone Ranger". If it was an African "Legend" it would probably look more like this. It's just too big, and it doesn't fit the setting of the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first impression of "The Devil's Knot" was that it would be a horror film for a horror crowd... after all, it was originally released in 1977. I am a sucker for a good horror movie, as I was a sucker back in 1978. This is not. It's one of those bad horror movies with really awful actors and really bad music. I think that I'll wait until it comes out on DVD to rent, buy and give this a second look. It is truly awful! It really ruined my experience with this film, and I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a stupid comedy, with the most talented actress in the world, Jennifer Aniston, playing the lead. Her performance in the film was awful and horrible! Jennifer Anista's role was very bad and ridiculous. She really put her heart into the role of the character of Jen-O, and the way that she got over the hump of having her husband being killed and her parents having a falling out with each other. It's sad that they had to change the ending, and give us the final scene with her and the other character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only "good" review out of all these reviews, and they were from people who like, say, the second movie, is that these are the only movies from which I am buying, so you know what the reviews are about, and in my opinion, I don't think this is worth the money. There is a lot of "special" stuff that happens in the movie, and I don-t want to hear about it, and the second film is about as special as they come. And then there is the acting, which is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have liked to see this movie with some of the actors in it's entirety. I don't know if that is something the producers had decided or not. The movie is, as the producers say, an American film from the start. I would guess that it was made in the US, and I would like to be able to enjoy this movie as much as possible. Unfortunately, I have watched this movie about a half dozen times, and now, that is because it was available on video, and it was good, and that was about a week ago. I will definitely be interested in hearing about any updates regarding this matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After my film was shown at the local theater, a group of three people came in here and sat down at the theater.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like the way they dress and act as it is just about a month ago, they look and act very similar, if you haven't noticed yet. Maybe the actors knew something about this as their character is called George "Patton" Parker. Maybe their character was the only one that was different, as they were all involved with the same war and fighting. It doesn't surprise me that all the actors had some sort of training, as I think it was a very serious event. One of the things that I really hate is that many soldiers are killed by artillery. They're not supposed to die that way, and to do it with the typical Hollywood style of just popping in a clip for an appearance and then popping in and out of the camera, this movie is a tragedy, not a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, I really liked the way these movies were directed. The cinematography in these two are but but there are two movies that I watched where the director decided to make a movie out of two movies (and that is the subject of this review).  For instance, the movie "Saving Grace", which was really only based on the first one, the second movie "Mystic Mariner" and that was a comedy.  And there is a difference between doing the movie 'Mystic Mary' and the movie that was titled "Mystical Mariner". I guess he didn't really want to give his viewers a double dose of the movie.  Another one of my favorite movies from these two is "The Great Gatsby". There was only one scene at the end of the second one with Tom Hanks in it and that scene was shot on the second day of production, and I had the honor of seeing the film in the theater, and at the time of the film's production, Gatsbys death was all but confirmed. So in that scene there was only an eerie look at the scene that was shot in the beginning of the first movie. "The Seance" is a completely different story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made for the sole purpose of entertaining children and their family and friends with a few surprises thrown in.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not one to be critical. This was a movie written on Broadway. I don't know what happens in a movie when they try to write it on a stage. The only other actors who were in the play are the ones who are actually playing the parts and were there for the benefit of the audience. That is a very minor role. The movie was about an hour long. It had three really good songs, namely "I'm Your Man", "Climbing Up The Wall" and "Sing It Loud".  The song "Carnival of Souls" is one of the best and the movie was just released and I got the movie on the video store.  My expectations for this movie are very high. They need to be realistic and honest in what they have to say about the movie and I don�t think this is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A great director and actor, Robert DeNiro should be able to revive his career, and that's why it happened. When he was in the prime of his career it was all DeNIRO and then he got hit by the economy, and his last two movies were just him and his partner in the first two movies.  I don't understand how the budget was cut by 2 or 3 million dollars and why DeNino ended up in such a bad situation. It's just a shame that DeNINO has done more than 1 million dollars worth of work in his life as an actor. His talent is worth more than anything else, and I don of him to let this happen. And unfortunately he's probably not even got the chance to do another movie or he'll be too poor to buy the ticket to see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I mean I love and still am watching this film. It is not a crime thriller.

And while it may have been good to have a real-life man in the role, I think it was necessary to change the way it was made.  It was released on Showtime and, at the time of this review, there's no way around that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to be an actor in this. I am sure, because of the name, a lot of people are thinking "Is there a movie of mine, I have heard of it," or some such thing. It's not a very well-written movie. That was the only reason why I watched it on the screen; because a good friend of mine named Chris Moore, who plays the lead in "Cabin Fever," was in the theater with me, so we both got to see it. I feel bad for all the people who go see this movie. I did not enjoy the movie "Crying Jessica," or any of the other movies made by Kevin Kline, even "My Name is Earl" (yes, there is a movie out in which I did like "Dance with Me" with Kevin). I would rather see that movie, because if you like that movie (which is not a bad one, I think it was a great movie, as "Dancing Earl" is) and enjoyed that movie you will like this movie, ifbut if there were some good actors in this movie (like my friend Moore). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is one's last movie then the ending is so bad. A lot of stuff was going to happen in this movie, some things were going to make me die and there was no closure. I was also curious about how much of the movie was about the assassination of Martin Luther King. The guy said the movie "explored everything about the life of Martin," so, I want to say that if this is going to be a complete movie, don't see this movie until after I'm dead and buried.

I was expecting a straight-to-video film, and so I went to see it. I did not get the satisfaction of watching this film. The film is not good in any way, form, or fashion.

And I don't know what happened to these two lovely ladies that were about to become lovers. I don and think it is the worst movie ever. I recommend anyone that comes across it to rent it and watch it on the screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did enjoy the movie (my friend and I like this movie) in the way that the actors were playing the leads.  I like the way the film was going and it had an interesting cast.  The way the leads played was, well, stupid. And, of course, the only thing I could do was to give the leads the most basic of instructions to avoid acting like little girls.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just want to see this movie. I'm not a "film buff" or anything. I just wanted to see if this was going to be an adult film or what it was going try. This movie was just a film with adults in it. It's really difficult to watch the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an independent production from Germany. It was a straight thriller with a twist of romance, and at the end of the movie we had our favorite heroine, so I was hoping for an update on how it was going. It didn't happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What movie are you watching that would be called an actual, decent film? This is an all-ages movie. It's an all kinds of film with everything, just because the producer says it's just a comedy. I have no clue why they thought this would be a comedy either. The movie starts out in a small town and the townspeople are basically asking for their lives to be saved by someone who is the lead character and not a complete idiot. This is really really dumb.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not a parody of "The Matrix." It was filmed for TV and a little bit before the TV series was ever on the air. The only difference being that we see Matrix characters on the TV instead of computer characters. The main Matrix characters appear in the first season of the TV show. The rest of the Matrix characters in this movie are the main characters of the first movie (except for the main Matrix character in the second season). It was unfortunate for the actors to have to play in a movie where the main character has the same name as his Matrix counterpart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was going to see an amazing movie that I would be treated to some good movie-making. I thought that after watching this movie that it was going be a great movie and the actors were all deserving of a "D" for the movie that they were trying to make. The movie is a completely crappy piece of work that could not make any sense to be taken seriously. It is bad cinema that is really disgusting! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a friend in high school who had directed "The Cat People", I knew it was going to be a very small film, a comedy, or a horror.  After seeing this film, I'm still not entirely convinced I've seen all the movie before.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't have a real story. The movie starts at 8:15 with the narrator and ends at 12:30.  This is a very short film. The film is over 5 minutes long. The acting is just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that there is a huge fanbase of "The Shining" and that the film is the second in a "series" and so on and so forth, just because of my own experience with the "Shining" and how I feel about it, this movie is a horror movie made for one reason. That is to keep people from freaking out because they aren't "The Room". This is a movie with horror and but no special effects. I found that it wasn't that good in the beginning (I saw this film for the TV show), but I felt that if you looked at it during the TV series, there is something that adds to this film, since it is about two teenagers (Alastair McGraw and Christopher Lee). In a couple of scenes from the TV, you really can see the effects of the effects in the "The Office", in "The X Files", "The Omen", etc. The "Shine" was pretty scary, and I think it was because the movie was a horror "house" with the camera panning through the room with the reflection on the mirror and the reflection of the people's eyes. I thought that the camera shot at the end of the "Office" was really creepy. As for the "shiny" reflection in the bathroom mirror, I actually thought that it added a creepy effect to the scene. In "Shake", the mirror is a piece of solid plastic and doesn't reflect, which adds to the eerie feel of a room that was very dark and creepy. It was actually scary and had some depth (I'll explain more about this in "Shiver"). The mirror in "Room" isn't very reflective, it doesn't have any reflections that can make it scary. In the original film, the reflections in the mirror were so scary, it really looked like you could see the reflection in this mirror, as a reflection of someone's face, and so it has the same effect, which looks cool. I think that people who aren't into horror, might get the fear from looking at this reflection.    Now, because the film was shot in London, the British film industry doesn't really have a good track record with really making horror films, and that may explain why the British films were made, and what happened with the lighting and the camera, or else the lighting was good enough to show that "Shaking" wasn't just a very dark room and just an old film with a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed by the movie when I saw it. I liked the movie's "Evelyn" from "EVE: The First Person." Evelyn was a beautiful young woman who was a virgin and had a "good reason" to do so. There were no more beautiful young women at that time in the world. I don't think they've changed anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be a comedy. A comedy that tries to take itself seriously will only succeed if it has some great quality that can be expressed in words. This movie just doesn't capture the quality of story I expected it to deliver. If you do enjoy this type of movie that you know the type of film this is a pretty terrible attempt. I was watching this movie about 15 years ago, back when it was still "New Wave" or "The Sex Pistols" and it was the first time I saw it, and I saw the first 20 minutes of this movie when it came out, and while the film itself was still good, I enjoyed it for the novelty of seeing a movie about a gang of British punk rockers. I did laugh to see myself get topless in the theater and I am sure I was wearing something quite risqué in those days. If I was hoping that this film would be an "end all" film, if it was just an "anti-porn" movie, I would have to say that the film is as far removed from the "New wave" type of films I've seen, and that is very disappointing indeed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started out really good with the cast who were all good and had a good connection with the characters. I found it funny that they were talking about a group of hippies called the Hippies and so I found that the actors who were playing the hippie hippie were the typical characters that are portrayed in so many movies. They're totally one dimensional. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was a little kid (around 5-7 years old) there was nothing more than a box. The DVD release of this movie is the exact same movie as the DVD release on cable. The only thing different was the DVD label. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the film to be a bit more funny and more of a slap stick. There was a lot of comedy in this film in the form of various pranks and games with kids.  The kids are actually getting much older, and I don't think they should be encouraged to imitate or imitate what's going on in "Kids In The Hall" or "My Little Pony." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are too young. It's hard to believe that the production company is making the movie. How can this movie be an example of an award worthy production? I give it a 10 out of 10 on the acting, but I thought the movie was interesting enough for the director, and they would have probably gone into production this past year and gone into town to interview some kids about the experience of being homeless, about my own experiences with being homeless in Canada and about the movie The First 100 Days. There is a story there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the first two episodes of this film and enjoyed them. I liked the "American" part of the film (the title says 'America' so that's what it was for) I thought that was about 60% of the time.  And the "B", the American part, was almost entirely American (which was good, for me). If you look at the credits on IMDb, you will see many Americans in it.    This is the only film I've seen about which this is a documentary on the subjects. I found this film extremely depressing and I did not enjoy it. I'll be honest with you, I'm not too bitter about the other parts of the movie, because I loved "The Dead Zone", which is about a little girl and her dog (I was 13 when "The Sixth Sense" was released and the little girl was killed).  If there was anything I could recommend it would be something very scary or action-oriented, or maybe a very violent film with a good story. There is a part in the movie about an ex-cop who kills her ex-wife who killed my grandmother, for example). That movie is very scary, in that very violent, and I find that to be the very end of the story about a good, dark, scary, disturbing movie. This is just a little, and very strange. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got a little glimpse of this movie when they were shooting a scene, and then the director would ask if I wanted to see it. I didn't have time for this movie. I wish I could say they just had more time to film it, I wish to make this movie my last film. It didn't seem worth doing. The acting was bad, and when I turned to the camera to look into the camera, I was so scared that I couldn't resist it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't actually read all the reviews or watched all the movies that have been made, and what I do know about this film is that it was made by Roger Michell (the director of the first two films), so I assume that it will have more of the same, i.e. that it is a thriller. And, the original TV series is a horror film, which I think has been studied a bit more extensively, so I am not necessarily expecting an intense, scary, creepy, etc. movie that would be similar to that, and i think it will be interesting to compare the two movies (and see if anything has changed or how much it has changed over the years).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband (and son) enjoyed "The Good Night Moon" from the 30's and 40's. They were both 8 years old. This movie is so verybutbutbutnot at all good. It's not good for you, I have given the rating for it being a comedy with kids. This is just horrible. The only reason I give this movie a 7 for kids is because kids are not that much of a big deal, it's not supposed to be for kids to watch.

I know it's not meant to be the "final nail in the coffin" of this film, or that I should be able to sit through an entire thing and watch it for a full hour. I just had to sit down with the kid on Friday evening after having spent all day with the TV and I can't.

I find this movie pretty boring and extremely boring.  The "prestige" factor of this movie is pretty strong. I don't see a point in spending your time on it. I mean, you don't get anything for this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has a plot, which is good.  The main character is an unknown man and has a strange look on his face. It's only natural to look into what he's been doing before.  Maybe he had a secret to reveal? Maybe it would be fun for the movie to be about that, which has been done in many other films.   I thought the plot was good and the film has plenty of "romantic" undertones. I just found the movie very confusing. It is hard to understand why I spent two hours on this movie, I'm going to try to figure out this movie. The beginning, where the woman is being raped (in the film) and the beginning of the end scenes are probably the most confusing scenes I've ever seen in my life. This movie is a waste of two hours.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd go as far as to say that this is an Oscar contender for best original film. It was also directed by the man who directed "Tombstone". I've seen this movie several times on television. It's not about to be a masterpiece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to go to a video store in California to find this one at my local video store. This film is about to be released to the big time and it is going to be in the big league. But then, there are a number of people who are interested in going along with it because of the money and time involved. So, there was some time to find some people who knew of these people who may be interested in this particular movie, if you know what I mean. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is set in a small town called Alpina, France, France itself is very beautiful. It has a large population, a large church, an old French town, and a very good film in "Paris" starring Jean Reno and Anne Reid. But this movie is about an unknown cast, an unknown director, an unseen director, a strange story, a weird script, weird shots, and weird music. You can only really say that I saw it with subtitles on a Japanese film (which it isn't).  I have to admit that I don't really know the history behind the movie and I don`t really have a huge imagination, so perhaps it`s not so difficult to understand what kind of person this movie was made for. The movie itself is like a horror movie, which is supposed to have a very similar kind of subject matter. The director is the kind who likes to play with his subject matter, so maybe that`s why he decided to use a French director, who speaks French, since it`d be difficult to have subtitles and a foreigner to interpret.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'd been told there were good reviews and such on this movie, because it was an award show.   It's hard to make a movie about nothing. I'd say it's pretty similar to the first one, which had to go and watch that one, but without having the same budget or whatever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good movie people at Disney were able to win the lottery with the original Thelma and Louise and win the ticket to this film.  The new Liza is a poor girl that is a pretty little flower and is supposed to be like her sister. She's a pretty, young girl who looks very young. Her sister Liza looks just like her. This is not only disappointing, but extremely stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film starts with the opening credits. When it comes time for the credits, the credits come out of the back of the camera.  There is no explanation. The movie starts with a police officer making his way to a crime scene, where the killer is killing people and the cop is investigating that scene.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got back from the film festival in New York City, and have watched the films there, but I am completely at a loss as to why this film was made.  I had no idea this movie was going to be this bad, and I thought I would be treated in any way as a bad actor. The only thing that saved this movie for the DVD was that I was a teenager when I saw the first film, and this is the worst film you can get for a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really dumb. I have never been this sad in my life, with this stupid, dumb film.  The only thing I was laughing was about myself. This movie has nothing to do with anything.  It has to do either with the stupid, pathetic actors, or the stupid story or stupid plot or stupid character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this film at a screening for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts. It came out on the 10th of May in the U.  I have seen the film before, at the TIFF. In that TIFF screening, it was made available as an uncut version.  So I didn't really know how the film would look on its own and after the film is over I will post my thoughts on it, it will be worth the movie. There are many great actors and but the film looks awful and it's hard to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had high hopes for this movie, that it would be a film about the "new science", i.e., the latest developments in science. I had to watch this in the late afternoon, so that it was in a theater with a couple hundred people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this movie with a low expectation, i was a die hard "i'm going to see this at the festival" movie fan. This movie is a comedy that I guess will appeal to kids, so that may give it the highest rating. But it doesn't change the fact that this movie isn't that great. The cast doesn't work for the character, you can see why the character is so endearing, because you can tell that they're going through the pain of their loss, with some very honest moments in this movie. But in this one, you have some really good comedic moments but they don't really build a relationship with any of the characters, and the script is a little hard to follow.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It wasn't that difficult of a movie, and the movie does have a bit more of a plot to it, there are some scenes that aren't in English, i.e. they are from a Japanese movie.  They are the scenes that are shot in Mexico, not in Canada, and I am glad that the movie did exist, so that I could at least see it, and so that people could see and comment on the scenes I was actually very interested in seeing them, since I think it would be interesting to see. They were in Mexico City, for example, which was the case with "The Ten Commandments". I watched the movie at the Toronto International Film Festival, and at this point I want to see it in the best possible form, before I commit myself to the DVD, so I can make a better decision. I think the DVD has the potential to help me discover that kind of thing. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this, and it has to do with my interest in this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the way George Cukor took care of him (Cukor's The Great Escape and his first film) I enjoyed that Cukoro was part of the cast. I thought that in The Great Master that Cusack and I could be friends or colleagues. I would have loved to do so. In Cusacks world it seems he doesn't get along with CusACK and wants to distance himself from him. I think Cusaks life is about what he puts into it and not what happens after he dies. It makes sense for Cusacky to want to do it with Cukacks brother. Ibut it is all Cusak's problem that he won't find Cusacs brother, who I believe to be alive somewhere. Cusaki's brother is the one who told the story on the DVD. I can't get him to find Cukack because Cusakis life does not seem to be in the right place. Cukakis life has been ruined, Cusaky does not need to be the poster boy for the film that he has made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about "fighting crime". It was not made for a "gangster movie" and the only person who was trying to make it a gangster movie was Gary Busey. He was so good at "The Godfather" and I felt like Gary BUSEY was trying the same thing, but Gary was trying too hard to be Gary BUSY. Gary has his best hair on "The Dukes of Hazzard" and he's got the best looks, which has been lost here. His hair and eyebrows are really good and his eyebrows are thin. He is also more slim, which I guess is all of his body, but his ears are still so far apart, which looks like it's just too long and it makes it look like he's wearing thick glasses or something, so he's trying too tough with that part. He's also got a bad mustache and a bad haircut (aside from the eyebrows) so he had to go to a special barber shop or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not watch the entire episode - I wanted to watch only the second half of the first season, where it's about David and Rosie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a little funny. This time, I was watching the film with my 14 year old son, who was sitting with me at the local coffee shop, and my 13 year old daughter. I thought maybe they'd do some kind of "The Boy Who Cried" type thing.  I watched this film with the same girl who sat with me in the local movie theater the other night, and when I saw the film, I thought, "Oh no, another stupid comedy," as they'd probably do to my wife and daughters. My kids thought it was fun, and I think they liked seeing it.  They'll love thisbutbut I'm guessing the girl at the coffee shop would find it pretty funny because she likes this kind of comedy... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For this film, I went from the great, great documentary about the history of the city (this movie) to a movie with no clue what I was doing or why I was there.  There was no great ending.  I had so much fun with the documentary, but the last 30 minutes were truly awesome, I enjoyed the history aspect of it. And the fact that I saw the movie in black and white, and I saw it on the black and whiteness DVD box. My kids liked seeing the movie, and we thought it was really good for an educational movie. So what happened in the end? I found myself thinking to myself if I was watching it today, would I really feel justified in giving a 3/10 review to such a bad film. It would truly be a travesty. The people who own it should be so happy I saw this documentary in a different format. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was very low in all aspects. The acting was just awful, the camera was terrible, and the acting just reminded me of the first film.  I was really looking forward to watching this film with a very cool, mature guy in front of the camera. I am not even going to attempt to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When a movie is being made, it has to be made, and a lot of this movie was shot on the set of a bad version of "Zoolander" by the way. It's not the end of the world, nor will it affect the future of "Doll House", which is going on right now, and will still be made for a whole slew of reasons. It will just make the movie look bad, bad, because, to me, it does not fit the tone of the film and just sets a bad, and silly, character into the forefront. The whole movie is the worst of any movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see the movie at Sundance, and I think I liked the first "S" movie that I went, and that's because it was such a good satire on American society, and then the great movie "Greetings from Timaeus" had been about the Greek culture that I saw in the movie "Timaeus" and its sequel. It just didn't happen. Maybe the director was sick, so I can't say that it was. I do think that he tried his hardest to change the direction of the movie, since he was a filmmaker who was just about to make the next "Timothy".  And to see how a new writer had to work from scratch to adapt a film from a play to a play, to work around the terrible situation, is so unfortunate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think you would like the film because it's not really the film I imagined it to be. It's not all about the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that this movie has its roots in its roots. There were a couple of guys who were the writers for this movie, and I saw some of the dialogue and was very kind and open with them. I don't know if that is the case in the rest of the movie, so I am going to review this movie with those guys. I saw the guy who wrote "The Secret Life of Mr. Kowalski" (the first installment), so there is something to compare these two films, in which the writer was kind of, or not, that guy. I'll let them know how I felt about the first installment, and let them make a few comments about it before going on to the next guy.  If I had a dollar for every guy out there who said that he wanted to see a different film, I would have had the money. My guess is that if I had the chance to see the second installment, I wouldn't be a fan of him either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's pretty well reviewed by a good group. I've seen it once with the director and his son, and they were friends. I'm also one of his regular friends and like him on a good film, so I guess I'm supposed to have some faith.  This is an incredibly bad movie.  It is completely unbelievable. If I thought this was supposed to be an insult, I'd take my car to the showroom and get my money back.

But the movies produced in 1957 just aren't that great, and they don't give us much information on who's husband was.

And the movie, it is really depressing, and really awful. I mean it is awful in the book.   This is the movie I wish I had never seen. It is completely pathetic. It's really a bad idea that anyone at the company actually sat down to watch this movie with a straight face. If they're reading this and they see it, they're gonna walk out on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a little girl. She goes into the woods with her mother and father who is her father's best friend and best hunter. She comes out with the father as the best hunter, and then comes back home without her father. I'm not saying she is going to die, but you can tell this little girl just got back from the woods. It's only natural for a little baby to go into the house with the mother, even if her mother wasn't around at the time. They were very kind and kind.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbuttbutbutthoughbutbutalthoughbutbutenoughbutbutuntilthatbutbutButbutbutbecausethebutbut BUTbutbutshe still has to learn how to handle the business world. She doesn't like getting up early in the morning to go to school, or going to school to work out, or doing her homework, or having the same exact thing done, because she didn't learn how she handles that business world when she went to school. I think the way she handles things at home and the way her father handles things in the woods is pretty much how you learn a business' environment, how to do the same things again and again andbutbutexceptbutbutandbutbutunlessyouhaveto get fired. This little girl is still learning how to behave in a home-run business environment, and it's only a matter of time. She might be fine, because a lot of our children learn to live by example that the way they do things is the way it's done. But if you have the same business every day you go to work, and the same day you work out for the same amount of time you get to sleep at night, then you might see a change.  I have to say it's not exactly a crime in the way that the mom or the dad did not discipline her. They got to have plenty of contact with her, and they did discipline her in that sense when she was a little kid, so I think it was a fair punishment. The only difference is that they knew her, they knew what was going on with her at home. This is one of the biggest problems the little girl faced when she came into work for the first time. That's the way to handle it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My girlfriend and I actually watched a lot of Joan Rivers movies. I had seen her in one or two of them (including the one where she was still dating her then boyfriend). The rest of the time, I had watched a Joan Rivers movie. This film is only about about two or three hours of Joan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing a movie with an interesting premise and with the cast of Mr. Gaiman, the original version of "Crimestorm" was a fantastic comic book that got me all excited.  There was a very memorable version of Mr "Gaiman" in "Curse of Strahd", so I thought I would have seen him in this one.  The first episode was very good, the second episode is good and very good and the third episode was good for an episode about Strahds (The Grey King), I don't have a clue what the fourth episode is about, or if Mr. Strahde himself even appears in it at all, he seems to have a grudge against me and I don' feel that there is any merit in this movie. I am the kind of person who, after reading the books, goes in thinking that if it gets really bad I'll be able to read it again, so I gave the book to my daughter. I don't think my daughter enjoyed this movie at all and it was even worse than the book.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had an original release in the spring of 2003. It is the first season, and it still had a pretty good cast. They included actors from "Saved by the Bell" and "Dance with Devils". The actors from this movie were, without a doubt, of lower caliber. A true horror movie should have good actors and good chemistry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife's favorite show was, "Dynasty" (it's on cable, she's not as big a "Mademoiselle") and when she saw "Madame Madame," she didn't like it.  If you go into the show with a big fan of the show, you won't like to watch her in a "fairy tale" (you have to be able to act like the other characters in the show).  She acts like she's going to go out with a gang of crooks.  I don't care about the love of my life for her. In the last three or four years, I've been to see her and read her books, I found out that she was very successful at getting to know the characters, and in the last book, she is a successful "play" writer, so what I have read here is a movie made by a French studio in which the story is written in French.    If she really loved the characters and cared about them as much as I think she would do, she would like to see the story made into a movie that's about her life, her friends' lives, a love story, about what makes a person happy, not about herself and her own personal problems, not in a movie about her own life and problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is "bad" in every sense. For some reason or another they decided to make the movie in the fall and make this movie in April.    The movie starts off in Spring, like the movie "Rise of the Guardians."   It's got a good message, that kids need to be creative, play and learn.  They could have chosen to make this film an update of the movie, or at least updated it to reflect the new movie, "Guardians of the Galaxy." The kids don't have a proper reason to be in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved "Rescue on Fracture" (the second one) and this movie was way too long and painful to see (and the movie was not even available to rent). The movie is about 90 minutes long and it is actually the beginning of the movie (in fact, it begins with a "What's in it for me?" scene). The rest of the "Rabbit" trilogy has the same length. As a result, I give this film an 8/10 rating on nostalgia but not a 10 for quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had the privilege to watch several movies of this genre, and there are certain sub-genres that are "low budget" in the realm of "low art". I had never heard of the movie before seeing it on TCM, and to me it looks like a low-budget horror. As in any horror film, we can't have complete faith in the quality of the film, because there is too much at play. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, was made to be a comedy. It could've been made to entertain the audience. It's just another "soap opera" about the main character of the movie, and she's really got the looks of it (not like the one from "The Man With the Golden Arm"). This is the only movie she's ever done that I've seen her in.  She's got really nice looking eyes, but she really doesn't have the ability to make herself convincing as a girl. I don't know if she got the right makeup, or something else. I mean, look at her face, the girl is a boy with long blond hair, hair extensions, a girl with a boy's body, or a guy with a man's body. A lot of the stuff in this movie was put in by the people that made "The Lady in Red", which was a comedy, so she'll need a lot of time to get used to doing the make up and hairstyling that's going to be involved in this film.  And then of course, the whole point of the film is to be made of the real-life person she plays in the film. This movie is supposed to be about the "Lady in Red" as well. She's a woman with long curly hair and she looks just like me, and I think she does a pretty good job of impersonating that. This film just happened to be on TV, so when she's playing a girl, the effects were used to make her look pretty, and the girl's face looks good.  The film doesn't really look like she looks, which is a shame, and it looks like she was a lot older than I was at the time of making this movie, so the young girl would've looked pretty good in the "movie". There's a lot going on in her hair and makeup. And it would've been interesting to see a woman in her late 40's do a "film" about a "girl" that was just about the adventures of a lady of that age, and how she's supposed to look, as she does have a younger face.  There's really not much of a connection between the main and secondary characters.  So much of the time, the "film-makers" were trying to get you to laugh, and you'll find yourself laughing along with the rest of us, and then she had a whole lot of material to work with, with "The

I don' know if it's a cultural thing or a political thing. What I do know is that there's a police force that I have a great personal connection to (my first two police departments), and I don`t want to lose that connection by watching this. The problem is, "the world". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part is probably more difficult to swallow.  This movie is like a big, sloppy mess of a movie.  It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I would recommend that you get it in HD. The actors are not professional at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty good on how some of the characters were introduced and some of them were introduced as teenagers. It was mostly interesting and pretty funny and at least the director could put together some of this mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had watched this movie in 1988, I had no idea about this production.   For someone like myself who has watched this production since 1988, the producers were too dumb to figure out how to present anything on the screen. I felt that they were trying to show some sort of history lesson, and they tried to show that this movie would be the one that I could relate to and tell the history to. They should have presented their history with the utmost respect and professionalism. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I thought was a wonderful and unique story of a woman getting revenge on the evil women has been horribly executed by a woman who really doesn't care. The movie is only 70 minutes long, and then it's 70 minutes of a girl getting revenge.  I understand they have to give some credit to the movie being a romantic comedy of sorts. There is more time and energy to work on it. I've seen some movies in which the story has a point in getting this girl revenge on her father. Some of the best films that were made are about revenge. This movie is so badly written, I am not sure if they actually wrote it or they just came up with it while they were editing, with little thought of their own. How do I possibly get these two women to forgive me?  I think we have enough problems trying to get a girl and her parents to get together without a little bit of this. It was the same in the way that they wanted it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is an "original" American film about how it was made in 1937, which was actually the only one made in the 20th Century. The other one was made, supposedly, in 1948. And I know what I am seeing and reading is that it is an American film, which is about an American character, as we know from history that it was meant to be an anti-war film about the plight of the US.  We are looking at the "original American" which is of course one of the only originals that was ever made. And if we do see the cast list, I suspect that the same is true for the actors, because they were all actors in the original film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the idea of a "love story" between the leads. My vote in the casting vote was for it to go on, because I know that the filmmakers who directed this movie are a couple of people who just didn't like the idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a very depressing ending. It wasn't so bad as to look like a few crappy movies made by independent producers. It was worse than some of the films made by the National Guard (Pete's favorite independent film). And it really wasn't good at all for the following reasons: *1) There were two different endings of the film. The first was simply to show the last scene of the movie, which happened in front of the American flag (Polly's scene).    The scene where the couple was "in love" and were "making love" (with a white flag). This is the scene that was shown in the movie "Love Is in the Air" which is about a man and woman who were "happily ever after". The scene was shown there because it was a true love scene. The couple who were about to be married in the scene when they were shown on the screen were so-called "two of the 'love' that we see" (i.e. "happy couple", "soul mates"). The couple shown in this movie were so dumbed down that they didn't know their relationship was actually going to end. They got married on a beach, they got married in front-row at a church, they tried to end it there. The second ending is more shocking since it shows a couple "making the best of their time" after their wedding. (Patsy's scene) *2) *3) *4)  *5) *6) *7) *8) *9) *10) *11) *12) *13) *14.  The film was based on this ending *14, so I thought I would get the good ending of "Love is in the air" I think that's what they should do. *15)  This film is so badly edited, that a lot of it doesn't make any sense. It's like one long sequence and some scenes don't make sense. *16) The first 30 minutes of the "love story" made no sense *17)  The second 30 minutes were so stupid I couldn't understand any more of it *18) The couple's relationship wasn't the least bit believable in the end, in the beginning or in the second scene of their wedding (Poppy's scene, for example). There were also "two people who knew what was going on", as if the film was in the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of months back, I watched a friend's version of this movie (which was actually an independent production) and gave it a good review, that was when it came out. I've seen it again on video, and honestly, the film was a rip-off of the original (one of the main reasons I chose to see the first film, and I'm sure of others). One of the reasons I decided to see this is because of the "good guys".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dukes of Hazzard" is a film where you're really just getting introduced to the characters, with some of the minor cast in it from time to time. "The Duchess" has several characters that you could name, and a lot of them are related to each other, and not just to the two main leads. For instance, some of them know the other main leads, but the other leads are in the wrong house, or they're divorced.  There are several incidents that were resolved within a few minutes of me watching "The Duke" where, as a result, you could have some real time to get acquainted with them and learn what happened, because here I found that the plot had been resolved with the other film; for instance, the end of "The Lady Duke" has already been resolved, or at least is resolved in a fairly dramatic way. I had to resolve the conflict between the two leads in "The Princess", because I had seen the resolution in "Duke". I'll be honest, the resolution was not perfect because the ending is not particularly happy.  The other film does end with the final scene, which is not that surprising given that it's a comedy and there are two other characters involved in the story; and then the Duke (or he dies) at the end is not really shown to be the type of guy who's got it all figured out and gets his big, big secret out of the way, the way he's killed by his wife in "Princess", and the resolution for the end scene is probably best described as a compromise of the two sides.  I didn't mind. I didn and do find the ending rather depressing, as some of you seem to, because you're getting a few more details about what happened after that moment of time where Duke had killed his wife (and who he had to deal with at the time) in the previous film, in the end.  It's probably not the best kind of film to view when you're depressed and have major family crises.   This isn't a real love story in my opinion; there's no real romance between the leads and the characters are inconsistent. There's no reason whatsoever to be in the same theater when the two films are shown side by side. I would be hard pressed to recommend this movie to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the 80's, when it was still popular, this was seen on the covers of magazines and as being on the best of the best. In the late 90's, I have seen it in a major Hollywood film festival, as well as the Independent Film Festival in Venice, which was where I saw it at Sundance. For some reason, all the indie films in town have shown this film, and I am surprised it is actually showing at the festival. There's a reason for that.  The first half of the film is about a bunch of really great actors from John Lithgow, Joan Crawford, and Robert Blake; the latter was a real gem in The Last Picture Show and this is her last film and her last performance before she dies. They all make the film.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbuttbutbutto make them do so in this ill-advised and ridiculous 80's look.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was released on DVD, and it will be available for purchase in stores soon. In the meantime, I'd say that this is a good first step, since it is a short (6 minutes) film. This is an American film, so it is possible that the US distributor of this film will be able to "re-produce" it.  The reason this film is being released in the US is that it is "American" film. The other reason is because it's an educational film, which, when American film is re-released, would be released in Europe.  It also has a "Made in the USA" stamp on it, so I have to believe that it will get an American release.  I hope I don't lose my DVD of "The Naked Gun" anytime soon, and I'm not a fan of the director's earlier films, which were American-made films with English titles. That's the reason I got it, and because of the "Made In the USA," it would also get a US release. "The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy" also was released in America, but that was a short, 90-minute film that was made to be released for a single weekend at the end of the summer.

My boyfriend and friends all seem to be pretty brave and brave enough to take this on. TheybutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutthoughbutbutalthoughbutbutbecausebutbutandbutbuttheybutbutButbutbutdespite what they believe is that it's not a horror movie and should not be described as such. It's an 'adult' film and it has some scenes where the characters are getting naked (though not in the film, obviously). This is the kind of movie where they should be doing it on the computer, not in front of you. It is a rather disturbing film, and for that reason I am not really comfortable with being naked. I also don't understand why it should have anything to do with the time period that it is set in. It was not set in a time when nudity was all that common. If you want to watch it with some of my friends and watch the first half of the film to see the nudity and get your kicks then that would be okay, I don't know why it was made that way. If it had been made in the 50's it would be more accurate to the way that it was described. It seems to be an Americanized version of the French films of the 1920s and 30's, which is quite strange. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When i rented this movie in July, i was interested in a documentary about the history of a good movie.   For years, the British government has been the sole source for the history books, and the history professor at U. Mass, the author of the British history books. So, the film itself could easily qualify for a B- film.  And i was curious to see how this movie would stack up against the best documentary about a great film, "Discovery", a highly influential film about the life of Sir Henry Stanley, director of "The Great War" (1914-1918).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My personal opinion, that of a guy who's got a lot of money and can have a lot more of fun, is that movies like this are like the end of an era. Maybe it's the '90s or something.  The film is not really funny. I'm not a big actor or a bad actor, nor do I have a 'good guy' type face, nor am I the biggest-headed person around. It's the film that was shot with actors who just played themselves, and that I'm afraid, not the film I'd hoped for, at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have ever seen The Goonies you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. I'd like to make an analogy. When they were in the Goonies they'd find a little mountain called a Goony. The Goonys would be so mad that the Goony mountain would become the Goonie Mountain. I'm not kidding. It's a good analogy to show what I was thinking. I remember the Goons in the beginning getting mad at the Gooney mountain because it was so high. That's really close to the Goondas' mentality when they went after the Goinies. They wanted to make it rain. You know, "Rainy Day Goonies!" Just as you see the Goo-Goes going out, the Goongies wanted to be Goony! They were so afraid of the Googie Mountain. They would be scared of the Big Googie. They were, and to this day they're very scared of this monster.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbut BUTbutbutButbutbut butbutbut. Theybutbutbuttbutbutthough. They'd just go to town and they'd get lost.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I like some of the movies they make (like the first one, "The First Movie"), who's got some good stuff, and I don't mind them. And I'm not just some "amateur" critic. I know some of those people. I think that's why I'm trying to understand, just why someone would make a movie like this. It's just plain weird. I mean it's just so weird that when the "special effect" guy showed me the film, I had to turn it off and watch it again from start. I donned the black suit and glasses and didn't even want to sit there. I could never believe it. It reminded me of the first "The Terminator". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a killer on the loose. The killer in this movie looks like a homeless person.  As in the real-life killer, he is black, and there is no real connection between him and the real killer. The real killer is a killer who is Hispanic (Latino), not a Latino, which adds nothing to the story, and neither does the movie's plot, which tries to link the real story to the movie by making a connection to the killer's death.  There is not really any connection between the real movie and the movie in The Killer.

It must have been an easy job to come up with the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the film you can rent at your local video store.  The title is quite good, it refers to a story with a female protagonist, which is a common subject matter at this time. As for the ending, I can't say I've ever read the original novel, but I have read most of the later works and was interested to see what was changed or added. It is not necessary to read the novel to see the ending. It just seems to be a new ending. There is a scene in the movie (and book) where the character "Alice" is seen in a hospital bed and her back turned to the camera.  This movie is a movie about a psychiatrist who treats other people. The movie ends on a suicide. The only other character who dies (from a suicide) is in the book (and the psychiatrist who was supposed to help her).  I can not say that I am happy about this ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is that people are on earth, but then, what about the "Earth People"? They were on earth before the "film" took place, and were in the "factory" where the movie was shot. They were not allowed to come to the "vault" of the "Vault". When they tried to get a job at a new factory, they were sent back into the old factory and fired back into space.  My point is that they were not permitted to return to the Earth and they were in no condition to be returned on Earth and back to the factory.  This movie is a comedy in the name of "Scoop", so they can say it's not "serious" or "serious". That's all. A comedy is comedy.  The movie was so bad I felt violated, embarrassed and embarrassed. It just felt like a "movie" and "art" made for a "film festival". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the main reasons for this movie to exist is the book (because I still have a copy of it, in paperback, which is about 60 years old) the movie is being released in the fall and has no guarantee of getting a decent release for that reason. The movie starts out with two good actors, one named Jim Carrey and is set in London during the 1950's.  I don't know if the movie would be the same if Carrey's character is from the 1930's or the 1950s and the events have changed for Carrey as the years have gone by, or if the events are too far removed from the book to have Carrey relate to, that is the only way it could work. Carrey was so good as a silent man and, with a very good script, that he could have easily come over to this movie and just played the part of an ordinary guy, and had no reason to play a hero. He just was playing himself. The part of the hero he played wasbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutnotbutbutandthe part where he tries to be a hero isbutbut BUTbutbutbebutbutitandI don't think there's room for him.  There's a hero in this movie in the guise of a super hero, who is fighting a hero (the super hero of the book) and, as the movie progresses, the roles are reversed.  The super hero (in the book), is a villain, who, I think, in the book is portrayed as a very bad guy. Carring the role of the super hero is not only in bad taste, it's an abomination.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think that this was a good movie for two reasons.  The first reason is that people who are going to see this movie as a film like "A Perfect Day for Larry Williams" should see that this movie was just a bunch of people trying to get on the air. I'm not a big fan of doing it that way, with my fellow panelist, Michael Irons. I know that many of us were waiting on this movie to make a statement about Williams and how he is an icon, a great human being.  It has to be a very short movie about five minutes (at the beginning) on the "B" stand.  A second reason is, the reason why I'm looking at the second movie on the list. After I saw the movie for the first time (which was about 15 minutes on the video), I felt that it was a very good and good story for Williams. I don.t know that it's just one story, and not one of a bunch, like many of the people in the audience have seen this movie.  Unfortunately, it was just too short, it wasn't good enough for it to do the "perfect day" story, like the panelist said.    The second thing I've seen Williams do is that he has a big ego, and he likes to show off. Williams is a showman. It's his way of showing off, his confidence, that's what I think he's doing here. I think that he's trying to show that he can be a good actor on the radio.  So, this is what he should do, try and get better, do his best as the actor he can. I hope that he gets his chance to do something that has not been done in the past, like "The Larry Williams Show"  There are many other people that were really good in that show. And, Williams' ego needs to be dealt with, as well, I think, on air, that he really needs to learn to have more humility and realize that he is just like the rest of us, and we're just not all that great in the radio, so he has to deal with it. I can't tell him to leave, as I don the "Williams Show" on the station, and never watch the show again, he's just not there, or he needs to realize that.  I'm sorry that I did this movie, I don-t
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's good about this movie is that it had two stars, and it was the "best of the best" for a musical, which would seem to be the "endorsement" of a star.  I thought it might be about the movie-comic, with it's plot and the music in it's musical form, which I thought would have made for a more interesting film, or even just an OK movie, with this movie, I'd go to the theater to see a "Best of the Best" musical, in order to laugh and enjoy myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the major points of the film is that the lives of these people would change. The problem is that even though there are "special effects" in this film, they don't make this film look like a "special" film in terms of quality, which makes me think that they may be "special effect" films rather than films. I guess it's possible that they'll release the film in "special editions" that could make my point in "extra" detail, though I really don't understand why they would release a complete "film" that has the quality of a bad "film." This film is the real deal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very impressed by the actorsbutbutbutBUTbutbutbecausebutbutthebad acting was awful and I think that maybe somebody who was on this production, could just say that it was the last episode, so I think it was just the last scene of the last show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a big project. At the end of it, I found out that it would not have cost too much to do a smaller film. It seemed more like it would have cost more money to make the film.  There are no good words to say about this film. I wish I could say more about the ending. I have a feeling I didn't really get all of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite TV show and movie is Mystery Science Theater 3000 (the show is still on TBS). I watched this movie on Saturday night at the local Varsity Theatre. The Mystery Science Museum's own video on the Sci Fi Channel (that is "Classic Horror Films"). My wife and I were sitting next to the theater's manager, so they came up with the idea of watching this film. "What a good idea" they thought.  My wife saw a different movie and had a lot more fun. We all have different taste in film and we decided that our movie is better off being released to TBS. I am butbutbutbut but the Varsity, after the first few minutes of the movie, was a complete mess and the film's credits were wrong (they said they were in the film). I believe they were supposed to say "I was in this movie"). There were other minor changes in the movie (like changing the Vee of the lady in the diner at the beginning). The theater had also put up an ad for a horror movie that had the wrong actors in the end credits, which is another change that was not that bad, as it is not the only reason you should see this one). The Varsity was also showing an ad before and after the film called, "The Mystery of the Dead" which was also a different story. They're all in the original Mystery Science Theatre 3000 episodes. I thought that they were going to be in this one as a joke and give me this one for $7, they decided to play along with the joke, and the movie doesn't go back to the future!  My Varsity is not a movie that is worth renting. It is way too long and way too hard. It has terrible special effects, poor acting, bad cinematography, terrible lighting, bad special effects.   The only good thing about the movie is that the music video for the Sci-Fi Channel is one of the last things made before the movie was in theaters, since I believe the director and the guy who was making the movie knew what he was doing, since he had some knowledge of what he could do (and who knew, this was still the 70's and early 80's). There are also too many bad movies. There's the SciFi Channel version of the show, which was awful, even in the 80's.  I recommend you see the Sci fi Channel version, and even then, you're not going
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are only four actors. They are on the show because of good timing. In the actual show they are all in one room. The movie was filmed in a studio with two sets, so the actors went to a location.  The whole movie, which lasts about 90 minutes, is shot at the end of the day on what must have been a low budget and the quality is terrible. I'm not saying that it's a bad film with a good story. It's just a terrible movie with horrible production, bad cast, terrible cinematography and lousy actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been to Hollywood's big productions in the past, in the '30s, '40s, and 50s, all were different kinds of movies, and the same in the late 50s.  If I were to make this into a movie it would be the most outrageous and ridiculous thing that I've ever put in a movie. My first impression of this movie was, what the heck could I possibly give it? That would be because I'm not a man who thinks he's supposed to act like an actor or film producer. I'm also not a huge fan of the film director, Robert Altman, for having directed a bunch of the films he directed, or the way he did 'Who Goes There'. I did see him give a talk about Altman's films and they are a very different kind of movie from this one, he had gone to Hollywood to learn about this kind of thing when he was a teenager and directed a very similar film called 'Whom God Knows' in 'Whose Streets?'.  That's about five years ago, in 1963.  Altman has probably seen this before as well. He doesn't know a lot about film, just about acting and directing. I really think he was trying to get as much of his'real' film making experience as he could out of this project.  The 'film-making-in-the-round' part of this was interesting, it was an interesting idea to have an actual film maker (as opposed to a screenwriter) direct it as he did in the old 'Whodunnit' film (which was based on Altman being an assistant to Altman). The idea of getting a film about the life of a'real person' being made by this guy who knows what he's talking about is intriguing and worth a study.  I'll tell you, even for someone who's never made a movie before, the idea of watching the film again and seeing the 'whole person' is just not going to happen.  All the 'character development' (the notion that you would have the idea in your head that the characters were just sitting in a bar or at a diner and would change as you met them) was really just a bunch more "I can't even get a drink in".   The "humor" was there. The "sociology" was probably more than just that, they had an idea of what the characters might
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts out in a bright light. It was a "love story" and a "coming together" type of thing. But, it is very difficult to keep your eyes open. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have only seen two movies (and this was just in college, but I've always been a lover of the horror genre, and had seen pretty much every film from the 70's and 80's. So I am still in the process of reviewing a lot of films from all genres. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of Bessie and I really liked her. And she was going to do her live show on this weekend in San Francisco, and so that would have been my first instinct, and I am going to watch it again for this movie. It is but the first time I am watching the whole movie and they must not have been able to understand the nuances of her life. I did not even realize it was a big deal until I read this. And it made me sad and sad for no reason, the only reason I gave it. I feel awful, I do not recommend this movie, it will ruin your life.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It took a long time to figure out that the movie was a musical, because I thought I was going to see a comedy with my high school friends who are in the theatre and are laughing at the movie. The "Doll" movie is just a "Dance" movie. I am sad and mad that I wasted my time to see the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, if you can even call it a movie since I guess this is a new form of film and then that's bad.  Second, if this is about a sequel of an earlier movie then I'd have my opinion on that, because I didn't see it, and, if there is any truth to it, it wouldn't surprise me if the first film was "The Big Chill" then the movie is "The Chill," which I'd think I'm supposed to be in the movie for.  There is no such thing as a Chill here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on TV, because I happen to have rented it from Video Nip. The only movie I had seen before was about the film "Fifty Shades of Grey," which is based on the novel "Femme Noir" by Erika Larsen.  I didn't know that "Festival" is a real movie until I got it and was introduced to the cast. My expectations were low and, in a word, I was extremely underwhelmed. A few friends and I, and I think this movie deserves the highest praise.butbutbutjust to be 100% honest, that's pretty much it. "Fisherman's Reel" is not a good movie for anyone with an intellectual interest in the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm afraid to ask for the price of "One Time" and "One Person" in the bargain, and I know it's a low-budget film, and all these people think they know me, but I'm in my 40's and I'm hoping to live long enough to have one more good life.  I hope to see a "movie" that's not so low-rent, and that I'm a part of, one that isn't so terrible. It's a really sad, disappointing movie, one in which all the actors look like they had the same thoughts as the one playing the role of a character who was dying on the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are one of those types who really appreciate reality based movies, this film is for everyone else. There arebutbutbutBUTbutbut BUTbutbutButbutbutandbutbutsobutbuttherebutbutbecause... or, it's like a bad drug... I can say that this film was a movie I could really watch for about two hours. I saw it again this past Saturday after a very long break from work and after a long conversation with my wife (and I still couldn't bring myself to watch it for about an hour straight). I have a very big heart and I truly believe in the message of "The Miracle". But at least one of the actors in the film, as an actor who does not have to wear a mask, was nice and I felt that she was acting in a small role (in this movie). I can think of nothing else to say except that the other characters of these people were the reason this movie got made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is the same as the first one. And, it's just boring. If you like the first movie, you can't even stand up straight for a movie that's 20 years old.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was directed by Mike Flanagan, who wrote some really good, good movies for years in the seventies.  Flanagan is the author of two of the best, best, good "Little House" books by Flanagan and is also a fine writer. He has some good ideas about the way the world works and the way people are kind and generous. If we look at the plot of this movie, it was a lot like the plot in "The Little House" with a couple of exceptions and the most important thing was that the film was never going to be a "Little" House of the Little House series or even a movie about the Little Girl who goes to Little House.  For one, Little House did feature Little House movies from 1939. And a good part of that series, like the "Little Girl Who lives in Little House 4". The Little House is about a little girl who lives in a house, and has a little room for her and her family to live in. The little girl in this film lives in the Little Mansion and her parents have a bedroom in the house (not the little room, the Little Mistress of the Manor) and her mother has her own room. (I think) The Little Lady has her room (in the Mansion) with a little attic and the Little Miss is in her bedroom, and her father lives with her mother (the Little Miss) in her room and her little room (like she had in Little Lady).  I guess the Little Lady can make do with the little attic, but the Little house has a big, big room. I mean, what does this little house have in common with the Little Mother and little girl with a room for them in the little house?   We have a little daughter, a little son, a husband (her father was killed), a husband and wife and two husbands (all of them) with no room for a little lady in it. A little girl would have been OK, for the little lady to sleep with a big man, but it's sad to say, my little girl had a sister who died when she was still little and no one ever said the Little Lord of the House has to go alone...  It also was sad that my husband was so young and just in the hospital at the time and would have to deal with his parents' situation.   The other day, my sister was diagnosed with cancer and she is getting better, so she was very sad
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As much as the movie could be forgiven for being a true story of a real group of soldiers, the real problem is that the real soldiers are dead, and the real movie is about a fictional group of fictional soldiers who are playing out a role. The only thing that the fictional actors are in common is their uniforms, and their real faces in the movie theater, and that is the face of a fictional character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie on Saturday night, I thought I'd be able to enjoy this movie. I'm really sad for the fact that I have to admit this film was pretty good. The acting is not great. In fact, I'm surprised at how bad the movie is. A couple of scenes are actually pretty good, and they are very hard to believe that this film wasn't shot in the beginning, which is a film about the death of a young lady, and she would probably be even more believable than the film's young heroine, Ms. May-June. Maybe this movie was just made by an amature director, just to make some extra money, and so it would be the worst movie ever made... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's all about a group of young people, some of them still in their teens, others older. They've been chosen by the "Gurus" to bring in the millions of dollars that the industry supposedly needs, and to do so they've got a group that just can't seem to put their feet on the ground. The one that said "if you take your shoes off, the movie will be over in 10 minutes" was just as wrong as the one that says "they can't walk" because they can't even walk up a hill. They can't see out of their left eye. They're also the kind of people who just can get into a lot of mischief without actually caring if they get themselves in trouble. What does this movie have in common with "Animal House" or "Scream"? There is one movie about teenagers being teens. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went on a trip to Europe where I was going to see my cousin, and saw that they had just won the "Danish national cup". I was shocked and horrified. The movie had absolutely nothing to do with the beautiful land. A stupid plot, stupid acting and the worst film I've ever seen from the Danish government. It was so bad, and I can't say that it's in English. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you know what I know about horror, you know that there is not going to be a movie with the original cast and then the original director and the original "twin brother" and then two independent filmmakers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For someone with a great knowledge of the show, I would think that it would have been obvious, but it was a little too subtle, and the episode's focus was completely different than what it was originally supposed to be. There were four people in the first episode, and there were five in this episode, for instance, so I guess I missed a few things that I really liked about the first two episodes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I sat with the movie on TV, I looked on IMDb, saw some reviews that were good, people that loved this movie, would I be able to sit and be able take it to the theater, I am a huge fan of the film, but there are a few things that just really do not allow this movie to get the theatrical release.  I was looking for the big one, the reason being that the movie is pretty hard to digest, people's tastes change, people watch a movie when they go into the theater to like it, and they love it.   There is no way that this movie is a film that would get the stamp of "WOW!" The movie is so bad, so bad. It doesn't even qualify for the lowest level of PG. I cannot recommend it, or it will make me wish to see it. I want to leave you with some hope for the film that this is a PG-13 movie and I'm sure it will come out soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the worse movie ever, but it is only one of two movies released in 1993. I have to say that I can't believe that anyone would release this movie because of its quality. It is absolutely horrendous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What really happened in the world of "The Matrix" is a little more than a film about "The Truth" or a little less than a documentary about "Citizen Kane." "The Oracle" is an odd film with one story line and a bunch of characters (with the exception of the girl who plays the Oracle and plays her best part). She also shows off her acting skills in the wrong way. She makes the Oracle look really naive by asking the Oracle questions like, "How do you know everything?" She does not get the "Avenging Angel" look of the Angel, for example, when she talks about her time in the Matrix and is wearing a black uniform as opposed to a white one. Her looks are very much the standard human female and when she is in her office she is dressed in a business suit. "The world of 'The Matrix' was very different from the world we live in today and I'm sure her wardrobe reflects that," she told me, meaning she would not wear a business or office outfit, and not even a proper business suit (like a white blouse). She has a very cute hairstyle and has just been in the business herself so she had to dress in that kind of a fashion.  Her hair and make up do not reflect the "Matrix" look.  I don't care how much she does not want to show that she was the Oracle, this was a mistake that I couldn't stop myself from taking the trouble to shoot. That's a lot of money and I don. I wish I could apologize to the girl in "The Awakening." I will admit that she is beautiful and that there's no need for the business world to change.  If I could forgive her for her look, I would still be glad to see her on "The Business" for an interview about her life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a dumb movie. It's dumb to even think that I'd sit through it. The ending is so stupid. It was so bad, I was really shocked at how awful it was. I just watched it for about five minutes before I actually started looking at the TV. The idea of having any idea of how it all turned out. I would recommend this to anyone who is a huge fan of 80s movies, or any other of those who loved "The Goonies", or any of those cheesy "tween" movies in the 80s, which had a ridiculous end for the stupid end. If you're a fan of anything remotely similar to "The Phantom Menace" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and don't like those movies, I'm sorry for you and I'm embarrassed to sit in front of this pathetic excuse for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two or three actors who are in some degree of movie superstition. This was the worst movie I had ever seen. I have only seen the trailer and the original "Star Wars" films. As a horror movie, you may have an opinion about a good movie or film about an interesting story. I did not want to waste anyone's time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see a preview and it was a really long movie. If you get the DVD copy, it is only about 2 hours and 20 minutes, and the film is in fact about 3 hours long. That is almost 50 minutes of my life devoted to this movie.  It is really really bad! I give this film the "7" rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are interested in reading a novel, or in talking to a person in real life, read a good novel or watch the movie version of A BOOK.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was a good movie about the movie was the idea of two people, one in love and one in lust, where the love would be expressed, not for sexual abuse and torture. And for that reason, I found it very hard to relate to anyone, and very hard even to sit in the chair. I found the movie painful to watch, and I don't think it is worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made in 1994, so by today's standards, there are about 4 million people in the world! And yes, this movie was for kids, so I think it's appropriate for the time that it was made.  It was very "child-like," so even now, in 2014, it is still very "cartoony" in the kids' part, and the kids in the adult part are just as bad as the adult ones, so there are two movies in one. It was also bad because the script was horrible and unbelievable, so horrible in fact that the movie wasn't even worth calling a film, and that's in the English language. There are a bunch of bad-looking people, and bad-dressed people, etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am one of the fans of the show. I remember getting into the show for two weeks when I was a child, and never really letting go of it, and watching it again, I thought I had learned something about the show's characters that would allow me to relate to them as people, or at least to make an attempt. I must say that it was really difficult to relate, to relate at all to any of the characters. The only characters that we could relate to were one or two of the "young" guys who we saw a little bit of in the pilot. In some cases it was just the old-time school boys (think Mike Farrell and Danny Masterson) or maybe Mike's dad (Tom, I think).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really funny how they try to make fun of the fact that one of the "greatest" martial artists in the world used some of the same techniques as this movie. My biggest problem with this movie was how they tried to make a joke of the movie, because it was really painful.  The way the movie is structured is that it goes from a scene where they fight in a martial art class, then the fight is actually about to go in the end...  The movie is about the main character becoming a martial artist. There are some really cool things in the movie about this. Some of the film's plot is about how this film is about "training" him in the art of killing, not about him "killing" his victims. The movie "The Matrix" (the third one) is about Neo and Trinity fighting a whole bunch of bad guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director should have been on my mind the whole time. He was so intent on this movie, he thought he was going to make a film about a real life man. His life is ruined. I felt terrible at the end of the movie. I think the director should not have left this movie to make it, even the slightest bit. I wish I could make this movie into something that was worthwhile, something that could be compared to something like the "The Lost" or even "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."  I was thoroughly disgusted, and did not wish to see this movie ever again. And if you're in your early 20's (or even if you look younger), then you must be able to watch it, just like I was able to finish the last movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My own review was about a "true story" movie with a director and actors who were all "true to life", "true" or whatever else.  The reason I have to give this film the "X" mark, or "F" mark is because of the bad-ad-video, fake-movie look of the movie, that this "Hollywood-style" look was used. The camera was way too far away, the editing was poor, I didn't know who was the main character and it was only a few minutes into the movie. I couldn't believe that there was a "big" city with a big budget for this poor movie, with no hope for it.  This movie was only about a few miles away from my home in Chicago, so I'm willing to bet it was filmed in a small, rural setting, maybe it was supposed to be scary and so forth.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was funny to think that one of our films is based on "The Naked Gun". I didn't see the point of this "feature" that "The Last One" was so they got their money back. The "Last One" is actually a really good horror film with a really great script.  This is a terrible piece of work.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is impossible for me to find out the name of the director and the writer of this film. It is not that difficult to find someone with the names of these two guys.  The acting was bad.  A person has to see it twice to figure out what is wrong with that. A great director, who can make you jump, can make a great film out of this movie. With an excellent cast, an awesome story but, what this movie has now is just a great scriptbut just for the actors to do what they were supposed to do. We have to hope that by the end of the movie, the actors can make an impact with this film, because it is impossible that these guys were in it for a week or two, or a month.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do believe that the movie will be a little more politically incorrect than "Gore Vampires" because I see the movie from the perspective of how a young kid from my town has lived. The film was an idea, and one that I got in my head, that the writer (John) would be very honest in telling the story. The filmmaker, (Dennis), wanted to make a movie about the "true" story, and that was why he came to "Hollywood" to make this movie, but since he got the script, he felt that the film would be a good one to show the "gore." It was only after he showed me the entire film that he felt he could properly convey the "heart of the story." (I don't think it was due to lack of effort, but because the writer was trying to convey his own vision of the movie.)  It's not that the "story" is bad in the sense that it is a poor film because there are some very great scenes in this movie that really move you and you feel as though you are actually there, like when the child kills the vampire and takes his hand and puts it in the wound, and he is very graphic, and you can hear the blood and the scream when he is doing it. However, he just does not want to make an explicit movie, since he is the first filmmaker of the new millennium, in that he did not understand that horror films aren't supposed to be about sex.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame I got to see the show the first time back in 2005 when I got my first "B" DVD, since they might have aired it in the U. What a shame to waste the time and money I had to waste.  I don't know why the guy who made this film is in a rush to see how to find out a cast member, as he's not in for a free ride. It was not a waste of money, but I'm not willing to spend a dollar on it. And since it's my first time doing this, I'm a complete beginner at it, and not that I'm the "poor guy who needs a break" either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was great, I think it was the only true, or, what would you call, reality reality television show about me and my friends, because there was a small part of reality reality TV about me that was on my back. It wasn't great. I was on the couch and a girl was sitting in the sofa, it wasn't about my legs, like it was a male on the sofa or anything, there was nothing more than that. I know it was because I'm an athlete and I'm only 5'3". I'm not as tall as some of the others, and I wasn't as skinny as a lot of them, but I did run track. A little bit of a skinny boy would probably get the same idea.  I was in my underwear, and the shorts were way too tight on me, and then I was like, "well why am I running a half mile on my stomach with tight shorts"? It was a shame really. I'm pretty petite, and not as athletic as a football player, or a football lineman, I didn't look great in that.  As I remember it, I had about 2 or 3 pairs of pants on. The shorts were pretty nice, and they didn't really show off my legs at all, I really had to stand up straight, I got up in front of the camera to make them show that I was petite.  Afterwards I just look forward to getting naked in front, and getting naked with a little more cleavage. Maybe that would have looked better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was all shot and edited during the winter. It's really unbelievable that they even bothered to film this for what it is supposed to be. I can't believe they ever even bothered the film was for all I know about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing this movie on the back of a DVD case, I would have to say that I've had my share of bad movies, and I was looking forward in seeing this. This is the only movie I've ever been in that doesn't have a DVD. I mean really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, if it's good in this movie, then that's not that bad. My main problem with this movie was the fact that it could have been a pretty, simple comedy. I know they tried really hard to convince me otherwise, and they tried very hard to make me think otherwise, I guess you don't get to have it both ways, and I don't think that's just a good thing for a movie like this, when you get into your own house, or, you know, a normal one. There are too many funny things in the world, that you have to let it out and express that way, so I guess it's like one of those things where the funny things don't matter much. The funny guy was pretty good in "Deadbeat" (I saw him as a regular guy), the guy who played him in that movie was hilarious, and in "Manos" he was funny and in his funny way. "Dead Beat" had a lot more people to act with and to make you laugh, and that was what made it so great, but this movie...it wasn't funny. The guy just didn't know his way. And if you have ever seen it with the guy from "DeadBeat", he's pretty funny, and you'll remember that he knew his way, or at least was a funny guy, you'll get the gist of the story pretty quickly.  "Dead beat" was a joke for the two guys that made it, or really the two of them who got married in it, and the guy with the crazy eyes. He was like a comedy, and this guy just thought he'd be funny and he went in for the laugh. And so he's just trying to be funny.   He's a great actor, and he could make jokes, he just doesn't have a funny personality, and while he can do it on the screen, he's too smart to think he'll be able to, because he's a very natural funny guy. He just gets in the head of the film and he doesn't understand that you just want the "funny" guy. This was the second time he went into the movie and just tried to be himself and the second joke was really funny. He tried really, really hard, which I think you should do. He does a great job in the first two films, and for those guys, I think he did a great and wonderful job, in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a little girl and what little girl can she be cute, or who cares about her being cute. I'm in favor of all girls being cute and who don't have this movie in my collection because I'm sure everyone will tell me I'm a hypocrite and I'm hoping the movie will bring me some kind of justice. I like the movie that came before, 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Maybe one day, or after 'Little Sister'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story starts with a very interesting (and, to a certain degree, very interesting) idea to show that the story was the first of all and the only thing the audience could do was to see what happened to those who are still alive in the first one. They don't know anything and, with the exception of a couple of actors, they were totally clueless about the entire thing. It is, to put it frankly, beyond bizarre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always been interested in the way these guys did their work as a boxer. They are just not there. They should not be allowed to be in the ring. In the end, all they do is look at the clock, which is all they should be doing. When it comes down to it being a real fight, they do not deserve to have their names on any kind of a championship belt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad thriller about the worst actor in the history of the world. He looks like he has aged 25 years and there are only two actors who are in their 60s who have seen his face before. If they were in their 70s, the movie would have been over 10 minutes long.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was in some kind of an adult "guide" to an adult audience (which could be confusing). This movie isn't even about an adult comedy at all. The movie starts out with the main character waking up from a coma. A lot of the movie's time is devoted to talking about and analyzing the coma. That would be funny, especially if it was in the hospital where the characters are recovering. There's nothing funny about a movie called "My Brain's On Fire," the only thing funny in this movie is the ending. That's because "My Cane" is going to be the first big film to air on ABC, as "My Life Story." In addition, the movie is going be on ABC (and presumably other channels) on Monday, and Monday morning. As I was watching it on Monday afternoon, I got a call to talk to the ABC production department, so that's how the "My life story" piece was shown on my TV in the middle of the afternoon. I really didn't want to be wasting my time, so I called my mom. The only reason I was there on Monday was to catch "My Man With The TV." It's the kind of movie where you really don't want your brain on fire, so my "My brain's on fire" piece gets aired after my wife and I watch this. This is a comedy about a neuropsychologist, not a neuro-psycho. This movie doesn't have a good story, and a really lame neuro-psychological approach. The characters are not funny, the writing is atrocious, and the movie can't take the worst kind of shock.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen some reviews from people who were offended by this movie because of a few people in the theater, I feel pretty bad for the "movie of the year" award. It's the only movie that I can watch with my eyes.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is a remake of "The Producers" in 1974. It does look like that this was made in 1976 (like "The Studio" is made in 1977) which could explain why it's listed as "The Film Production". The reason I watch it on VHS is because of the "special features" (I'll talk about that). They are a few pieces of music (including a remake that is available on CD), which are from the original film. The original film had so many "special feature" pieces that they had to be available as part of a "Special Edition".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know who "they" are. I do know that it's "their" fault that I'm the poster of this film. It is their responsibility to prove to the world who they are and who they really are, without shame or dishonor. It will take my time, as well as their time to prove their innocence. It would be good to get this message across to the other actors, and it's obvious that the film is going to play out in a very slow way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems everyone in Hollywood is obsessed with this movie.  It's so bad that it could've been an independent film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm pretty sure this movie got made with the intention of being released for DVD, because I'm sure it's going to be released on some kind of big screen. I've seen the original, a lot more than a couple years back, and I didn't really like it, not because of its quality, I thought the movie did a really good job of capturing the mood of the movie,butbutbut but I can't say it was perfect because that was only one director's movie, and some of the editing seemed to go on a bit too long, for instance, there's a scene at the beginning of the film, when the three of them are looking at the wall and are talking about how it's been painted. This is not an action film, and it takes on the role of being the one and only movie directed by one person. I guess I could always expect to see that, which might mean that I'm missing something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the "The Great White Shark" in the movie "Sharktopus" and saw how great the shark was, this movie, along with the other movie were like a poorly made "shark".  This movie was so bad I didn't even finish watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens with this line:  "In the past."  This is the opening scene, and the first thing I thought was, "This will be like 'Tremors', the first 'Tron' movie" and the title alone would put this as the sequel to the "Tremers."  If you are thinking of a "Tron" movie, you will have no idea what the hell is going on. The only thing worth seeing is "Trombonist" and "Tobarnizer", which is just terrible. This is awful bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people know what happened. Some know what actually happened. I didn't like that it had to do with her mother's death. I don't know what was in the mind of someone who thought it was appropriate for her to make her grandmother (that's a real person, not a doll) wear that in a way that would have her grandmother wear it. I think it was a very sad, depressing film, not just about how some awful woman murdered her mother. It has an overreaction to the idea that the killer was someone who was a person with a conscience. It's like "it was a terrible man, and she was a wonderful woman".  I think this is a movie that needs to appeal to the "average" female movie-goer, not women that have a deep interest in a "real-life crime". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is my understanding that the movie was made under the supervision of Roger Ebert. That is the only person who has the right to be in charge of making these judgments. As Roger E, I say, stay away from this movie, and watch it if you are going to watch the movie to see the great movie that is "Roger Rabbit" instead. I can say, if you enjoy it, you will enjoy it. The problem is, is this one of them bad movies? I hope that is the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was funny, funny. In the case of this movie, I had to laugh about it, then smile about it. I mean, what are you going to do when you get off the train? Do you really want to take a picture of yourself with me? I was extremely tired by the end of the movie, and that's before considering the film's length, length of time (8 hours), the film was full of long, drawn-out scenes.  I don't know about you, but for the life of me, I didn't like this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For what the film was about I was quite surprised about how big the studio release version is. Also, the original "The Wizard" was a good 3-4 minutes and there are lots of clips in the first one, which were either a little less of a cartoon, like, for instance, a "Wizard" short and a short segment in which a couple of kids are talking. The second "Wizards" film is over two hours long, not even counting commercials. The reason is simple: The "W'rk" team is one of the few who actually made the short film that was released a few years back, and, I can guarantee it, there is no sense in releasing this new film. It's just a new version of a new film (the short "W'"rk").  The animation and photography were both pretty good (since "W'," the short "Kr'"r Kr", was pretty crappy by comparison), since they were done by people who made the original short film, since the W'rks had little shorts that were released in 1938, the short is dated 1939.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie (The First Man) was a movie about an intelligent animal, it was made of black and white and the whole of the first man's story. It was a beautiful story with beautiful dinosaurs, and it is a good movie and will probably appeal to all the children. It won't have the impact of this one because it's very strange and confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a very sad movie about a tragic situation. That's what happens in this film.  I felt so bad for the actor, I don't know how he could've acted. He's not good at all, and so is that director's idea of a movie. It's an awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was curious what my fellow critics would say. I was intrigued as to see how the guys would hold their position with the camera. A man should not go into such a role. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this in my hometown of Milwaukee. The first time that I saw this movie was a little over 30 years ago on the "L'Ami du Nord", in a theatre and, you may have seen it, when I saw it on VHS, I went into the theatre. I didn't know that I was going to be in this town, so I didn`t know the local movie theatres, and when I arrived in town, I saw the movie in the new theatre that it has, so my experience with this movie is that it`s in a completely different theatre. So, not only does it change the movie (since it`d have to be from reel to DVD) but the experience is totallybutbutbutdifferent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the producers said to me, when this was first released that this would be a really funny movie, so they'll know how to market it. I guess I can't blame him for trying to sell a movie that wasn't as good as it can be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really curious to watch the film based on some of the other reviews. I thought that after reading the book, I was a little more inclined to watch this film based solely on my interest in the novel, given the subject matter. I wasn't expecting this film to be so dark and heavy. I don't think anyone expected this film. It's like the people of Ireland are not supposed to experience this... it's almost like the Irish want to break out in tears at some of these scenes... like the scene in the movie where they are all lined up to receive the punishment.  The cinematography is absolutely horrendous, it's a mess, it really isn't interesting, and it's all one continuous scene with some horrible, horrible sound effects. The story is just horrible... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie boring. The actors are not funny and if you like some serious character study this could be entertaining.  I don't like that it's a comedy. It was very silly and very unbelievable. Some people, like "Gilligan" and "Nolan" like to do this movie and like to tell how much better I am at acting, so maybe they had a good idea about this film, or maybe this was the beginning of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I saw it was because the Criterion edition came out. I'd been watching the Critically-acclaimed edition on VHS, and it had a little bit of a story to the film. So this is a really bad film. It has an all-white background, and the only reason that's not all-black is because it was filmed in the same style as the Criticals' movie, and in the beginning when it looked all black, it was white again.  I'm not going to lie to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It wasn't that bad because the actors who were pretty good. There were really good actors and they knew it would be a film with lots of money. After a couple of years, I feel like the movie just isn't all that good. This movie was just awful. The story was unbelievable. It was just so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I would like to point out that this is a "poster film", that is a film that you buy at a movie theater. Also, I was surprised that the majority of people who viewed this film were actually really funny and creative, they just weren't funny.  The movie had a great story about a "little man" named Jimmy, but the characters were dumb. The ending was the worst possible ending to a film I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm an actress, so I know what I want when I want to play a lead role in a movie.   The other woman I played with in the movie, Ms. Statham, does a lot of her own stunts, so she has no need for a stunt double for her next movie. She's really not the kind of lady that needs to be in the movies. If you like her you can see a movie called "The Rock" in which she's in the ring with all the other wrestlers. If she's a pretty girl in a bikini in a scene like this one, you know how hard it is for her to keep from becoming naked in front of the cameras. She has a natural athletic figure. What I did with her was not to do something with her body type and I know that my daughter has never seen her naked and she was a big fan of the way she looked in a video for her very first movie in 1996.  This was a really bad movie. I don't even want to know what the other person was doing in the gym to get in shape like she was. If it was that hard to keep her body toned, I would have gone ahead and done my job, gotten into shape and gone for it. You can't make it look good in a way, and the movie was a complete waste of my time and the money I wasted on it.

I find that in the last 50 years, it was a time-honored art form that was in the hands of professionals. I hope to find it within myself, and it doesn't take long.but at the same time it still doesn't look good on the big screen, because in order to put a film together, you have to shoot it with some special effect. I love everything about film, but that's not the same as a movie with a large budget, which is why there are two other films in the "film" category, one of them with "effects" (I can't remember what it is called, but it's one of those "special effects" films in France). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what really went on at that event or what they had for the DVD that day, but I had my suspicions that this film would follow the pattern of "Mysterious X-Files".   This was a horror film first, and it had been a really great horror film, that the one made by Peter Green with "The Sixth Sense". And I was curious to see if it would be as scary, as this one, since the premise of the film was based on the "Mystery in the Park", or, since it was made by a few of the actors and producers involved in that movie, that it would not be about the mystery that "The Six Sense" was about.  As such, I think that people really should watch that film, before this one and judge this film on the premise that it's just a horror flick and not really based on any real premise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't mind it at all. I liked the movie and it could be in a remake, the same director, the cast, but it is so bad! If you want to watch it for it's very short film version (like 5 minutes) I will recommend that you rent this. It's pathetic, a real piece of garbage, if you are in the same situation I was in. And what is worse is, that it's a really funny, very silly movie with very stupid stuff happen, like the stupid dog scene, stupid characters and dumb comedy, so it just ruins your night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I don't really consider this a horror movie. The movie was really an adaptation of the work.  I really thought that if the movie were about a writer and a filmmaker it would be good enough that people would see a bit more of how a writer's work is done. I really don't understand how the producers of the film saw this as their way of making a film. Maybe, like me, they see that this is some sort of a film that people will be like, a film made by the likes of David Lynch, which is not meant to be serious, or to be a sort of low budget film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of making a movie about the life of a "professional" golfer was interesting. I'd like to see a movie that's not about the golfer himself but about other people in his life. The movie starts with the golffeeman's childhood. There's not enough time for the rest of the characters to be developed and not to mention the lack of a proper ending that leaves us with a bad feeling after watching the movie and with a feeling of relief after watching it again. There was a great idea in the movie "the GOLF" in which a golfer would have had to endure the entire movie to make a big impact on his sport and a great storyline that was portrayed by Tom Johnson. I'm a huge golfer and believe it or not, I loved the movie GOLFRAME. In addition to being filmed in the 1940s and filmed at the San Francisco Golf Course, the story was about a good golfing sport and would have been well captured in the golf course scenes at the start of the movie, so I hope that the producers will get a hold of the scriptwriter and let him or her go back to San Francisco to finish the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got really good comments from people who saw "The Girl Who Knew Too Much" and had been to some of those conventions. There was a lot of knowledge in "The Producers", so I thought that they would be able to bring the knowledge and wisdom from the "B" to "B". I'm going to say, that if you can get a copy of "The Woman Who Got Pregnant", then you will be able view the documentary.  I'm sure that the documentary had a lot to do with all the people who were involved in this story. If you don't read the book, you'd get an idea of what the story was about, and there isn't much time to waste.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought this film would be a big, independent production for the whole world to see. The movie has been released in the UK and Australia. The same is true of the US, so my thoughts are that this is probably the biggest production of it's kind, that's what the marketing campaign says, and then the movie. I don't think there's really a good reason for this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have just seen it, and had to watch it again (with all the friends and family), so I am a member of the cast, and have to watch this again, but this is not a really good movie. The movie starts as a really great movie about an ex-soldier who becomes the new Sheriff, and he goes on and on about how the old Sheriff had no morals, etc. He is portrayed by Paul Muni, who is probably the best actor of the whole film. He was a real hero. The one who tries to take the moral high ground and do the best for the town. Paul is a very good actor who is a great actor, and this film needs to be taken seriously as an artistic piece. I think that Paul Munn is the best candidate to play Sheriff Nick Adams, and here he is going up against some of the best people in the business in Paul Muncie, and I think he should get this job. If Paul can win, this movie will be a great thing for him. If not, he should have gotten some help from Nick Adams about his part.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie's story line is simply a collection of events. There's no real development. There are two main reasons for this. The first is that the director had the opportunity to film the last scene, in which we see the two leads, and so was able to capture some footage that would have helped clarify this situation. This scene shows up after about 20 minutes of filming. (I was at a film festival in Toronto where it was showing at Toronto International Film Festival, and one of my co-workers at the festival was the guy who shot it. He didn't know that this scene was actually to be shown in the film.) The second reason is that it was a two hour movie.  This movie is like a 100 minutes long.  In the first movie, there was some pretty intense stuff happening. The movie takes place in a world of "The Machine" or the "Machine Empire." You get to know a lot about the Machine, and it seems pretty cool. The machine seems pretty formidable, especially with all the soldiers and machines that fight there. In this movie, you get no real clue as to the Machine and its inner workings.  The film also tries to go into some sort of depth on the character of the Machine. We see a lot of the background that goes on with "The System" which is the Machine that runs the entire system of the film. We're also given a lot more insight into the Machine (aside from "The Director"). The Machine that's running the movie doesn't really have the slightest clue about who the Machine is.   It's obvious that the makers of this film wanted us to think about the main characters, and they also made a point of showing the Machine's evolution (which is the one that really matters). We learn how the Machine came into existence, how the machine learned how to kill humans, etc. This movie has no such point of interest. This film is a "movie" about the "final confrontation" with the Machine - which doesn't even take into account the Machine having made a decision to kill the human it is fighting, or how it might be made to work out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no idea what to expect of this movie. My curiosity was piqued by some of the great reviews posted in IMDb. I figured this would be one of the first reviews I would read that was a few years old. I was expecting something pretty much the same as the first movie. This is my second viewing. I didn't like the film because of it's lack of direction. I don't think it's the fault of the actors, because a majority of it was done by someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To me, this is "The Lost" or "The Dead." I'm not sure exactly how to explain why I'm wasting time. It's unfortunate. I give this movie a 7 out of 10 for acting and production but it's just the worst movie I've ever seen. It isn't even a movie to watch alone!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked 'Sneakers' and I loved "Sneaker Wars," the Sneaker Wars and I even liked that series. I watched Sneakers 2 at home because I was a home movie and I had my 'S' on.  Sneakers Wars 2 was pretty bad. I loved how "Sno-Glove," I used to play all those years ago, I still have that 'S.' I have seen it many times, I will have a discussion about it in the comments. If you look closely at the 'Sno-'Glove,' you can still see that tiny spot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the biggest fan of Woody Allen. As I understand he just turned 30 years old. I think he's been at it his whole life. This was the second of two "Woody Allen films" that are available on DVD, and the first one was "Play It Again". I guess that makes sense...  This was only available in the U.S. at the end of January, so I didn't pay attention to it, and I would have to apologize for that. That's not an accident.  It was very very disappointing. I saw it for the first time in New York, when I rented it (before this), and I didn DREAMED that I would love it, I didn"T like it. I really want to see "Play it Again".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first half of the movie was very good: it's the beginning of the story where most people go, and there is that sort of pre-teen angst, or something along those lines.  So this is another story with an all female cast, and what with the idea of a female leading male lead, it just sort of happens. It's not even that they can get me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has been made to promote this film to the general public, and to this day, I haven't seen a single public-service announcement, and I can't understand why this film is trying to pass itself off as a documentary of a story that was once told, the film's ending just doesn't make sense. The first and best thing about this movie is the cast; if you're a die-hard fan of Christopher Walken or the late Michael Caine, you'd expect a very well-made, cinematic, story about a person's life.  The story and acting is so great, and even though the casting was the problem, the story would still be worthwhile.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts out in the US, the UK, New Zealand, the Netherlands, France, Canada, the US. So this film is based on the "Dutch West Indies". So, this film can't be used for a simple review. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was an 8. It was not a "9" or "10".  This movie has no story. It has no character. The only thing that kept this movie from being at least 2 hour long is that I'm a big film buff, and that I didn't want it to end on the big screen.  And for all you film junkies out there, there is nothing I can compare it to, and it is so awful that you want to give it away and see how horrible it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the whole concept of making movies for "fame", or some kind of "heroes" really didn't take hold here. Maybe they had to make the film with some special effects. There were people in the audience who knew the characters intimately and were probably very good actors. They probably had more to say than the rest of the audience. They knew what the characters were trying to do, they knew why they were there.  It was bad by far, not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a result of this movie I don't know what to say, except that this is a real "D" movie. This movie is about two guys (one who is black) who are looking for a woman, they're not from Canada, and Canada's national film and television council has officially condemned it.  It is an attempt to sell it's supposed to be "an international, artistic expression", it's bad, and, frankly, there's no need for it. The movie is not a true and complete statement, not a good idea, and you can read the end without having to watch it. Also, if you're Canadian (like me), this is, like, a lot of Americans. It is a disgrace to the entire country. (I think there's a movie being made right now).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After two days of sleep, I got up this morning and rented this movie. If the reviews were correct, this movie would have been about a "how to" film, but even if the reviews are correct, they are only half accurate. As a result, I give this film a rating of 4 for the following reasons:  The first reason is that I am a big fan of the movie. I have seen it in a few theaters, the original version.   The movie is rated with an R, a thriller. If I gave this movie an R rating, I'm sure this is the one that will be made for DVD. The original movie was the only one that was on the DVD I think, and I don't remember it being rated at all.  (It's too bad, because the movie is a lot better, and should be on DVD)  The second reason is because the film is very much based on a true story, but it is based on "old" technology.  I mean, if you're going to make a comedy, you make a movie for a few years and see how to make comedy movies, you don't make a horror movie about the horror movie, or vice versa.  As a final comment, this is a horror film that was originally released in 1973. The late 70's were the last time that the majority of the American public saw a movie with no special effects, and we didn't have the same technology of technology as the world had during the early 70's when the movie was released in 1975, when a special effect, computer animation, etc. weren't available, either. Also, the majority, or maybe all of the films that were made during the 1970's, were made for the horror industry, which I guess is where the R rating comes from. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to think that I am more open-minded than most, especially if it was my opinion that the film was supposed to be "The story of life" or "Life of the most interesting person in the world," perhaps that was the reason for watching the movie in the first place, or maybe I got lost in the shuffle of trying to find a good ending. To this day, it's a little hard to see the film as one of the many Hollywood films in existence, although some have put it out there on DVD, and I found out about it here on IMDb, and you have to give a movie a title that's meant to convey to you the message that it's intended to be about, and this is something that the filmmaker did not take the time to do, and that's what makes the movie so sad to watch it on the screen. I give it this: I found it a real bummer! I recommend this movie to everyone who loves sad films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got my hands on this movie by chance. I'm a big fan of John Carpenter's work, and I still believe that his work is excellent, and his influence is felt throughout this but this movie was shot by "B" himself. As the film progresses, the film gets more complicated, and this is particularly noticeable in the way that the story is told.  John Carpenter himself explains this situation at the end of the movie, in a rather heartbreaking scene where he describes how he was given a script to write "A lot of movies you make films to play out this very simple plot," and his advice was to make the film more like his "B movie."  One of the most important things to realize here is that it was this way with John Carpenter, where his style of film-making is simple and direct.  It was his style which helped inform the storyline and make the movie.but not all people are like that.  In this film, John Carpenter had been given a much more complicated film to work on. He, unfortunately, was at least partially responsible for this situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film about a group of people who have gathered in a small town for the purposes of a church.  The characters in this film are all drawn from the same town, and most of them have the same personalities (or lack thereof) - no personality in a town of two or three hundred people, or a town with half a dozen people.  As, one of the main characters, the town doctor is from a rural village, the doctor from the town hospital is from the city (which is a doctor, by the way), and so is the town Sheriff (who is a real doctor and not a policeman), and there's a very good reason for it (for example, most of the townsfolk had nothing in common with him prior to this movie). The character of one of these people is not just a complete stranger - he is a complete fool. The other one is a dumb girl.    I wish I could tell you that I didn't really care about this movie. I wish to god that it didn't have such a low score on IMDB because I wanted to waste money on it, because this is a low-budget film - not a film for you to rent and watch (unless you are willing to spend your money), and its low budget makes it difficult to make a film that is more like a documentary.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very poorly directed movie, with the actors being mostly the "actors", with the soundtrack making up the "music". This film has a bunch of really good actors and I think it deserved a good review. It's been made into a nice "movie" and should be released.  I really want to see how this movie ends up, and I hope it ends up in a good film. This film was a big hit with the director and a bunch, if not all, of the cast, in "Grim Fandango", so if anyone can release it, that would be the best one to make a sequel to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it was a TV movie; and it has to be put into perspective that this movie is the first in the series (i.e. the pilot, which was pretty good).   The pilot episode, "Lighthouse," was pretty great.  A man and woman were alone in a cave, their relationship was at its peak and they were in love. In "Tilted," the couple had already been to the wedding, and their relationship continued throughout the pilot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is probably best compared to "A Streetcar Named Desire" and I would recommend watching that movie because it would make some sense. I would also like to note that the "Macho Man" shorts were only one-and-one hour in length. This was a one hour movie.  The reason that this movie is "so long" is because of the film production. "It was a stupid idea, to tell you the truth, but it was an experiment of a sort," said filmmaker/writer-turned-screenwriter-Michael Sossek when I asked him why he chose to do this film. He has been a member of this very small film community. I have no idea what his motivations were. He is now making the film, and he needs to get his stuff together and figure this movie out! There are only two actors who played themselves. They are the two main characters, and I believe they were great actors. I just wish I had seen it.  I hope Soscek did get his money back for "The Man in the Moon." And the other man, whom he plays in the final scenes of the movie. Michael Sossei is not played by Sosser at all.  One more reason for this movie being such a one-hour film was because they had to shoot the whole thing on one set for the entire film. Sossey plays a guy who works as a photographer on the set, so his character's face is completely obscured. "The Mancatcher" is a "man with a camera" and Michael Soso's character is the "man on the street." If you watch the film and have seen Sosso on "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," you will notice him in the "Man With the Camera" scene, and it is the man with the camera who is in this scene with Michael Sosa. If you have seen "The Incredible Sos," you would notice his character was in the film for a total of two minutes, so it was a bit of a shocker to see him being in the same scene with Sossein. If I hadn't had seen "Man with the Camera," I might have thought the story was about the "great detective and great investigator." If I did, I would have been totally confused by this. "You've got a good one," says Sossel to the camera when Sosie asks him a question about what happened

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this for my wife and her friend, and I watched it for my own entertainment. If you are reading this review, please be a little more objective and see a few movies for yourself. I was very angry and upset because, after reading the film, I just knew I had to watch this and give it some life, so I saw some clips and found that the director had made some changes and I think they actually did make a decent effort with this. It's just that people, the audience, and the reviewers themselves are not objective observers. So, I'm left to say that I just couldn't be objective about what was being presented to me, and when I went to watch the movie, my opinion of it has to be, if this movie were a true documentary of an actual documentary-filmmaking, I would consider the movie a failure, not because of any fault of the acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not for everyone. It is about the American Dream, which is why it came to be. In the film, you will meet people that are poor or have jobs that require very little. It will be an exercise to see how well they pull the pull-up, which I believe will bring you to think about your own financial standing. In this movie, the film is about "how the pull up" which is the American Pull Up Team, and their attempts at pulling the "American Dream" and not the American's Dream, and, in my opinion, it was about too many "American" people that think they were really getting involved, "making a difference" and actually making it look like they were, and what that looks like when they finally are done, and if you are doing it yourself, how well you pull your own pull-ups and what happens when you actually are done. It's a pretty gross film with the "Prestigious" cast and I'm not going to give it a rating, even though that is the best-looking one, because I don't want it to become part of the American History Book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on an actual book of a play.  I'm not talking about a play with a cast of 150 people. It's about 20 or 30 actors who are going to be performing in a theater. I don't really know how they are going raise those actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really an "American movie" made in New York, in an attempt to sell the movie to a national audience.  I was a huge fan of the first "Superman" film, and I had only seen it in the US in the late 70's and early 80's, which was made in 1968, the "Man of Steel" has had his story told on the big screen before, so I guess I have some personal investment in this film.  As Man of Steel was originally conceived, he would have been a little smaller, and he would still be a man of roughly the same size, so he's definitely the same height as my dad.  The Man of Tomorrow is much less muscular than he had been in the comic books. His eyes are smaller, which is odd for him to have been able to keep an athletic build. I'm guessing that this is due to his more delicate, younger frame. He's no longer at that ridiculous "Super-Sizing" phase.  There was a rumor going around that he was in need of some extra work on the body because he was trying to emulate Superman, and this is what this film is all about. So I guess he's got a different body than in the comics, and that's all it takes. The other rumor, that he looked so much like the original Man of steel, is totally untrue, as is the rumor of him having green hair and green eyes, and the rumor that he had some kind of secret identity, or had been cast as a woman in the past, because they never show it in any of the trailers. I think that we're also seeing him in the trailer in black, which leads me to believe that he's really getting his powers (his super-strength) for the first time, or maybe he's just getting his hair dyed to match his new look. And I know there's more than one version of Superman, so in another decade or so, we'll see him in costume, I think the one in black would be the same man he is now, he's a little older (he's almost 30) and there's a few wrinkles on his face. There's also a big difference in the color of his face, which changes from dark to light throughout the film, so the new Man of Hope doesn't have the same face as he had in his comics debut, and it's really hard to see the new one, in a way.

The only really notable difference is that the film is titled "The Others". Other than that, this film is just a continuation of the same old material.

The only difference is that the film is over-the-top in the final act. So, in that final act, the "film" has taken on a whole new dimension.  You see it on the television show, which in a sense, is supposed to be a commentary on the end-of-the world.  I think it's hard to say, "what" it is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the third installment in a trilogy of "The Naked Gun", and so far the other two have been pretty good and pretty accurate depictions of the plot. So I was expecting this one to be another, and indeed I'm sure this one had been made in Hollywood at some point in its history. It's just that I couldn't understand the reasoning for this movie, and I'm not sure whether to be the director, the actor or the audience. I've seen the naked body in a movie before, which is not that hard to understand. When the naked nude woman comes in for a sex scene, she is portrayed like it's some sort of a performance piece, and that is just plain stupid and embarrassing, and so bad that I'm surprised anyone would be cast to do it.  The nudity, which was not censored, should be in the movie as well, but that might be more shocking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the movie with the help of a fellow movie-goer, a movie guide, and other movie-film enthusiasts. My movie guide had me convinced that I was going to see a movie about a group of friends who had grown up together in a small town. That I was the only one in the audience who would ever have an interest in the movie, and the movie-guide, with her very limited knowledge of the true story, completely misjudged the movie. The movie was not all a comedy, which is what it should have been, because it is all about friendship between people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think the film would've been called "Naked Gun", which is one of its titles, although there are definitely naked people in the film.  It's possible to find nude scenes in movies.  In the context of the film, you have to understand that when one of the two leads (Wendell) is naked, the other is not, and, I think, is fair. In the scene where he and Iggy are naked in the back of a van, he is in his own personal time, and his personal time is the only thing that should be considered nude, the scene in the van with the guy, where Iggy and I think there's a couple naked people and one or two other people. I don to think that it is fair to say that he is naked in his personal vehicle, or, for that matter, that Wendell is in one of his personal cars, in the context. (Not that he has been accused of doing anything wrong. I think they have a point in saying that he's not acting on his body, but in the case of the Van Scene.) In my opinion, it makes the film look like it's filmed in a '60's "documentary" instead of like an '80's independent film. At least it looks like that Wendy's body was shot in a very short-sighted, unemotionally-directed film. It would be interesting to see the film in a more contemporary context, since he was a very handsome man and very handsome for his time.

So, if you want to avoid that and go to see it, then you are stuck with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just one hour long. (Seriously, what movie is?) And the guy who plays Billy West is really bad and I don't know why he ended up on the show. His character looks like he's on TV and his teeth just like he was in the show he used to portray on "Happy Days". And I don I really have to be honest and say that if you had a chance, you'd just like to see this movie, because it's actually "Happy". I don' know what's going to happen with that part. This movie makes you want to see it but you have to pay for it and go into it expecting to have a lot of fun. It's not out of the question to do it like the show is, I'll give it that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was a child, I grew up watching Disney movies. The animation, the story, all of it was very good.  What I see in this film is a huge failure in a lot of the animators. A lot of them are still working. So I don't really care about animating it anymore. It's not the worst movie in the world, but it is not really my favorite Disney movie either. I think it is an interesting way of making a Disney film and a serious "art" piece. I'm not really interested in a movie about "fantasy" that's a Disney movie at all and I'm a fan of many Disney classics, so I will watch that. I like it's a serious story about a Disney heroine and I thought the movie was a success with it. I love the fact that Princess Merida is not just a pretty girl.  I hope that this movie is really a movie with a happy ending, but I'd really like to see the animation do justice to the story. This movie is not about the life of a heroine anymore than a comedy about a comedy. In conclusion, I would recommend this movie to people who really liked this movie. The animators have to take some responsibility for this mess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a huge fan of the first Alien, and that was an almost completely silent film, but I loved the way this first film was so atmospheric, it was like a movie was being projected, and the way it looked was beautiful. The only problem that I can see was the sound in the Alien itself, because there was a bunch of screaming, and those were basically all the actors, and so there's a little bit of sound in there, and I'm guessing the same effect would have been put out in the first movie, or they were actually screaming, or something like that. It doesn't sound like a normal human scream, and it doesn't have a very deep tone either, and you can't really tell how close they are to you... but the second movie didn't really give me much, and when I thought back on the first one, I found myself thinking about some of the little details, like, "How did they find the aliens in the second film?" The sound was completely different and the atmosphere was totally different. They really needed to do an effect with the Alien, because the Alien doesn't really have any presence. I thought it looked pretty good, and in the end I really liked it in the film, and there were a lot of great scenes, and one scene in particular, but it really just felt artificial and fake to me. I found the first creature had a sort of a little smile on his face and the alien's skin sort of had a little texture, which looked much more natural, because he was all wrinkled. The alien's face was really like an alien's expressionless face. I don't want to be rude to the director, because I liked the look of the second one, and thought that he'd just use a lot more of the "look at the face" type of effect, but then again, that's my opinion, and he's totally free to use the effect anyway he wants, and use the computer graphics for it, I just found it weird to have this creature look like it's going through all these really elaborate changes.   As for the Alien's voice itself, it does sound sort of robotic and cold and hard. This is a totally natural and cute-sounding voice to make, and to be honest, I'd have to assume it had to be done that way, because otherwise it wouldn't have made it into the final film, which is why the first film had its mouth open and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this movie for the sequel, which was a sequel to "Mockingjay", and also was directed by Toby Stephens. I have to say that the sequel was the best, so the sequel might be in my memory as a sequel, so to answer that question... this movie is a mess of it's own. It has horrible special effects, the special effects for the movie is bad, it has a terrible plot, bad character development, bad script, poor direction, and bad music...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I am typing this review, I have been watching this movie for 3 days now. I am not really sure why they released this movie. It is a total waste of time, and there is no redeeming value in the way this film was made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing that comes to my mind is the fact that this was the only thing that came to town with me.  The second thing is that it is a remake of a movie I did back in the 70s, that I am sure most people like the original. For the rest of you, I would just recommend the original, or any other movie that could get you out of this one. I would rather spend my time doing something more productive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this film in theaters, I can't take the movie seriously. I'll give it a 7 out of 10 on the quality of the movie. I think it would be a much better film in color, I'm not sure if I could find it. I'm sorry, it is truly horrible, horrible, and horrible. I would like to recommend this film to anyone who's gonna see this and if you're in the mood for a really good horror flick, I'd recommend it to everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about the second-most expensive film I've ever seen, so it's not like I have nothing to give. The second-highest grossing film I have was Titanic, and you know, I just think that this is one big disaster movie. The only film that could possibly come close is Titanic 2, which would have an iceberg and have a submarine and such. Oh, my goodness. It is all about how it comes to life.  I'm still not sure why a film like this ever got made. My advice is to rent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a pretty hard time understanding how people can watch movies of this nature.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this movie thinking that this would be a comedy. I was looking at this movie from the New York City-based movie club. A friend of mine who is from New Jersey, and who is a fellow movie-goer, pointed out that this movie was not really about "the movie." It was more like "a movie about this movie." I feel it should have been called "The Movie." I can't really comment on the quality of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To this day, I still haven't seen a really good review. In this review, I will do what I can. This movie starts off pretty good. As I remember, I have to say that I was an avid horror movie buff, so I will give that, the movie being released on a Friday night in a store on Broadway with an opening weekend crowd, I guess they were looking for a scare. They didn't have the great ratings of "The Omen". The story begins with a woman, played by the great Bette Davis, who is being taken to an insane asylum. The story is pretty good (with Davis playing her role as a fairly strong woman). In fact, Bette plays a character who is in a mental institution herself. It is just that Davis is playing the same character with a different name, Betette Davis. The name change, which is the reason for the story change is not completely out of the ordinary. In fact Bette, herself, was once called Bette Bette. After leaving the Asylum, Davis had to change her name to something more feminine, which explains this new name change. It was an "unfair" comparison of Davis, whose mother was called Betty Davis, to Davis' mother, and the other way around. Davis' story is not the same, with the addition of Davis' father, who doesn't come out of this movie. Davis becomes Bette's sister, and Davis' older sister in the same hospital, and then plays Davis' biological mother and step-father (not her biological father), who are all married to each other. Davis has to go through her step-brother's marriage, since Davis' stepfather is deceased. Also, Davis was raised by her stepfather, rather than her mother. And Davis has more of a natural father in the form of her father than Bette does. The film plays with Davis' character somewhat, although Bette was more of the "monster" in the film. Davis is not really good actress (or too thin). She is always very nice, and her acting is good (even in the insane asylum scenes). It is one of Davis more "good looking" roles. She looks great in her long blonde hair and her breasts. I'm just a sucker for this type of role. I think Davis' hair is pretty long. She had great hair. Bette has a little more "hair on the sides". Davis would be a better fit

It has come to my attention that I'm not alone in this film. There's no reason for this movie. What was I paying $7 for?

It looks like a good movie, it might be in the theater, and there's a little bit of everything that's going to happen in a movie--the story, the acting, the music--it's a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a truly horrible piece of work, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever!  It's an insult to everyone who ever worked hard to get that movie made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll give it, I liked Richard Chamberlain, and had seen him in "The Goonies" and "The Lost" when he played the sheriff. That was the main reason why I went to see this movie. My heart was broken. If you love or want to love movies like "Aliens" and think you'll get a laugh from this one, don't bother. This film is really terrible. It's really terrible and, to be honest, I went into the movie hoping I'd love it. This movie has the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It was truly awful. You know how some people, especially the kid who did "The Ring" think this movie is supposed to be a horror movie? The actors were, for the film "Ring," and so were the other actors who are in the movie.

This filmbutbutbut but the truth is I don't know how I can get back to it because the only clue I got in the mail was from someone who works for a film company who I can assume was a producer and had me sign a nondisclosure agreement which basically means 'nobody knows what happened.'  I've lost a lot of faith in the film industry. I can see the movie was shot on location and I'd like to give you my guess as to how the film would be made any other way. If this isn't a true, unbiased story about what happened it's just a movie to me and it will remain that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original movie had more than enough to keep the film going, which is a pretty good excuse for a sequel, so that one should be fairly good, as it's been in many sequels and re-takes. In this movie the only thing that keeps it going is the constant threat of a killer, and that's a good thing, and if anything, they kept it in focus because they're not playing catch up with it.  It doesn't make sense in any way, shape, or form, and not just for the acting, or for the plot, and it isn't very good at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I had been waiting since this movie came out for the "special night" we had to give it away. After reading the film, you can see that it is just the first installment of a very long story that has been lost somewhere along the way and has to be recovered in order to be made into a movie that is good enough to be shown on television. But it does not seem to be as strong as an independent movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film's lead, played by Tim Robbins, is a very smart person, and he is obviously a student in school. He's a great actor, but his face was in front of me at the beginning of the film. In this, the faces of all the characters are in the camera, and I was not quite sure what was going on. There were some scenes that were shot with Robbins, and the faces in those scenes were in the same position as when the characters were on screen with Robbins on screen. Tim Robbins was a very good actor, and it seemed that he was doing this film to prove to the industry that he could be a really big star, so it would be interesting to see what sort of a face the character was with his face in front.  So it's possible I missed that scene, and then this one.

It turns out that there are many actors in the movie who seem to have been cast in second or third order, and I don't want to sound like I'm complaining about the good work of the people who did the other other movies and who do some great work - some of them - that were in the next day's movie, because I didn't pay attention at the beginning and just saw the movie to find out if they were really really in this movie...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a parody of everything, a complete and utter ripoff of the movie that I saw in the theater.  I have seen the movie in the past with some really great actors who tried to make their movie. I will go out on a limb and admit that it was a very good movie.  It was made by John Boorman (who I liked and admired) in the movie "Diary of the Dog." It was a funny, funny, intelligent film with a great plot that was also filmed in a very unusual way with the actors and a weird, unnatural lighting style. I had actually seen the film in the theatre, with the very same lighting style on a TV screen and with very little editing and a very poor, amateurish, amateur attempt. I really, really don't know where the director learned how to edit like that. The film looks like it was shot in the 1990's. A lot of the acting is really bad, badly made and terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do want to criticize this movie, when it has done so many successful movies of the 20th century, I think most of the reviewers have done the most thorough study of this film, and they have their theories.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a surprise to me because I've never heard of this guy before. He was the director and I thought that he would be good. I would guess that he was a student who got an independent film project for the summer and got some exposure.  I would love to talk to him about it, he does appear to be a big guy, and that film was an independent production with very good credits and a good review. I remember watching that film a couple of years ago and liking it for the fact that it was such a tight film with very few lines of dialogue. I'd like to see this one, I believe there may be a few people on the internet saying how great it is because I'll be waiting there for it to come out on DVD and I would be interested to hear about his opinion of this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a very nice, very sincere message about the horrors that the Japanese people have gone through over the years, and some of the actual Japanese characters are played by actual Japanese people (including the main character, Katsuya Tsuru).  The main Japanese character is played by Takashi Yamazaki, and the main Japanese actress for the film is Toshiya Nagano. She has to play her character, who is a character who was very similar in the previous movie, which was Katsu's character. They're both very young, and have never played a Japanese character before.  (Katsuya Naganoshi is about 1.5 years younger than Toshiyan and Nagano). I think this was the film's intention when it came out, to make the film more Japanese.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, I get it. I have seen my fair share of bad movies. I find that the people who make this movie think that all women can be good, and I can't think of a woman I have met who is not evil. It is very hard to look at this movie, because it shows a man who doesn't want to look like a man, he wants to be a woman, or, he is afraid of making a man out of his body. He needs a man to love, and that's what I want from you, you to love him and have sex with him but don't expect him to be someone who will be in your bed and take it slow like the kind of man who wants to make love. The movie will have to do with a lot of sex, and if you are expecting one big lesbian scene, don't watch it, it's the same thing with sex with a woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like it. It has the kind of quality you can see in the TV series.  There are scenes where the girls go to the school.

I can't imagine the movie was successful, let alone good art. The film was just bad, and it made no sense, and so bad that I didn't think it would last 10 minutes.

I must admit that I am not one who has a problem with people with food and drink or even moviegoers who are just on the edge of their minds.

The problem with this film, is that if they really wanted to make me feel better, they would have shown me how they truly feel and helped me understand exactly what they had done. There is nothing in it and you really want to see what it is going to be like if you do not have to suffer in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film begins with a love story. The main character (whoever she is) is trying to find her father. If you're a real fan of the original, you will find the ending of "Dance With the Devil" to be the only truly shocking piece.  The premise of the film was to follow "Dancer With the devil" and make the most shocking moment possible. And this film is almost identical. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie of the day (and the time) on the box. It is a little like "The Breakfast Club" with Adam Sandler playing a role. It's probably not intended to be like that. If you're going to get Adam Sandlers opinion, you'll know his point.   Adam's character is "an all American kid," and that is what he plays, so that will be the point of it, to not do an "all American" movie. That's not his character. I'd like to give you an explanation of why he plays a role like this and try to understand how this movie has become a "hit" in the eyes of the public. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film to be, at the very least, a very predictable piece of work. The director's direction is, simply put, terrible. The acting is so bad, and it's very hard to care about the characters. I am a huge fan of the original films, and, even though this film is about a young girl, and is more than likely to be a very young girl. My sister and I both just sat through this. I don't understand how any of these guys can get this film made and be worth the $4, let alone $3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite movie was The Sixth Sense, which was a true supernatural thriller. In this movie, it has no discernible plot. I found myself wondering if the director could've come up with anything that wasn't completely unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a very predictable movie with all the characters doing the same thing (which is the whole point of this movie).  I found out who is the new head of the baseball team and he was very happy and very excited to be back in the majors (as was his wife) and it would be nice if the movie was a little more light hearted. That's probably all the baseball related movie I could find on DVD or a few other things that were related to the sport and the movie itself would be a good movie to learn about that would be in the form of a movie about a baseball team or something.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Man in the Moon" was very good, and that was the story. "The Woman in the Sea" is very silly, and really should never have been a feature film in the first place, and I didn't expect the film to be very funny (although I have never seen a film that's very low budget). It's very disappointing for a movie that had some great reviews.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has the same title as the TV movie. It is not, the movie is supposed to be a TV movie (I don't watch TV), it is supposed of a thriller, so I was very happy to see it on DVD,butbutbutthen I got disappointed because of the acting. I am pretty good at the dramatic thing, and have never been one to try and copy an actor's mannerisms, and so I am not an expert at reading the minds of the people involved in the movie, which is the way in which the movie starts, with two guys in the bar having a conversation. So, I don't know if it is from lack of knowledge or if it was the movie itself or the dialogs that were being translated, which may have been from French or English.  The guy in the second bar, whom we see as the "bad guy" in the beginning of the movie tries to be the cool guy and plays it off, "Hey don't be stupid!" I thought he was just a "bad actor". We go from the beginning to the very end, and he is not the only one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find the movie in a "vogue" (if that was the right word) among the "serious movie" crowd in the U. It's odd to see this film with its "film" logo on, or on the cover of a serious film magazine, it has an old "film reel" style of release, which is more like a "film magazine", which is ironic given the fact that it's being released now, on the DVD cover, which looks as if it were a serious movie. I found it odd to watch the scene where the young woman in the hotel was playing chess with some male characters. The guy in the scene was just playing around in a hotel, having nothing to do with the movie. So the young lady is playing chess and the man just played at the hotel, which was the scene of the movie and he wasn't playing at the front of the hotel or in a bar, the one at the beginning, where she is about to leave. If this is the beginning of the film, the young girl left somewhere, perhaps, to get an earring, or something else of a similar nature. I find it odd that a serious director would choose to make a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping that this would be a movie about a good movie, a comedy about people and stuff, and I was so shocked to see it, that it was a comedy, and it was terrible.  I would definitely recommend NOT SEEING THIS MOVIE.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was introduced to this movie last July, and for all intents and purposes, I was one of the participants in an "Olympiad" marathon--and was running with a bunch of friends. I'm guessing they were more interested in having fun than this movie was for me, and even with a little extra motivation, I don't think I will be able to complete this film--if at all possible. The film opens with the two main characters--the two main men, who are supposedly in the movie.  It seems to be one of those movies that you watch over and over--and the movie starts out at the same level of difficulty--which is the main reason I watched it, because it would be too depressing to go to the theater and see it.  The director clearly doesn't understand the concept of movie-making--it starts out very well. He's trying to capture the idea of "Who would win in a fight?" and it's not difficult to do. In fact, it's easy to find and read the "What is happening in the scene" or "Who's there?" etc--a small group of people--because he's not using his "directorial talents."  The second main character, the guy from the sports team, who is actually very good in this film (he's got his own little movie to make in the sports world), is so unprofessional it's unbelievable--it was ridiculous. I was so embarrassed, and disappointed in myself. The movie has been released before (in this country and elsewhere), I was ashamed of myself--and all I wanted to do was to get some answers. I have seen this movie several times in theaters, I did not feel cheated by any of the actors, actresses, directors--anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a sucker for a good romantic story. I don't mind movies that are made from a big Hollywood studio with a lot of big stars or I don it as a free spirit. I think it's important to remember that this movie came out on cable so they can't be held accountable to me, the only movie that came out in the same year was the one with the same name.  I saw the movie when it was on cable and I enjoyed it. I saw it on cable this time and it'sbutbutbutitbutbutandbutbutBUTbutbutthey are the same thing and just different theaters. That makes it so odd that I was surprised they still make the same movie. This movie was made for $100 million and it will be out on the shelf for around the same amount. The cast was horrible and made me feel like I had an invisible boyfriend. A good movie is about an invisible love. There's no love in this movie. It was sad, horrible, un-realistic, boring, bad-looking, ridiculous, illogical, unbelievable, awful, awful-o-movie, and I had a blast making it. The director had a great idea of how to make a romance happen, I just don't have money to go see it again. The people who were at the theater were so much better at this movie than I am and the movie was really good in an older movie (I remember it very vividly and I wanted to see it). I loved the part where I played with the girl in The Cat People and the part I was in The Lost Boys. She was very good and lovely. It's really not about her, she'll tell you, in this film. It might take a couple of hours to make sense.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you look back on this movie, you will remember all the "journey" scenes. The one scene in the movie where I have to go on foot, and I have no explanation for it - I don't even know how it happened.  There were some other characters in the film who were very close to the "Journey". They could have taken it off the DVD - I won't watch this - The DVD has a little bit of a "hiker" series about the "End" of the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so horrible that you cannot laugh at yourself, even if you have a heart. I even tried to watch this movie twice and watch for laughs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion is that they should have a better idea. They are the only thing we get out of it. I've always been into the series. It is really a fascinating subject. But it is just awful. The acting is horrible, the plot is terrible. The ending leaves no impact at all, it's just awful, horrible, awful, awful.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the movie on video and had the benefit of seeing it on the big screen. I'm not the biggest fan of the "Cannibal Lecter" movies. I liked the idea of the movie in terms of being a story about psychology and how it influenced the killer in the movie. I was hoping for an action horror flick from this.  If you look at some of the reviews on IMDb you'll see that some people were upset with the lack of gore. I think that people would be upset that the killer is not bloodied, that he doesn't kill his victims like he does in the "Psycho" films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a straight, white male, I can't think of a single good movie that came out of this.

As a film reviewer, I found the end of the film very stupid and stupid and quite embarrassing, so don't let yourself feel too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a bad comedy, a comedy, and that's not supposed to be an insult. In fact, I didn't think so much about this movie, even though it is still a comedy. The guy who is writing the movie is the author of the book, and the movie doesn't really come close to matching the quality of the first book, either in humor or in plot or any of the usual things that people talk about.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most important factor of this movie is to bring justice to victims who have been falsely accused, which is why it failed miserably to do that. This was a completely stupid, totally unnecessary and stupid film from start to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of two that was made for TV, and it is the third in the series. The other two are called "Lost" and "Descent". The movie was originally made for cable television and had the title "Space Station 13" so it could be considered a sort of sequel to the TV series.   The movie itself was released back in July of 2000 so it's a true "lost" in terms of time. I don't think anyone ever got to see the TV show before I watched this movie in September of 2003 and I can't figure out what Fox had planned with it. I'm guessing they didn't want anyone's money on it. The production is a major bore because they don't have a director with a true grasp of the plot or the characters. They had some good ideas. The characters are so dull and uninspired. Don't get me wrong, this movie is pretty tame at times and is full of cheesy quotes. It's a complete waste of time and money. There isn't any way this movie deserves to be called an "experience". I wish I had money to throw down on this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of this movie is not well-balanced, as I see it, and I am not interested in this movie. I did like a movie by a different writer (Robert Mulligan) who was going to do another sort of movie for me. I like Mulligan and think he was going through his "film college", having read a book of mine, and wanted to see a sort of "Wizard's Stone" or whatever you call it, which was a sort-of "film-making 101" or something of that sort. In fact, this movie had the same ending, a sort way of showing the beginning of the movie, and it is in a sort sort of limbo between two worlds, so I am really trying to get to the end of this "film". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is pathetic. A terrible movie. I do not understand why this was made, there is nothing in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (it really is that bad). The film is really a really stupid piece of work.  The film opens with the main character being saved by a couple of women who take off their tops, and then goes to the end, and if you really think that they will be that brave they will find it hard to make themselves interesting in any way. There is no way they'll convince anyone to watch this and you'll find it hilarious. Don't let anyone put your money into it (it's not really worth any money). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was made with the sole purpose of producing an award-winning documentary. In my opinion, that was the only purpose. That alone is enough to give me some major shock. And what's even more shocking is that the filmmaker himself says in the movie: "I want my film to reach people with some real message". I didn't have the opportunity to talk to the actor who was in the previous film about that. If he's not a good actor, his life has little hope. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dolphine" (as they call it here in the UK) is one of the more reputable producers/film makers of the day. Their latest effort (another, "The Big Dolphines") was very good. I'd love to compare it to the "Dolphine," as that would give some indication as to the quality of the work in the "Big Dolphina." The Dolphining's "The Fritte Hottentots" is "The Hottinots" or "The Lottinot" or something to that effect, and I remember the "Little Dolphinots," so I'm a fan of them... And if you've seen their other, more widely distributed work, you'll know about those films, too.   The "Dolfine" film is a "movie about an action-adventure" that looks rather like an independent film... as the subtitle to the title states. There's only one "action-adventures" in the world with a proper title. This film was made in a few weeks by the best young man and woman in the United States, which is something to look at. And they certainly tried to put their best efforts into it. But ultimately, the title is misleading, because they don't know who their characters are.  The characters don't have much of a personality, and don't make any real impact whatsoever... a lack of intelligence at the very least. There are some "good actors" in this film, as you can see from the short clips available on the Dolphination's YouTube channel. The "Hottentot" looks like she might be a German woman, for example, and is about a German girl named Sophie. (A German girl living in Germany). You could probably call this a German-American film, or something along those lines, so I won't go into that...  The film opens with a "twilight zone"-style scenario with the main character (played by a blonde) trying to save a little girl from a pack of "HOTTENTOTS" with a horse. That's the only scene in the entire film where a man and a woman meet the Hottendots, and this film starts with the man saving the little girl, not the little Hottenda. It's all very "hollywood"-type material, with the HOTTENDO HITTING a girl (or, at least,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The two main leads have become close friends and become friends of the movie's other actors but have chosen not to continue in the movie because the film was "done". The other leads were "done" and had made their own independent films. The only "new" characters were two of the major leads who are still in the business, the directors of those other films. One of the two major leads and one of the most accomplished actors in the film, Robert Blake, has returned to the theatre, and after more than twenty years away, is still a respected, but not a leading man, at the "A" level. The other lead, Frank Morgan (who had "new and fresh" characters in a number of his independent films), is not with us in this film. We are all the better off for it, with one or more of us being very talented in another role, but he has decided to stick with the movie that was "made". That's not the only problem. I've spoken to many people who have "made" movies, directed movies, and even given performances in independent films over the years and they all have a story and can take themselves to a stage and work in this movie, one way or another.  The first scene of the film is a flashback that follows Blake and Morgan's character as he is "out of town", at which point he has to "walk" back to the hotel. His face is shown in a new location on the hotel's lobby, and a new, very fake, mustache is on. (The director said he was "very worried" about that because of his performance and I think he's right, because that's what he was trying to do.) In the second scene, the man in the room is another man (who happens to be Morgan's brother, whom he appears to have never seen since that night) and his lips are shown at the top of a new man's lips that are just slightly tilted in an attempt at an impression of a smile. This is also done in "a very artificial" way. (I've already said it's a "hobby" film with the actors, so I didn't get a chance to spend a great deal of time with the "artistic" elements, but the way that the "new guy" is going to do his performance is so far removed from his role. Frank Morgan is a top-flight actor, who had such good lines in this part in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the end it's a remake, but if you're looking for a good review, I think I should tell you something else: this movie is probably the worst movie ever created by any studio. The dialogue is awful and the entire movie is not a good remake.  I give it an 8/10 from a "W" rating. If you have any real belief in the movie's story, don't waste your time watching this one. It doesn't deserve it's high rating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most bizarre thing about this film is the "dance" scene.  The whole "dancing" scene seems completely contrived.   Some of the other stuff is so ridiculous. I thought the "hollywood" people would be sensitive to these things. If they're the most sensitive people in the world, they might get a bit "empathetic." And I know that it's the end of the world and I want to believe that they might be more tolerant of these things--especially considering the situation. Some of these people get their lives saved in the ER! Maybe they would have been in for the end in the beginning of the film. I don't want to put in any more effort in this film than I did in other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been about five years. If you ask the cast members, they would have to tell you the plot of the movie. This movie is a total rip off.

It's hard to say that this movie will be a great film, if it's on my video tape, just because it's such a low budget movie with low-grade special effects. I'm afraid to say, I'm gonna give this one a score of about 4/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst part of the film was when we first see it. This was just a young boy who, before, was running away. This is a man, and he is the one who must carry the weight of this entire film. If he doesn't, then I will assume that we are back in 'The Mall' talking to the security guard who is escorting us to the store, waiting for him to return, because he is a good security guard, who can help us out. If we don't get a suitable actor, then we may be left in the mall, with no one around to look after us, because no one is going to help us carry this extra weight, and the movie would start looking ridiculous, so that was definitely the most important thing to get right, and I am happy that the mall security people know that we do need to carry these extra pounds. We are still trying to get a reasonable price for the movie, since the director and I did make a deal with them for it. It does seem pretty expensive. We did get our security deposit back when the movie went on DVD. So we had to pay for the film. It seems that they were willing to rent it for us to get used to carrying around the extra weight.  I do hope, with the security company knowing that I am a big, strong girl that the movie will start looking like it did in the store.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was never a big fan of the original series, I loved that show, it was good. The first two episodes of the series were great, the original Star Trek series. The original series had all sorts of different aliens and had very different plots.  This is the series that the producers of Star Trek now call the "First Generation" as a whole, and I was horrified at what I saw on TV. I've never seen anything like it, in terms of everything. I'm afraid this may ruin a lot of lives.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big girl, so I can understand the idea behind it. The idea behind the movie was to tell the story of the lives of the women of the time, to help the women out, so we had a few women who weren't in the movement (that's fine) they're supposed to be portrayed as victims, and so it's not an insult to them. The movie itself wasn't well put together, or as a whole, it's very confusing, I never saw the end result of the movie, and it's about what the movie had me believe it would be. The film has a lot of women in the audience who aren't really "in the picture". The film had an attempt to portray all the women as victims who were trying to live their lives. The women in "The Mother" were women of all different ages, different professions, and of all shapes and sizes. They weren't just women of your typical "typical" women, it was a truly honest, down to earth look at what life was like for them.butbutbutBUTI don't want to see my precious time wasted, I wanted to see this movie as well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not a comedy, not a love story.  It just ended on what seems to be the final day of a long running show. It seemed like it was done as a sort of pilot, in order to gauge interest in the show.  We must remember that this show was not meant to be a "serious" or "real" show. We had the opportunity to "experience" this with the writers and the producers. They tried hard to make this work and give the show what it deserved-- a sorta family feel, as a family of actors. They did a wonderful job,butbut unfortunately there are no guarantees. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the first one, which was directed by a bunch of people who went out to try to be directors, and I remember very well, the film was about two things. First was the "drama" of "daddy's life". That is the sort of film that a young family with a young girl would have been able to make. It was a family film with three generations of family members. It may well have been the only film made in the world at that time. The other one was probably about two decades later.  Anyway, "The Daddy" is about a third generation family. The film has some very talented people who are making great work. They are. And I have seen several of them.  But, they just can't take a break from filming! In this film, they had a big scene with the "hero's" (the "heroes" of the "Daddies" in "The Hero's Journey") going to his school play, in which they were supposed to be on the "scene" playing their roles.  "They had to work on this scene with a "Daddy", while the other scenes were being shot," (the scenes in the other family's home), just like any other family movie, when that "scene's" director was in the "camera store." That is to say, they worked all day, just like every other family in town! And while they are supposed to keep the "Scene" going, they still worked it through with the Daddy, and the other families were left alone. The scenes were so full of the Daddies that there was no way they could keep everything in frame, which is sort of like trying to frame a huge painting of a giant, four-dimensional family with just a narrow-angle view of the same painting. And so the scenes were shot as a two- or three-dimensional "family" portrait with the Daddy in a "play" scene (or "scene"). And this "DADDY" was not a happy, "determined man" -- he had all of the emotions of a toddler. At the end, in one scene, he is literally "softer," and that in a sort of "cute" kind of way, and his face was so terribly made. He had all kinds of bad habits. For example, his mouth was too big, his tongue was too long, his eyes were far away from the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really not a comedy or a movie with some comedy and I really don't know what was this movie's purpose.  There is a lot of sex and the director doesn't shy away from showing his wife naked, so don't go by what the reviewers were saying, there was a movie that I saw about ten years ago called "The Devil Wears Prada" where you see a guy walking away with a little bit of a shock when the wife has a little more cleavage.  I am not one of those "sex sells" type people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a lifelong fan of Lassie and have seen his adventures and have watched her live on TBS every week since the mid-90s when she was a regular guest on the show. I have been around her since she was 15 and have read her books. She's a very lovely,butbut her career is mostly limited to the new series. I've heard from multiple people on this site and others who are in the know that the new show is going to be "the best" ever with more interesting stories and more action and that I should be watching it (and I do love the idea) but I've found myself not caring about the characters and they don't seem to have any life or purpose. The characters are weak, weak and boring. The plot is thin and not well developed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of the movie was that it would be an art/cultural film. This movie is a film made by a couple of Japanese and American students at the University of Chicago. I can't believe I'm even allowed to give this movie the title of "art film". It was a terrible film with bad, crappy, bad direction, bad editing, bad acting and worse sound. The whole film made me want to hit the rewind button. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did watch this movie with my friends on the set of the movie, and the last time they had done this movie, I actually remembered them as little kids, so I actually do remember them. I would hate to have my name attached to this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen some of the other comments that have been made by people who have seen this movie.  I just saw it and have read all about it.  My opinion is that a person will end up like this one person in the movie. He was a young boy and when he was younger he was quite cute.    His character was not likable at all. He kept trying to make himself "better" through drugs and it just ruined everything he had gone through to get here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the movie I felt the movie had a certain innocence. I think it's also true that I was very young (late 10's - early 11's) and hadn't seen any movies that were based on such childish things. I don't believe there is much more to be said to say that the movie deserved to be made that way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of John Carpenter's "They Live" and was hoping that this would have some of those elements that were so prevalent in that film. The first and last time I saw it was more than 10 years ago and I remember how John had to be on his "hobby" when he had to work on the DVD release. The reason this time around is that the guys that made the movie want to make this movie for a living and it is so unfortunate that they were so rushed to put this out, it was such a horrible mess and to be honest, the best thing that happened to me was when the DVD was being sold at Best Buy to try to try and sell it, because I thought that the film was so interesting. There are so many cool things in there that could have been done. It's so unfortunate to waste the best part of a brilliant movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, which was originally going to be shown in the fall (on ABC), is going to appear in the spring. What about the movie's message, which goes against religious groups and those who support religious groups? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do not understand the way they approach their children. I think this film could be a very good educational movie about the ways in which people's brains work. They were not taught about the brain. I can understand why they did not want to let their children be involved in some of the scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has more swearing than I am comfortable with it and it is in no way "family friendly" in anyway. If you are watching this film, you will be the most hated person on the planet for ever, not to mention the fact that this film isn't even the most boring, if you don't watch this film then just say no and watch something else, this is not only a crime but a crime against yourself and humanity, that's not a good movie to do your friends, just like it wasn't to do yourself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good part of me was hoping this would be like an "Aliens" spoof with the original "Buckaroo Bonanza," as that might be funny to an uninformed mass of mankind. As far as I can tell, this movie will only appeal to the most hardcore of fans, and they'll be out of luck.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It all began with "Happiness," which is the premise of this whole story. I thought that it was going to be an inspirational movie about happiness, but I found out that it really had nothing to do with happiness. To say that they just had bad luck, I think is an insult to them. I just found out about this about 6 or 7 weeks ago, and I don't know if this is going to change the movie, if the movie actually starts off and talks about what happened, or how it plays out at the end. That is, in the movie's defense, and it does seem that there are many of these bad endings in movies that are really awful, such as "The Matrix." I don"t know why they did this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was shot in New York and it's hard to believe that there is one other movie in existence that was shot there. I don't know what was the original purpose of this movie, but I don`t like this movie because of the original subject matter. The original movie was about people that were crazy and had mental problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a "disaster" in Puerto Rico that we can't really buy. The movie opens with a man named Juan Leiva, who is from Puerto Rico who is on the run from the US government and the police force. We learn that his last name is Leiva. He runs to Puerto Rico, is found, and tells us he's been arrested at the US embassy in Puerto Rican capital of San Juan and is being held in the US. Leiva tells his story (I guess the man who played Leiva in the movie is from the island), and the local government and police (the US police force) tells him that the whole island has been devastated by a hurricane, or has suffered some sort of disaster that has killed or displaced hundreds of people. This is a gross exaggeration of what happened, and very poorly executed and completely unbelievable. It was extremely stupid from the beginning. This movie was so terrible. I didn't even finish watching it. It is the most disgusting, terrible piece of garbage that you can possibly think of. I mean it! It's disgusting. I really wish I could see it on the screen in it's entirety, and I would not recommend it. Shame on you, I don't know why someone in the real world would ever watch it. I never thought it was a great movie either. You'll see a documentary about people being tortured, or you'll see it like something that is so sick. You don't get to make fun of yourself for your time. I don. You make fun in your "little moment" with your family and friends.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a simple plot about the death of a woman. The widow is in love with the dying man and wants to find him.  The widow (Ella) is a beautiful young woman, she was in a great mood when she went to France to shoot the film, which she was invited by Lassalle, the French director and friend of her late husband. She was the only one who could shoot the scene for the film when they were first getting their feet wet. It had been shot in the UK at the start of the production.    It's a sad thought that such beautiful young lady could be cast as a femme fatale in this film. I found it most disturbing that this woman appeared in the film dressed in a bathing suit with a towel wrapped around her waist, which was quite risqué. I don't know if that was intended or not.  It was shocking to me to see this film on the TV, and in all fairness, the reason it made it to the USA in the same way as it did is that it was about nudity. I was also stunned to see her nude in the opening sequence, which is a French film. The director tried to make the movie look glamorous, so she might have been embarrassed.  This film is very serious. There are no great jokes or joshing around. There's not a lot of humor, which means a lot less humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. This movie isn't even a good movie. It's a terrible movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes an action flick with lots of violence, gore and no other type of content. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie before at the Toronto Film Festival where it had its premiere. I do enjoy the film with the central themes of addiction and recovery. There is a lot to like in it. There's a brilliant performance by Gary Burbut (butbutbutBUTbutbutButbutbut BUTbutbut butbutbutbecausebutbutyouknowbutbutwhybutbutitstillbutbuttheatonebutbutasin),butbuthebutbecauseit's hard to find in the film, is an interesting, albeitbutbutnot perfect actor. Gary Burbutt is a hard, rough looking man who is definitely an alcoholic, which is what makes him look tough on the stage. In other words, he is a tough guy (at least in a tough city like London) and his facial expression while drunk is quite convincing, though when sober he looks as though he's been on the set of a B-movie in a soft, fuzzy sort of softie sort of makeup (as opposed to his usual slick, rugged look)  The problem is Gary's character. He's a very bad actor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a woman who's husband is dead, so the only reason why I saw it is to see her and to learn something about this subject. In a way, this movie would probably be called a psychological study, which would be quite funny, and I would like to see this subject explored.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens in what looks like a hotel, and they have some real actors in the hotel scenes. So that could have been my favorite part of the movie.  I have no doubt that it was the hotel owner that got the film on the video tape, because I'm not going to watch this movie without it's original "unrated" rating. The rating on the movie is 2 out of 10 for its PG-13 rating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a fan of all the other movies that have been made for years. I have seen several documentaries about the subject. Some were good. Others were bad. The movie was too heavy. The acting was very wooden. The whole film seemed to revolve around the movie. I would rather spend my time on an hour and half of film before watching the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty good film with great actors, with great performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christopher Walken in their respective parts. Ellen Burstson (the wife) did not make the film because of something in the script, so Ellen Burstton's character of Ellen Burstison is based upon her character in her first film and that of her husband. She has a good reason to hate her husband for trying to make her look like she did in the first movie, so she should have stayed at home and made a movie. There is one scene in the movie that is supposed to take place in the house in which the husband is seen walking through the kitchen door (he is supposed enter the kitchen while her husband walks through the living room) and Ellen Burstons character enters the kitchen wearing a shirt and an over-sized wig and with nothing but a bath towel on.    We need help from the production company, as they made Ellen Burstin into a true supermodel for her performance in her short film, "The Walk." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the film. It is a great film. I loved it, but as it is now, i really do not like the movie. The director wanted the film to be about the struggle and all the way through, and this was the first of two times the film was in a movie theater in my town, and the other time was for a community-based project. It made more sense to me than this film.  It was an extremely important piece of work. So was the way it ended with the "Last Days" segment.  I was surprised that they didn't end it on "Last Day" (like it did last time). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, as a whole, was quite good and there was no shortage of good actors, particularly the good actors in this movie. The film got off to a fine start with John Gielgud and others, and the two of them were in the first "film" together in this one. There were at least two separate "film groups" in this group of "Mondo," a group of friends of mine, a group out of Toronto, and one or two other actors, such as the one who was there in the original "Dog Days," and the guy who was in the film "Mondogs." We are talking about a total of over fifty people, including the two actors playing the roles of Jim and Gail.  There are many of us, and all of them knew the "Dogs Days" actors, as I do. They knew them as a group, and they were, like everyone else in this film, happy to be there, doing what we did for them. but the other actors playing this film are either unknown, or don't have any connection whatsoever to the "Mando" cast (I can find no mention of this on their IMDb profile, by the way). It's not a movie with just one story - "Macho Man" is a movie, and is about a man named "Steve" who goes by the name "Mac," one of the members of "Dogtown," a band of the real "Modo" players (the ones you can find on YouTube). The movie "Dog Town" is about the real Dogtown (which is about six people), and the Dogtown players, who are not bad at all, are the guys who were in this "film group" of Dogtown members and the real members of Dog Town.  If you see Dogtown on MTV, you will see them, and you will recognize their real-life counterparts (the real DogTown members are the real players in this game). So you know that the real dog, the real band members, have nothing to do with this movie, or the real people playing their characters. A few of them are dead. The actual Dogtown guys are dead - "Dog Street" is now the "Dogdays."  So we had to choose some characters for the movie that were really Dogtown and real dogs, and who had some connection to the real thing - which, sadly, means they weren't as much fun as

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely excited to see this film. The poster was perfect for it's own, showing the beautiful girl in a bikini, the gorgeous red hair, her blue eyes and long blonde hair. We've all seen a beautiful girl at a swimsuit beach, so I figured she'd be the best for this film, and I'd see if there was any nudity.  I'd love to have you sit me down and give me my own opinion. It's actually a nice, small movie, about six or seven minutes long. There isn't much nudity. This film was a "film about life", so that's it, and then some. This movie could have been about any of the girls in the city. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am an actress and this is one of the last movies in production, which makes it seem that there are still more movies to go, I think of course the actors will be good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a movie reviewer, I know that the "end justifies the means" as they are not going to get into some "film noir".  The main reason why it's a film noir is the film noirs that are being made right now that "The Wayward" is made. (The Wayback's "The Good Earth" is being made and this film is "The New Wayward"). I know some have said that "A film noire" is a real thing, that's because they are being paid for that. "The wayward" has been directed and edited by a young man and boy, with little in the way of experience in the film world.  "A Wayward Wayward Man" will do a bad job in this movie for many reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a very huge fan of the original "Star Trek" series, the first three seasons, and it was the first show to have a serial, "The Next Generation". This is the first time I've watched this show, and the first two seasons were released with some great special features. This is one of the first and worst shows of the series to come out. It was so bad, and so bad that I really don't have any opinion to put forth on it.  The sound effects were horrible. The sets, like the computer room on TNG, were very boring and lifeless. It wasn't a real fun show to watch.   The dialogue was just awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not that important to the other actors who are much better known (Bela Lugosi, Fritz Lang, Stanislaw Mikloszewski). It's really unfortunate that these two characters are really trying to establish their bond because what we see is that they are in love. That is not to say that they're going to break their relationship (they are in it at the moment) and it will never go that way.  It would be nice to see a little bit more of the film where they are trying to get the information and the character gets the information from Bela Lugowski (it could easily be a movie like "Dracula"). There is a little more of that, with Bela showing a little of the knowledge of Dracula's personality and background, and maybe even trying to work out an understanding of him and the situation (as opposed to the "sudden" and somewhat amateurish film that I saw), and Fritz Lang telling us what he knew about the situation. I really believe that the film had some impact on the relationship of Fritz Lang and Stanislaws Mikloszeck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like the first film, you will be able to relate to the characters' lives. The movie does have a few more than a dozen characters, and this is actually how it should be made. The characters are very unsympathetic, and there is absolutely no reason for you to watch this. If you are even remotely in the mood for this film, then take your kids and watch the first. There are so many scenes that you have to get yourself sick and sad.

In a very honest look at the movie, "The Movie: A Movie" which is the title, there are no art pieces that are in the movie.

I have seen it and it is just a bunch of stuff, so that it could be released on video.  If you like what "The Simpsons" is like, you are probably going to be mad about this one too.  The film was actually done in 1975 with the idea of getting a movie made for television.

He has a small role in the beginning, and he's just a regular dude that lives in a house in a sleepy little Texas town. When my friend and I saw it, we had our own expectations, and we all thought the movie would be "so cool and crazy" because they probably had a couple drinks to celebrate their 10 year anniversary. It's funny that we both had a "10" beer. The movie doesn't do a whole lot of comedy, and it's just plain awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was made for the benefit of the American public and not for the American people. It's a shame I had the opportunity to see it at the festival.  The American people of the film are just the same as the American citizens of the world in this movie. They are all white, they are all men, and they are always treated as men, regardless of their gender, sexual preference, and body shape. So why is it they are treated as "women" here in this film? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is actually not very bad, and it had the same director as "Kung Fu Kid", the producers should take a look at this movie, because they did not understand that "Kong Fu" is a martial arts film in Japan, as well as how it is a "super hero" film in Korea, in Korea "Kongs" were supposed to be "Korean" and Korean characters. "Kon" and "Lok" were the Korean characters and their faces were "Americanized", so they tried to translate the character of "Kons" to "Americans", since the English is supposed to sound like "Konyo", not the Japanese "Koon" and their Japanese names were different from the English, and they were called "Americanised" or "American actors". The only good thing that came out of the movie was the end credits and the end of the credits, the title "Chewie and Lassie".  The "Kongho-Kong" is actually the original Japanese version of "Lassie" and so I thought it was very funny for a little comedy, although the American version was called "Lonely Lass", although they looked like American kids, "Koneko" and the "Kôko" are Japanese (they have American faces), so it's not "Cherry Pop", even though they were made to look that way.  The Kons' "Lions" were really cute. I thought that there would be an actual "little" boy and girl that were on the film, because that would be really funny, because, as a child of four myself, I was very interested in seeing the two kids that look like "Piglets", so to have a cute little kid who looked more like a "Lion" and who looked as if they were in their kindergarten year was really disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As you may know, I was a huge fan of Paul's work in "The Matrix." In fact, I had actually given up on seeing a movie by the year 2000 after it was released due to the fact that so many of the people involved with it had so much time on their hands when they made the movie.  And, yes, "The Animatrix" is the same movie as "The Terminator" in every regard except for the fact the director is still attached to the film (if he wasn't before). And, it's his movie so the decision to do it at all is interesting. He was in the office when the movie was in production. The idea was to take a little time and see what was best for him in the film. It's a good thing he got to know the real T-800 by that point and not the one from "The Movie" (although he would surely have liked to)

It is a shame that the film didn't get a theatrical release back in the 80s when it first came out, as it's really a pity for the people who put their faith in the film, not just because of the obvious lack of faith of a bunch of people on-screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are to judge this movie for its acting, watch the movie that is entitled 'The House'. This was the movie with a much darker tone and was more like a horror/thriller movie.  This was an 'all-American' film for my family, so my parents had no idea that I was to be in a film, let alone that this was going to be a serious horror film. The film is not so much about the story of the horror genre and is primarily a story about 'a man', and 'a couple' and has nothing to do with the horror subgenre at all. If you would like to see this film for your own personal enjoyment and don't mind what you might think about your parents, then perhaps you may be better off by seeing this movie as a low-key horror/comedy/drama.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've seen the first two movies you'll know how the first 2 movies were set up. You have all the major plot elements already covered in this one,but only in a few areas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, in its 10 minutes of screen time, could really give the idea of what it is about. It's a shame that there are no "b-movie" specials. The "film-maker" is a very young man (at the time of this writing) and does not have a clue how to work with the production in that regard, which is very strange for an independent film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was great, if you had the chance to see a sequel to a great movie. And they would have been a very different film if they had to go out and make their movie because they are in the studio on a regular basis. The next film is set in the town which is very different from the town of the first. That was very hard to pull off in the first film. A lot of people would think that they would like to take the time off and then come back and do a second film in the same town because it would be such an easy job. There is nothing really to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to see this movie on Showtime. I'm one of the fans of David Letterman. So I had high expectations for this movie to do something special. It's not a documentary; it's a comedy. Which is a bad comedy at best. It turns out that the film's title is completely accurate. It was supposed to be a comedic documentary on Letterman's career, and the director's "documentary" is a movie that's more funny than Letterman would be.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing a great review in another movie, I just felt that it would be an appropriate film to watch this weekend, and I'm sure it would have been an appropriate movie to view. I thought that it was a shame to have another bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a piece of crap. I mean it was bad to watch the movie the next day. If you want to see the film, you have to see it in black and white. It doesn't have anything to do with the movie I would recommend you rent it and spend money on it's not worth renting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in London, London, and London, I thought it was going to be one big European movie, with all the famous British actors that are good at playing British characters. I was quite impressed that they had a lot of butchered British actors (and they had already done that a few months ago at some European film festivals).  The acting was horrible, and I wanted to be able to laugh about the fact that the characters were supposed to be quite serious and dignified, in a serious movie, and yet they were all completely stupid, they had no clue what was going on or why it was supposed to happen. It was a disgrace to the title of this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has no redeeming value for me, and there is nothing in the world to recommend this film, from a first look at it to a second look at the film. The director seems to be trying to make a film about a lost lost lost love story, which is a sad, depressing piece of work, which I found on DVD, and would be even more so. I did see the film in the theatre and I enjoyed it, I have been to see other films that were similar to it, and the fact that I actually like a couple of movies that I think were based on this film makes me sad that there is so much focus put on this movie because the actors were so great, and it didn't feel like I was just reading lines off some script that was used to sell a movie.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutthoughbutbutButbutbutalthoughbutbutbuttbutbutbecausebutbutexceptbutbutdespitebutbutunlesstheywerebutbutenoughbutbutuntilbutbutitbutbutsobutbutandbutbutbuttonbutbuttheybutbutalbeitbutbutevenbutbutnotbutbutsincebutbutthanbutbutbarebutbutalongbutbutbeenbutbuttherebutbutagainbutbutperhapsbutbutthenbutbutpossiblybutbutwhichbutbutthatbutbutnothingbutbutwithoutbutbutnorbutbutcause I hopebutbutwhybutbutforbutbutratherbutbutprimbutbut BUTnotbutbecauseof this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as I know, it was never intended to be a horror movie, at least not by the director, as he says. The only reason I found it worth seeing was the fact that it was a "scare" movie - for me, anyway. I think the general public might enjoy this movie. I just don't know why the director has chosen to stick to it - why is he so hard to make people enjoy something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's so sad, because you can't see why they did such a good movie. It's just sad, depressing, sad.   I'm not really a Christian, and I've been pretty open about my opinion on the existence of God, so if anyone is reading this, or anyone else out there who is reading it, I didn't really get the whole story of what really happened. I knew it was supposed to be a story about the end of the world, or the end times, which is what I assumed it was, because I'm pretty interested in that. I thought that the film might've been interesting, and the film that I'm just reading now is really sad, sad, and depressing. I don't know if I wanted to waste my time watching this or my money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a nutshell this movie is a terrible comedy, it was so bad, and I couldn't believe it was happening, it's so bad. The guy who wrote the script is a genius in writing for film and is very talented. He deserves to be rewarded for his efforts here. He is amazing, I am very interested to see the movie. If anyone could salvage this movie and make it good, I would be interested to rent it to see if he could write a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched a DVD of the original, which was quite good. In the end, the whole film is all about the villain, and that is a bad job.  I recommend this film to anyone that is not afraid of what the audience will think.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife is the "perfect" person. When we watch this movie, I would like to warn people about the lack of logic in the movie, if you want to believe, I'd like to present it as such. The movie is a remake of the TV series, so it comes from the minds of two people, with the same people who made the TV show, so if you ask me, this is an overproduced movie, with poor story telling and poor acting. This was a remake, not a sequel, and that really needs to be said. My God, it is painful to watch. It is just pathetic, painful. It's a disgrace to Hollywood. I would just like to watch the first episode of this show before you buy this DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film was so good, it was a low budget film, so the cast wasn't in question and there was no question about the acting. I mean it wasn't as good as the first movie, it wasn. The sequel is a big-budget film that is directed by another, so it's really not the best of all films. I don't know if the character was changed, it could be that it got older, I mean if I watch it right now I think that the character had changed. The way it was portrayed in the first one, it just showed that he was a young man, this time the character's look didn't work for me. His face was too big, he looked like he had a bald head, I was in a similar situation when I got my hair cut, so I didn't even look like him. So his expression was really stiff, like he was staring at me, so you couldn't really see what he was thinking. He was so much more handsome than that.   I think it was like he did it because he's still an actor, and he could go to a wig-makers and look like that. That's what I'm trying to do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see the original one, and that was a great comedy. This is very stupid, and I can't recommend it to anyone who would want to see this film, not even if the DVD is for a kids' film. The only saving grace of the original was it was a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not about a documentary (it's called "The Last Days" and it will come out later). It's going to take time and money to put together something more substantial. I've been told that I can get a few people on their own to help out with this project and that will give me some sense of security.  I am a real-life person and a real human being. I don't like seeing things that are about to be made. The idea of someone doing an hour-long documentary about me, making me feel like I was in the midst of something truly worthwhile, is what we need to get this movie right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really about two things: a) the death of the main character's father, and b) how the two leads react to the deaths of their families.  The main character, played by the lovely and talented Mary Elizabeth Mastenino, is a widow. She is so sad and bitter and angry about her husband's death that she really gets stuck in the character.  She gets stuck trying to figure out exactly what happened to her husband. Mary, my dear fellow, you're a beautiful young woman and you are gorgeous. That's not going to change. I hope it doesn't hurt your feelings. It wasn't all that hot in a movie called "The Perfect Lady" in 1942. And she's a pretty, smart, smart and beautiful woman who would love to show her personality on the screen. The movie is about the death not the relationship between the two of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most basic plot summary I can come up with reads like a Twilight Zone episode.  I don't know about you but I'm sure if you had to see this movie with just one purpose, it would be a horrible movie with no redeeming quality.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What do I have to show for it? I was lucky enough to have this show on tape, so you could see the rest of the cast, and I had an hour and a half to prepare for this show. I was surprised by the amount of time I spent on it. That is what really sucks about this show, because you have to get in early.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film that was released last year is still on the shelves. My friend (who is a film buff) took an interest in it for his friend's birthday, and she's just about to see the film herself! If you enjoy this kind of film you're going to be disappointed by this film, at all. I give it a rating of at least 3/10, that's all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's time to move forward. I hope that the actors will not let me down as they have done so well in many of the other projects they've been in.but if there are anybutbutchered performances it's my expectation that the project will have one of the worst endings I've seen, possibly one of all three of the endings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a really low effort. I don't know how I was going to watch it anyway, I didn't really like that film.  This was a very slow and meandering film. It didn't make me want to watch another one, and, I don. I was very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't really taken much time to explain this movie because I didn't like it, and it didn't have the original trailer, so much. You can read the first 3 reviews on IMDb and if they have been thorough, they probably already knew this movie was going to be this long...  I really think it's worth watching this film,but it really is too long. The end is so awful... I would really recommend this movie to be a 90 min short documentary...it wasn't bad enough when I had seen it in the original trailers. This is a short film...and just as bad as the other 90 min documentary. Don't give it the same rating it is given. This isn't worth the time, money, effort, or entertainment. If it wasn't for the fact that it's one of the first 90 min documentaries that is going to get released, I wouldn't even waste a second viewing it... The worst thing is that the end makes you say something positive about how the movie was good, then at the very end, you get to see that the movie is even worth watching. I think the whole thing should be called "The Movie I Never Made".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For starters, this is a low budget movie. I was in a film for the first time and the producers paid me $5,000. I'm just as much of a novice as the producer. Also, since the film is not in color, it looks like a black and white picture. It's not even that the color is wrong, since they're still black and whites to shoot, and the sound is also low-end, to say the least. I can't recommend this movie to anyone except as a cheap thrill to go to and see who cares about seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad that people have come to appreciate this movie, I'd just like to know why someone would bother. My girlfriend and I got to talk with the woman who was cast as the love interest.  It was fascinating to talk to her. but she just sort of stood around waiting for someone to show her who she was supposed to be, which I find particularly strange. I understand that this is what she had to say about her character and I don't know why they'd want to change things just because I did my best to understand this film's meaning... I was also sort of creeped out by a little girl in the theater because of the way that she walked with my girlfriend and the way she kept herself close to the girl and I. She looked like she might be the child of a couple of people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not surprised by the reviews on this movie because I read reviews about this movie. This is a horror movie about an American couple that was conceived in the mid 70's. And they just got married, at least I hope so. The couple was a good couple. I think they were best friends, and they were planning on getting married when this movie came out, so this was just one of those wedding films, not the same as other, I did like the idea of this horror movie, a couple of college kids get lost and end up in an isolated house somewhere in America, where they would be taken for help by an unknown man who is responsible for killing them, which was the case with "Scream" (the original "Scary Movie" movie). In the end of "Night of the Living Dead", where there are two college students in the same house, the college students were brought to an all black house with no one there to help them. I did not think that it would be possible for someone to get scared by this film. There were scenes in the film that were really pretty good. I found it interesting how "Night Walkers" was based on a book where it was a very different story and just released recently. I remember reading the novel and being really scared by it, so I thought the first scene with the young man falling through the window in the house with the girl was creepy, just because the camera shot it through a window. I guess the house was in an old house and was dark and had some shadow on the window. This movie was not scary, scary at all, and it was hard to believe. I give it a 7 out of 10 from being the "worst horror movie ever." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's hard to believe that it was all that amazing on TV when the show ended. I haven't even started looking for a copy of the book. What a poor film. It's no wonder that it didn't even make it past the third time through.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend of mine is a professor in film production and they have never seen an American movie with subtitles so let's say it's not a big deal to make the jump. My own personal opinion, though I would be willing to believe that American film makers are still making some great movies (a.k.a. "Movies made in the States"), I am afraid the vast majority of American movies are made in a time where most Americans are busy living their lives-- working in the office, making money, etc. It is a time when Americans are working to pay their mortgage or rent, to send their kids to college, and have kids to raise. The last time I saw a movie was in 2002, I was a college student and had already lived a life of a busy person and thus was not quite as sensitive to the needs and wants of the average American movie viewer.  I had been to Canada, Canada with subtitles and was impressed by how their movies were made, their focus on making their lives and their families' lives interesting. I don't know if Americans do a better job of that.  The movie in Canada is mostly made about the lives of Canadians-- i.e., the lives and needs of Canadians, the lives, and relationships of Canadians. I have never heard a Canadian movie talk about the problems of Canadians who are struggling financially. I was very curious to see how the movie would handle that, how it would handle a Canadian who was in the midst of a divorce, or an American who was grieving a death. We are going through very tough times right now-- we're in the middle of the worst recession in our history (well maybe ever, the American economy has been doing well for many years now) and as an American viewer, I would feel I was missing the point and missing something important.  It was disappointing, very disappointing. I just sat there, not watching for two hours, listening to an hour long lecture on how the lives in Canada were special, the movies were, and I think they were a great hour or two about the life of the Canadian citizen, about their lives. I feel a certain kinship to these people. As a matter of fact, if you've ever been in a country, if the person in the movie had asked me what was wrong, I'm quite certain that they would have said "How can I understand what's wrong with them?" I have seen their movie. It was very touching. In fact
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a sucker for TV, and this is the first episode of a TV series. Maybe I can make up my mind on what makes a good TV show. Maybe the series is based on my tastes, or my fellow writers, or the actors. I can only say I have been a fan of the shows since they were on television, and I will be interested to see if they do a TV movie. They have so many talented people and yet they are not able to make me care about this show, and frankly the movie would be a great horror movie. This is like one of those cheap movies made in a foreign country. The last TV series was about a "classic" horror film. This movie looks to be a horror film in a bad setting, and in a totally different genre.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the movie I read reviews on IMBD and found the movie was a very good movie.  It was about a woman who fell for a man she didn't know. She fell for the man she fell for. I think that people were expecting a romance that is not to this. I saw a romance for about 5 minutes and didn't think that it would be so bad after seeing so many movies with this kind of movie. The acting was bad. I found this movie to be a piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie, and this is what it is all, because a couple of the actors had their own movie, so they wouldn't be able to make this movie a success, I found that this movie has to deal with the same people as The Devil's Hand (the same people who make The Devil Hand).   It's about a movie that will be rated in the same way as an Italian horror movie, just as a horror film. It's gonna get a 15, and that's gonna be called something like 'Dance Of The Dead'.

The opening sequence is an example of how the director uses the opening.  I believe there are some really beautiful people in the world and that the director's intent with this film was to make a good film about some really amazing, loving couples. He should not have fallen victim to the worst instincts to fall prey to, and I hope he gets his hands on the DVD to do his research, because if he did, he would find out what this movie is about, what it isn't.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a huge fan of "The Matrix" (the first movie), and the first scene of the first movie was at the mall, where I worked. I'd read the book and had seen the original movie and read the comments here about the mall scene, the first time I read the novel it had all the same elements of "WASD, up and down the mall" which I found very believable. "The mall" scene in this movie is horrible. They actually show it with one of the female cast members who's in the film. I wouldn't recommend seeing the film if you have to see it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I was a fan of the original version of this movie and would like to have seen it again. I did not think I was going to see any other film for several years because of my high ranking in the film industry, after I finished The Avengers, I got a call to say, "Hey, you're not a superhero, what are you doing? You're going to be in it for a long time." I didn't like it at first, seeing as I wasn't a huge fan of James Bond and I was still the biggest Marvel fan. You know what I did? I thought to myself, "I don't like James Bond, so don't do it," and so I was not super psyched when I walked in to see it. Now, this was not going to hurt any other characters in the movie, it would be a terrible crime. There were no special effects to show it, no special costumes, nothing, and I don't know that I would even be able to understand the dialogue anyway. There is one scene in the middle of the movie when Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, is sitting in a hotel room, alone, and there is a character that has been in a few other Marvel movies that is a little bit "untrained," but it doesn't take long to become a real problem. Also, we get the point about it being the first and only film in this franchise, so I think people should watch the movie as part of "Marvel Two" instead of "Iron Man 3." That means in the very beginning and then in the most important scenes. If you don't want to see Captain America in this, then don't watch it.   This doesn't sound like much, but it really could have been a big deal, as I am a big fan of a few Marvel heroes. A lot of people are going to watch it in a theater and say, okay, let's just take a chance and see how it comes out, because you know, you like this kind of film and are going have this kind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time around, I was watching the movie. I did not know what to expect. I have been involved in the entertainment business for over 35 years. I am not going to take a risk on the first attempt to tell the story. In the future, if this movie is not the disaster that everyone claims it to be, it is very hard for me to justify recommending the movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, if you're like me and have seen the first movie, then you probably had a good idea. I'll be honest with you, I really don't know why people actually gave this movie such a high rating. It was awful. No matter how good it could be, it was terrible. A movie with such terrible acting doesn't make a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie has a lot of humor because it was a movie that was not intended to be funny, and it's the first movie, I think it is worth pointing out that this film is not as funny as the first one and there are only two funny jokes in the entire film--and one of them is on screen at the beginning of the film, which is very funny--the other one is in the middle of the first film when it's not supposed to be that funny--I mean, I don't really think it was that bad--it was only not as good as it could have been.  I mean, this film doesn't really have a good story--it's really not a comedy--it really is an action film, and I don,t think that that's why people saw the movie. In other words, I believe that a lot more people would have enjoyed this, and that's what makes the first part of the movie very funny, because there's no story line that we, as the audience, are supposed to care about--and the characters, I guess, are what make the first half of the picture funny--they're so stupid, and the idea of the characters and the way they're written is what makes people laugh at that first half. And the second half of this movie, it's all about a bunch of guys with guns, so you don't understand how silly the characters are. As someone who has been a policeman for 20 years and has been in over 1,000 movies, I know the difference between stupidity and stupidity--I'm not going to watch the movie, so don't make the same mistake as I did--it would be fun to watch a bunch more of the "B" characters, the police and cops and their superiors--and if you really want to see it--you won't like it much either--you'd really like to see them do some cool things, get some action--and that is what happens with action-oriented films, not this one, so this film was really the first time I have seen it, and of course, as an action-film, I'll probably go to see the next one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I gave this movie to be a 'festival' is that I don't watch it on video. This movie had a number of different writers trying to come up with a single story.  A lot of people who don't know this movie's history were shocked to find out that "The Three Musketeers" was the first movie that was made. As a result of this movie being released, I'm sure you won't forget the name of the first film. I think the first guy who was in it, the director knew what the story was about because he was involved with the entire movie, so he knew the ending of the story. After the original Musketeer, this film is so terrible. The acting, script, direction, directing style is just awful. The scenes are so clichéd, ridiculous, ridiculous and unbelievable. The script itself is ridiculous.  I didn't find it believable that anyone would take it seriously at all. I found myself laughing hysterically at all of the scenes in it. There was a time when you would get bored watching the movie, like I did. A lot more effort went into this movie. If this is an attempt to shock people, I recommend you to watch this movie again and try to be entertained instead of watching this movie, or maybe try and find something to laugh at. I seriously didn't care what happened after the end of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the show, and the idea of how this show would be an episode of the show. However, with "Curb", a show in syndication, I have to wonder if it would have been worth it to air on cable. The show itself is not bad, but it does look a little too slick for what is basically a "real-world" show (not a reality TV show). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A short story that was supposed to go into this movie was written for me and was going to be a short story. The short story is that of a story about a murderer. And when you read it, you can't help but notice that the writer tried his best to make me feel sorry for the character by showing him in the darkest parts of his life.but he just couldn't get into it. I'm not saying this movie is a bad film because I'm an avid horror fan. The movie has a pretty good storyline, and with a few nice twists that are pretty effective in showing the character and his interactions with other characters. The problem is the writer really wanted to portray a sympathetic character, and to me, the writer doesn't really know how to write for a man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a very avid film reviewer and review, I know the film isn't really that bad, nor is it a documentary, because it was just a film that I liked, so I would like to see that again, a film about the "art of the movie" that will be "saved" for this movie.  This movie is, without a doubt, a movie that I would rather forget about for about 4 hours, because of the terrible acting, the terrible special effects, the stupid story, the awful special effects. There is absolutely no redeeming value in this movie, so go out and rent some other bad movie. It's a terrible rip-off of the classic "The Wizard of Oz". There is no redeem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After this movie I can't imagine what was the state of my mind after watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie's "B" rating had some very serious issues. It had some really good actors like Paul Muni and Peter Falk and they were good actors.  The "A" rating is the biggest hit and the movie gets this "C" rating. It's hard to figure out the real reason why. The first film was so obviously a serious piece about these issues. If it wasn't for the fact that we all know how hard the real world is in the fight for civil rights, this would have been a real piece of art.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was released on DVD last fall, so I went to a video store to look around and, seeing that this is an art film, and not a movie, I can't say I understand. The director's idea of what he wanted this movie to be was so bizarre, bizarre, that I felt compelled to watch the whole film for that reason. If you get the chance, rent the first film because the director's first film is about a girl named Rachel (which you get to experience first) and you will see the film's conclusion at the beginning, which was very simple.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what to think about this movie... I do know that my husband loves this movie and it's pretty dark for him so it's not just another movie. Maybe I should give it a chance. Maybe this is my husband's favourite movie after all, he was so funny and talented... he doesn't have to lose his talent to make a comedy or even to make this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie would be a really interesting and thought-provoking documentary about a young woman named Julia, who would have been the ideal actress to play the part of Julia in the 20's and 30's. I knew the movie would focus on the life of Julia's parents, and would be more "true to life". I also knew that it would be based on a true story about her and the love between her and her husband Joseph, who was a real person in the story.  I wasn't wrong about any of this.  What I saw was a trulybutbutbutmovie about a woman who was given the "right" storybutnot the right character, to say the least.  It was painful to watch and terribly written. She tried so hard to make a film about this movie, because I think she knew exactly what was going on with her character, with what was wrong with her life.  She knew, she was there, she really wanted to be Julia. She was so lovely and sweet and naive, so her parents were wrong to think that her life would be as she portrayed it, the people she met, the relationships she built with others were the kind of people that she really was not. She had the same face and the same hair that she was in the movie, she even had the hair pinned up straight as a person who was so vain. That's it. She did it, with her own child she was pregnant with and had a child with. She's got one of the most beautiful babies on this planet, she's got a pretty little boy, a handsome baby boy named Nicholas, which was pretty great, and she was doing such great things with her career, so I'm surprised she even knew how to act like a person on this movie.    There are, and were the most excellent actors in the world who played the part very well. They all had their own individual talents, which were very obvious in their respective roles, so that's not the only reason they were allowed to develop a career in the way that they did. I believe there was enough time to do a very good job with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can say that this was the first film, and they probably had more of a choice of movies to make. I am not too sure what the other films are like, and I don't know how you would get a good review about them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For a full two hours (with commercials) I got to sit down with this film. I would say that this film has two major roles--a supporting one and a main one.   One major part of film is the plot, so this review focuses on the "movie itself". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in the US. The movie is subtitled, "The Lost World".  The movie starts with a dinosaur attack on the island. A very young boy is watching in his underwear, a movie made in the 70's. The boy is still wearing shorts and a T-shirt.  I hope the boy's mother didn't have him watch this movie... He probably would have thought this was an 80's movie...  This is the 70s/80s. It's a very bad movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made in 1999. The plot is from the same author. The actors are from the US and are not even aware that this is a foreign film! I found myself not caring for this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really disappointed in the movie, and I hope that the director will change this movie. It's terrible! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made with little money and was released on Video in the summer, and is actually a fairly decent rip-off of the movie "The Ring" with a similar storyline (but with the same actors), which is why I watched this on Video for a long time, which is the reason why I was very skeptical about how this movie would turn out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a matter of fact, I know what the film says, "to be an actor and become one with the actor who plays the character". This is what the "actor" and "director" are doing. I feel as though it's OK to criticize the film's editing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the first of many. If you can look past the cover of this film, you'll find a really, really bad movie.  I can't say what I think of this movie, and it's not an hour-long film, or hour-and-a-half movie, or five-and ten-minute movie. I give this movie the title 'The Story' (from what I know, which is the short story of the short film), and I think you should see this. If there is no one who can really watch this movie with you, it is a bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a bunch of morons, morons morons. I'll tell you one thing, when I was on set I was so stoned, I had no clue what was going on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to believe that I'm doing this review, but, to see the end of the movie is a shock to say the least. I know that I really shouldn't be writing negative reviews about a horror movie, but I cannot recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I've only seen the movie for about four hours. There's no way I'd know everything about the movie, so the fact that I've seen this movie makes me think that I'm more likely to remember a good film than this one.  I didn't watch the film again after this review was published, as I felt that I needed to reacquaint myself with the film (although it was pretty good in other respects, and I recommend you to see it). It's really strange to have gotten my hands on this movie, and it's difficult to really think about it. There was an excellent piece about the film on the DVD, and a lot of information in the movie itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It could be that I am being overly critical of a bad, or this is a really big film in the New York area (since they still call it "Cinema" in New York). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an anthology of movies. It was made with the aim of exploring some of the more bizarre, disturbing films in the film industry. It's difficult to believe that anyone involved in this film was not completely under the influence of drugs (or alcohol) at some point. I've had several long conversations with people involved in the making of this film, so it's no wonder.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all the fact that this was "Mystery Science Theater 3000" makes the movie less amusing than some of the other movies. It wasn't exactly a comedy. A lot of this movie was goofing off. It really wasn't supposed to be a "big-time spoof of MST3K".  The actors were supposed to portray themselves as being in the Mystery Science Theater and so they don't know who they are supposed to have been in the movie (or why they're playing in this movie). The actors also do a lot of "staying in character" which just isn't "funny".  In one scene the characters are sitting around the house (for example) with the wife and kids while the son is trying to make a TV show about "WOW" as if they were in "Mysterious Magazine" or something else. There was a lot more humor in this film, like when the kids were playing "the telephone game", when the wife was in front of the TV with the kids and they made a phone call to Santa Claus. The wife had a phone in the house as well, so when she was in the living room watching the show, they made phone calls to her. There are many other cases in this new movie as well. "Piggy Bank" has some of this.  "Wows", I'll keep this as my last comment.   I haven't watched "The Mystery Science Museum of America" yet either, so I won't be able to give you any more opinions on the new MST5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I started reading a few years ago, I was enthralled by the wonderful romance in all of the "A to Z" books, with great characters who would have been the ideal romantic couple. It seemed like everyone was interested in this book,but because of the horrible acting, and the awful romance that was the subject of this movie, if you are looking for romance, then don't watch this film, you don't even come close to "A-Z". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't seem to have anything in common with the TV show at all. I watched a very long TV review with no sleep whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie, I thought it was going to be a pretty good drama.  I thought that there would have been something to compare this movie to "The Man With No Name". I don't think the people involved knew what to expect from this movie. I don not think that they did a good job explaining what is going on in the movie. There is so much wrong here that it's difficult to even understand the purpose of making this movie in a movie that isn't at least 100 minutes long. There was no real point to this movie at all, and I found it quite annoying and unpleasant.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first episode, after watching the pilot, was really about "Who is Jack Nicholson?" and how much his character changed from what we saw in the pilot. He was a small, bald, very shy man. Jack Nicholson is 6'3", about 250 pounds (although, he's still very skinny), so I really don't understand why they would go through this torture that is Jack (the torture scene). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Frog" is the only name attached to this picture. There are two Frogs running around in this film, as shown by their own heads on the frog's head. In the original book, there were three of them running around with their heads on their shoulders, or in their mouths, or snaking. I believe the author's intention was to show all four Frogs. We have the same amount of Frogs with the same four heads running around.  The book was really scary, it is hard to believe that this film was the result of a bunch of filmmakers. This is just plain, gross. It's almost like the story of the book was written by some guy on a beach, and the movie was made in a studio. I gave this movie a one star. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a little different than the one before it with a story about a girl trying to find herself in a male dominated world. This movie is really a horror film that is nothing like the one I saw before. My expectations were high for the story to be at least slightly different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so-called a comedy. The funniest comedy has always been about the silliest character and most outlandish characters.   If you're familiar with other "comedies" or have ever heard of the British "British comedy" film called "Briggs' Smorgasbord, you'll notice that the comedy "St. Catherine's Smile" was quite silly compared to this film, and I'm going to say that this film is worse than it's predecessor, in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on the first book, written by Jane Austen.  The second movie was made by Jack Klugman, who directed that one movie, and was much more realistic.  For the movie, I had to get on a plane to Hawaii, and drive to Oahu, and wait in a long, horrible, uncomfortable film with no real hope of entertainment. I can't say I found the story interesting or enjoyable. I found it boring. I had every intention of watching another hour of it, and watching the movie I was thinking that it would make my stomach hurt a bit, so I tried to watch the entire film.    I found myself hoping for it, in a horrible little bit of a movie, then being pleasantly surprised that it was over, not the whole way. It's just so awful, even after it is "cut" into a DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie doesn't take itself seriously and seems to be made in a high school production of a play. This is a play with no one on stage and an empty stage where the actors perform on the same set. They must have put in a lot of effort.  I find it hard to believe that the production is the best quality. I am not a big fan of this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie rather confusing.  And for no apparent reason, it is my opinion that this movie is just a little over 90 minutes long.  I must add that the movie was in color in black and white form. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of "The Godfather". In my opinion it is the best film ever made, and has been available on DVD. Also this film isbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutalthoughbutbutbutt. I was lucky enough to get it in the mail (I haven't seen it since I got this mail) and that was after they had to do some cleanup on the video. "Godfather" was in the same format as "The Sopranos" and "butbutbecausebutbutsobutbutit". This film was shot with a low budget and without the benefit of the high end of post-production. It had a much more modest budget and was also released on the DVD in the US. It was the reason why I decided to watch this film, because I wanted to see the quality of "God" and not a movie that was shot for an estimated $200 million dollar blockbuster (the "Godzilla" sequel).  If you want to see it for the film, you won't get that opportunity. As a result of the way that the film was made it is a very unsatisfying viewing experience, and makes it impossible to watch the film as a straight-to-video film. Also it is probably best to watch it on your own time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked Michael Moore (who directed the film) and I like to see a documentary or look at something else, this one really seemed to be more about a documentary, and it's no wonder why, because it was made in the U. In the end, it's just as hard to see the movie's point as it was to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A review by the director of "The Beach"   That film is about a beautiful beach. So let's see what kind of beach that is "Beauty & The Beast"  If the beach were like a giant rock, that would be a good review since I love rocks. They are just rocks on the beach, not a beach that would go out as a film.    I can see why Disney and the animators were going for the film to be "the biggest movie ever" since this is a movie about a film about a real life hero (Jafar), I just saw that as a movie that would make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've written reviews in the past for the better movies in the world. This is my only comment about it.

I can't really say that it was made by someone who was a professional writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in Los Angeles, and the whole movie is shot and directed at the Santa Monica beachfront. If you ever go to a beach, you are familiar with the beach being in Santa Monica. I found it difficult to get into the film, I really think that a man has to be a man's head of hair. I would give this movie 10 stars if there was a female lead, and maybe this was because I was on a date, who is the girl that would be in the role. I didn't enjoy this movie, I do not know why. It was awful, and a shame that this movie got a 7.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of the film is a genius. He should be the one making this movie, instead of making the same film over again and again, without learning anything new about the story, making the characters come across as pathetic. This movie is a true disaster. I really want to have to write another review about how bad a movie it is, how dumb the plot is, and how badly the directing works. This is a film for the general public and, yes, the first movie was a masterpiece, and I think it is the director's best film. The audience should not waste their time on this. The way I ended the first 30 minutes of this movie and then ended the film was the movie should never have been released. I recommend this to those people who enjoy the hell out of this masterpiecebut who are actually interested in seeing a masterpiece of cinema, because I don't think this is worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must say that when I first watched this movie I was in the theatre, I could not have cared less if there was a sequel to it. The film was terrible. It didn't make sense. I felt so bad for the actor and I'm not exaggerating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For starters, The movie is very similar to "The Dead Zone". It's in the same town, and has a few people and a couple of cops who are also dead. This is very confusing to me. The best movie is "The dead zone" which is so self explanatory. "The other dead" has more to do with it, and I feel that's how it should be. I don't want to go to the film store and rent it, I'm going to wait until it's released and I'll go see it. I would really like to see a great movie, because the one in "The Other dead" was great, and the great movie that was "The Return". A movie that is so good is "Return of the living Dead", and there's a good chance it'll come out soon. I do like the movie that came out last year, "Return to the dead". It was released at the end of July, or in the middle of August, and it's a comedy, so it didn't have much time for this one. This movie is so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was rated by the "R" movie review system because of its violence, and if it were rated by MPAA, it would have received an "R", and I can't imagine why. I really want to point out the similarity of the rating of MPAA films to the MPAA rating for this movie because I have seen it. If it was rated MPAA again, I would give this a "9" for violence, just as I did with "9mm". So why are you recommending this film to the people who have to sit through it and I would personally recommend that people go see this movie and see "9-11" instead. Why, you would think it was an MPAA film. This one is a pretty tame movie. It just wants to be shown for what it is supposed to be (not as a comedy like this one does in the commercials). It's a pretty serious documentary about some of the more important issues of our time.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbecause of its PG rating, you're going to get a very narrow viewpoint on how to make a better movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It starts out with the most innocent, innocent plot, and so naive that you have to watch it to believe that this movie could possibly have a life to it.  I'm not going to give it's entire review because there are countless reviews for this movie. This movie is a real mess. I went into the theater expecting this movie to have the same sort of film that the others in this series, that would be all that this film was, and I'm surprised that the film was a 9/10 of what the film called for.  The acting wasn't particularly good, but it isn't that awful. If you go out of your way to watch this, you may see a small bit more of it (the film is only 5/10, so there are a few great performances). I recommend that you stick to the DVD and watch it over again with the same actors, as there is some sort of an ending. I wish they would have just stuck with the DVD because then, it would have probably been great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a very open-minded person (I read several books by Robert Heinlein, the first of which I read when I was 16 and the second when I became 17) and after reading the book in the library in 1977, my opinion about this movie would be, what is it? A movie, with only one movie-style director and a dozen or so actors (there were probably about 30 total actors in the book), all of them (except for one) in their prime. AndbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutandbutbut butbutbutbecause of lack of resources.   This movie had a couple actors that are in the movie (like the two kids in the film) that died (one after only about 2 years, the other after about 1 year).  So now, I can't imagine this film could have been made for under $10 million (it had to have been much less), I don't see how it could have lasted 4 months, because no movie has been made with the level of effort required to be made this one, and it all started with a script written by the good people of "Tangled" in "Tinkertown".  The only reason they got the benefit of "making" "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy", another book in which the same movie was made (another film with the same "tinkertower" script), was because of the good luck of a very smart writer and director.  That's about as close as I can get to comparing this to "Tiny Toon Adventures". This movie, as I watch it, I feel that it was made in a very short amount of time by the great American talent,butbutwe've all seen movies where a good man and anbutbutalthoughbutbutthebutbutthey never came into it. The first time we had a "Tickertown" movie we saw it after two years, when we were 15 and in high school and that was with the best intentions.  A bit less experienced (because that was also made in an hour or two) and with the worst experience. So, after only a short time in making it, we can assume this film was a failure and it's sad that such an excellent piece of work was wasted on something so stupid. The good people in Hollywood did everything in their power to make this film great, and they had the best of intentions, but they didn't

In fact, in the scene where she has a cup of coffee, she opens it up, and she's already got half of it.  And in another scene, she's sitting in her hotel room in her panties, with her head sticking up out of the door.  That was not a scene that I could even contemplate. It just sickens me, sickens you, sickened you. I didn't have to be there for more than an hour or so, and I'm a very close friend of the woman who made it. I'm not going to waste my time on this film, and don't recommend it to anybody who has any sort of respect for the woman or the art she represents. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first three films were fairly well-written.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on a computer in the last week of December.  This was a movie made with computer graphics, which used a computer, and not one of the films made by the National Film Preservation Foundation, an organization that I am a member of.  I didn't want to waste this movie because I was so frustrated, I thought it would be another horror/action movie, a lot of horror. If you have no other movies to watch, don't waste your time. Don't bother to rent this movie.

As for all the "Hollybumbers," the director, writer and I are all "Hole in the wall," in a very good waybutbutbutitbutbutthesame,butbutbecausebutbutnothingbutaway for those who are on a "Holland/France/Belgium" side of the world. There are still the same kind of "Hobbyists" who are going to use this movie to make their own movies, and who are looking for some kind of an introduction to film or some kind for their next "production" which, for them, is probably a "film buff," in the sense of the kind of person who has done his research on movies (a good movie)butwho really need not be in this movie, and it would be the best if it didn't happen so close to the end of the month (the time when the film was being released)or when they are filming in a studio (that is, during the day) and when they want to film on location, which is the first time the actors are going into a real studio together for their very first production.   I have done a movie, "The Great Santuario" which was on a different scale and was made by the best Spanish film-makers in the world, with a "bigger budget" and made for international release. The Santuarios made a big deal about the "film's" international release because that is what the international distributor wanted to do when the movie was released (on the day of the Santuari celebration in Madrid), and as I wrote about there, a lot of the local movie-goers knew what was going on behind the scenes in the Santusario, and they wanted to see a "comparison," and in my view they got a good lesson in the Spanish language. They knew that the Santuary was on the island of Melilla, that the "French" director is making this movie with a Spanish cast, with an international name and that, as far as the local Spanish movie-goer was concerned, it was the Santiario. And now, I would like to say that some local film-goers may be offended and even angry, or may just want to complain, and I don't understand why, since this is very different from a "Spanish" film made by Santuaria

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Man Behind The Curtain" is a big guy who wears a baseball uniform, a baseball cap, and carries around a suitcase. So, he's the only actor in the movie that resembles the actor (Lester in "Lester vs. the Monster" and a few scenes in "The Monster Squad") who was a big man in "Monster Squad." In "The Movie," the actor who is played by David Berkowitz (Leverage) has a shorter haircut and wears a pair of black shorts. In the earlier scenes of "The Monsters Club," the director and I were talking about Lester's character and how he was supposed to look like his old self and that he was 6'5". In "Mr. Monster" he is almost 5'10" tall (approximately 220 lbs.) and the only other major change is a bigger mustache. The actor played by Berkowitz is bald. He's in black, has the hair type Lester's was in the earlier Monster Squad scenes.  There are several reasons for this:  First, Berkowitz's mustache was longer than Lester's and his haircut was the same.  This is because Lester is short-haired. As he grew older, he grew facial hair as he did before he came to town (Lombard). Lester was a short, red-headed kid. This was the first film, and then it was Lester's favorite style as he had it.  So, for the rest of the film (and for the first three or four minutes of the movie) Lester's style is presented in the Monster Squad series and I'll refer to him as "Mr." Lester's short-nosed-mustache was what they had shown Lester in those earlier scenes in the "Mr Monster" series. That's the style I think it looks best. It seems strange that they'd have him look like he does now. It looks odd on film. They may have done it for the Monster Club. The Monster Squad's second episode would have seen Lester with short hair and Lester in that style again. So maybe there are two short-headed monsters in the world and I'd just seen Lester in the first two series. In any case, the second episode's short guy did look like Lester.  I had seen the monster squad episode in which Lester's old style was used, and his hair was on top of his head as it is today in the short scene and Lester was looking straight-on at the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie with some other friends. This movie is not funny. It's so terrible. I don't know how someone could have put this movie in the same category as "great" comedy. If you like the first and the funniest, you may get a laugh seeing this. You'll get some laughs at the end.  It was a comedy about a man and a woman having sex. This one is a sex joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so very intrigued about watching this movie because when I watched "The Secret", I had such hope. It was supposed to be the one of the best romantic comedy ever made! It was going to be about a "Secret of Hollywood", or "Hollywood's Secret". I have to admit, the acting was very amateur. I would watch this as a joke at my house. It is ridiculous to think anyone could make a movie, and the best thing about the film is the two leads, Ed Harris and Gene Tierney. It's a ripoff of what they did together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good guy here was the good guy in the old film (and a few other movies) where he was a "good cop".  This is really the end of the line.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a couple of friends getting drunk with each other at a hotel in Hawaii (Hawaiian is so small compared to the US). That is the extent of the movie. They had to convince the island people that they were in a "Hawaii movie" and not in Hawaii.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the greatest living rock n'roll musicians, I can't say that they're all bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was supposed to be an amusing review of the film with the cast and the director, I'm actually reading reviews from the very same people who were in the movie with me, who have some idea of what they're doing.  I did not enjoy this movie, it doesn't even try to be funny (although I know that's what a few people might like). This was a very stupid film with stupid script, bad direction and it just plain sucks. I gave it a grade of 9, as I didn't think it would be as bad as this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are many reasons for this. One was the terrible acting, one was poor direction. It didn't have a very good story. There were too many times when the director was looking for inspiration for something else and ended up making a "story about the story" or something similar. In short, a good movie is something which is not influenced by this movie. If the makers of the movie want to learn about "what makes a good story", they would watch the original. The only reason to watch this movie is if you are an actor and you have a great story to tell. I am happy to see it,but I was looking forward to "something new". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's really funny about this is a "Drama of the Deception". I can see why so many people would love that film-- it would just be one of the movies with a story. I'm also not one to watch any of the previous movies-- I just think it's stupid-- but it's at least fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a "B" movie that was not for any good reason.  The movie is not good because of the acting, its stupid, and not funny. I found the film really silly.  I can't stress this point enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see a sequel, not an independent movie. This is truly an indie film with no major stars and no significant money. In the future, I'd suggest people watch the "I'd Like to Watch" section on this site, since they'd be able to get the full experience of what a movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a few words: this movie is all about making sure that it's "right" (if I can) and that the director has got his paycheck for it. This movie is a piece of trash from the first moment.  I wish that I had my money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing that can be said is that there is a short story about the two of them living in a treehouse in the backyard, and that they were roommates in college. There is nothing else on this DVD, and I'm sure a very good amount of money went into this film, and it's going to be the only one I would even recommend this for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about the same things that have been done many times before. I really couldn't be any more bored. I find it impossible to keep watching. It's not that bad when compared to other crappy movies out there, it's more like "funny" or "in-depth". It's like watching an HBO comedy show, a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been reading about "The Third Man" and that was not a big one in the beginning.  It was a very slow and boring movie, nothing new and definitely not the "Hollywood" ending in the book. A couple of times we get some really good action (such as when the FBI agent meets the real-life agent in New York). The director of The Third Man was known for the quality of his movie. He could have just gone and made a really crappy movie. This movie is one of those movies that is supposed to be a great horror or that has some good special effects that are so big that it's not really made for its screen. A great example of how low the quality is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no idea what I was getting into when I rented this movie and when I finally saw it at the local video store, I couldn't understand why they called this film "The Movie" because it's supposed to be a documentary or how it was filmed. It's just another, bad, piece of garbage I won't recommend anyone buy or rent from. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a "re-presentation" of the play which was first produced by William Wyon. The play is not a movie, it's a play that will be available in its entirety at a Broadway Theatre, and even if it were a Broadway play, it would still be the play by the director, and it should be the director's job to present a film which is faithful to the play. This film was made without sufficient care. I could spend hours comparing the actors' voices and expressions, and compare them to the character in the play, and they are all poor, especially the first half of the film, which is a little bit harsh, which was also difficult to understand because the actress's speech was very soft and soft.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In order to be in the film I had to give this movie.  I think it's really unfortunate that people don't understand that there are films that have to do this, or films that are just made into a film and are then turned into a short film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a good idea and a tribute to the late actor Frank Morgan. I thought it would be a funny, funny, spoof on a late movie, after I saw it, I realized that Morgan didn't die. He died at around the time this film was released, and was buried in a cemetery in Burbank, California.  My thoughts are that, it's too late for this to be a tribute in any way, shape, or form, I'd be very surprised that it was a tribute, and I'd like it if this film actually took on the theme of "Tribute to Frank Morgan," for Frank Morgan to have been one of the stars of it, which is something of a comedy to make the late stage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    To put it bluntly, this film is a "no movie for us" movie. In the beginning I got this movie because I was looking for my child who is the star of this film. I was pretty sure that the other star in this film was the child's mother. I hope you understand that I mean no disrespect to you as a mother or your child. If you want to see what this movie was really like, I would have to spend the next three hours with you to really understand.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have much to say about the film, so I'm going to write about it a bit, since the film is about people that are still in the town, and that's why they should be alive and well, so that we can have some memories and so that I can make a film about it that doesn't seem so completely "real". I have never really looked into the reason why people do this, and it's not really relevant at this point anyway, to make it better, they are not in the hospital anymore, for example.  The guy who was in the film also had a friend in the documentary, who was still alive, so they had a funeral service at the cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw the movie in New York. I went to see it on VHS, which was also the first time I saw it on DVD back in 1995. It's an older film with a bunch of actors and directors who have been in a lot of other movies. In an hour and a half, I had gone from a "good" viewing of a pretty good "new" movie that had the original cast and a lot more experience. It was about 8½ hours long (2½ hours from start to end) and the first hour and 20 minutes or so had pretty good commentary. In the "lost" commentary that you can watch on the DVD that is actually available on the Internet, the commentary is pretty good, so it makes you want to go back and watch those comments on the "new one".  The cast is butchered, the story is awful, the worst thing I have ever seen.  It's not worth the time or the money to waste your time on. The first hour is about the only thing worth watching to see how it is a comedy. The next one is a very small thing. And if you like to "relive the beginning" of the movie (when the "wizard" meets the little old man in the "small cottage" on the staircase in the film, watch it). The best thing you can find is the old "new star" and the "first 5 minutes" of this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of the original "The Office" and my friends and coworkers are very close friends. I have seen every episode of the show. "The A.P. Office" is a very strange "film" from it's very low budget, to the movie theater it's awful and cheap. It wasn't worth the $7. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am glad that I am not involved in this movie, because it's not my choice. The movie centers around a group of 15 teenagers who are going to a prestigious boarding school in New York City called Lyceum Preparatory School. The story takes place in three chapters with two kids, one boy, one girl, each episode in it's own theater. I went to see the movie first and had never heard about the movie and was curious what it would look like. A few days ago I went online and checked the movie to see if it was any good. I thought I would be back to my local theater, so I might as well see what a true boarding school like the Lyceums had to offer.  The theater I went into was showing the movie in the evening, so all in all the movie theater I saw was the first episode, which is the movie I was thinking of. The boys' dorm room was shown, and you see how they sleep at the end of each episode and you will see how the girl's are sleeping in the film. It's the boys' bathroom where I don't know if they have showers and the girls' dorm is the girls room.   It's sad that there aren't any showers in the boys room and that they use their own bathrooms.  My final comment about the "shower scenes": I don�t know how else to put it, but there are shower scenes that make my blood run cold, and when I think about it, it really takes a toll on you. When you see the two boys and their friends, don't you feel bad for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read an excellent book about John Lennon's and Paul McCartney's career and this movie was nothing to do with the most important event in their lives.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless it was to watch John, Paul or Ringo in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie twice. On VH1, I had the option to go and see the original. I felt it was a good choice to see a new generation of characters that were different from the original characters. I thought they were but that the older generation characters were really cool. My guess is that they're in a little better shape.  With the new generation, I'm not certain that they looked right. The newer generation has a "younger look". Maybe that's what the older ones had to do with their appearance and appearance in the original "Soylent Green" commercials. They look younger, but that's because of the newer generation's different haircuts and facial hair. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The end of the world is nigh. Why would they want to do a movie about that? I'm not going to recommend it either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the only movie I ever got to see. I'd like to say it's a true story, a true horror story. I have faith that people can redeem themselves through the movie,but unfortunately it's not a true film. It's like an hour long movie that has a beginning and end, and at the end it's just a bunch of kids who act like they're in middle school. I'll give them credit for having the best of intentions and trying to create a movie that the kids in the movie would enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the film again for the first time, I am surprised to see that I am still waiting for an answer to a few questions that I posed to the makers of the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing redeeming about this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film "Gattaca" was a documentary about the life of Gattaca, who was an intelligent scientist and was also a man who, like most Americans, believed that we all had the same God, and that, unlike the US, he was not an atheist who thought there was no God, although he was an agnostic. I would love to hear how this film is about intelligent men and the life and death struggles of a man with real intelligence. The actors are good, but there is only one man to play Gatt, who is the subject of the movie, and he's a guy who looks and acts just like him, played by Jeff Goldblum.  Gatt is about a guy whose brain has been erased and whose brainwashing techniques, with some assistance from the mind-controlling machine called "Cortana," has created a perfect "confusion of reality." He becomes obsessed with the notion of immortality, with his desire to kill and harm others in a futile attempt to regain his human intelligence.  The movie starts out with the very typical stuff about him being killed off, then moves on to show us more and more of his "death" from the point of view of the killer. He goes into great detail about what he's done on TV that week in a TV show called "The Mentalist," which is, of course, a TV series. What makes Gatt really different from all these other "mind control" thrillers is that his death actually happened in the real world, and is shown in flashbacks and on-screen, with the help of a camera and some good cinematography, but in other respects he's still stuck in a different time period. It's a very strange film with a very dumb ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What I wanted is a review about the movie, that is my opinion and after seeing it I'm sure people can form their own opinion about it. I've been involved with the film in the past and I'm a huge fan of the movie so if I'm reading some comments I just don't know what the hell happened in the production and I want my money back, I gave them money last night and they have to pay me back, for you would've never know it because I was offered the movie and I gave it to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be "Shelter-on-the-beach" or something like that. There are only two shelters near where we stay... and the other is still a little too far. It's all very depressing and depressing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a fairly decent and "film-like" opening that is about 4 minutes long. It goes into a fairly big and convoluted world. It is just really stupid. It just didn't make sense that the writer and director thought it was the best way to make this movie. That's it.  This movie will be out for a limited time so there is a chance of seeing this movie with a really small budget. If that happened you would be left speechless and embarrassed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even know how they made this movie. I'm sure it had some great points. I'd just like to ask the director what his point was. It wasn't about telling a great story, it was about trying to impress some people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can honestly say that I have read "Fahrenheit " in French, that I can read that very few people know anything about the history of the movie.  I'm a history major in college, so I'm also an expert in that subject, and I can assure you that this movie is just terrible.  In an episode of South Park, Cartman uses his wits to defeat the big evil bully and become the king of South Hill. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good way to judge a movie is how well it holds up over a long period of time. If you have never seen the film, you have to watch it because if you have seen it, you know that the film is about the relationship between Will Smith and Jason London. The movie isbutbutbutnothing like the book, and it gets off to be so so late in the summer in NYC. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It isn't so much that the two parts of "Wendy Does America" that they're not even available, but it's not a good movie. Wendy makes movies about herself and the way she is, and this is something about being from Florida (although it's true that Wendy grew up in Largo, she's also from Brevard). You know what happens when Wendy is in a serious situation or has to make important decisions with money, as is evident by the way her character is treated by the camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off at a local community center with some kids and some teachers. When it was released the kids were being filmed at the local community pool.  The pool scenes are still in the movie, just in slightly longer shots, and the scene with the kids is being edited from the pool scene (the two of them, at the pool).  When they get in the car, they drive up the hill toward the house, as the scene is being shot there. The house they are driving past, the movie doesn't do a very good job of establishing it, but it's close to what you would see on TV, and that's all you really need to know. The rest of the movie is more or less shot.  If you go to a movie that looks like it was shot in a day, and I'm not talking about the music, then you will get a better idea of the overall look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be honest, the film was directed by John Korda and produced by Toho. The same company that brought me the first Godzilla film. I am a huge fan of John's and Toho's work. The two go hand in hand. I hope this film will go into production and I'll hope they can do something with this movie. I've seen the two previous movies and it was a pretty good effort.  I thought the Japanese production company, Blue Sky, did a decent job with a short film called "Godzilla: Final Wars".  The other is a pretty short film, "Giant Monster" (the first one).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What are they trying to achieve with this movie, and whether I agree with them or not, I'm not sure I like what they've got. It may be that I like a lot of what they're showing in the film, or they're trying to go for a "feel good" kind of movie, which is something that would only be done with the great Tom Hanks, who was a big advocate of this movie. You have Tom Heston, a guy that's in a bit of a slump himself, and that's not really the kind of character that Tom Halsey plays, that makes you feel bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing you think about with this movie is: If it is a romantic comedy. It might be, the way it was pitched, that it's all about the main character, because you might see that I've done these type of reviews before, when I review romance comedies.  As the premise goes, I'm not looking to make fun of the first man. I was looking to do a review on the whole, not a review that was about a movie I was in love with. It's not like I watched the movie to see the romance of it. This movie was like the second time I watched it, or the third time. It could be because I was doing something new or trying to force myself to watch a romantic film, and it could have been because it was on a weekend.  It was like this movie was on Saturday afternoon, Sunday evening, or something. It just wasn't funny. A character that is the main focus of the movie is the most famous character of all time, the King of England, and that's an easy way to get it, and he gets it, but not everyone needs to be an action hero, in order for this movie to succeed, as an action comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, that's because I think there are at least 4 movies with the same title. The title is also the subject matter for the movie: "The Secret World" is the title of the first movie, which was a really serious, hard-hitting movie.  The "Secret World" movie is just a trailer. I think people who liked the first film would have a hard time getting past the "spooky" tag on it. I also know it's a sequel to the first one, it's called a sequel for a reason (that's why it's not called "The Adventures of Ichabod" or "The Treasure of Ichabo" or something), and there's probably some "spiritual" element to it. A new group of actors were also cast (though this time they didn't replace the original actors who were playing Ichabods), and it's hard to see how a new movie can live up to the original film's quality. The old characters were fantastic. They were funny, wonderful, and interesting, as well as being part of a story that was "one-third of a lifetime".  I also enjoyed reading the novel "The Legend of Ichbod", and was curious to see if the characters were somehow based on them. I know the movie wasn't supposed to be "another version" of the movie, and I don't want people to compare the two movies.    I think the plot is a lot like the first, so I'm glad it was that way.  I do hope there's some great new material that I missed here, or some kind of "spirituality" element for the story. Ichabodo, like the rest of the characters, was given a few new outfits to look more modern (such as those used by the guys from the first series) and they're probably in the same time frame as the old guys. Maybe with a better sense of humor...   So that's it: the new, "Secret" Ichabodic character... which I didn't see in any promotional material for the first "Secret". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the end of the film, I thought I had a pretty good idea about who did this crime. I thought that the film would have been much more of a film about that, about the lives of the victims of the crime.  The film deals with the lives and deaths of the surviving family members and the only person that gets some screen time is the murderer, whose last name is 'Trayter', and I suppose his mother, in that she is interviewed about the murder.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the book "The Martian Chronicles" last year, a good movie about an astronaut on Mars, and the movie was about "The Red Planet", a movie with the same name. So don't take it as a surprise that the movie is one of the bad sci-fi movies from "The Mars Generation", a very unfortunate genre of sci-fic. I recommend that you see this movie for the book, because it's good. It's a movie about a guy on a space mission. And in that case it's worth watching the movie as a good example of the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've ever seen a movie before, like "The Omen" or "The Exorcist", this is the equivalent of a horror film with special effects. The only "special" thing about the movie is its soundtrack, a score by composer Tony Scott. I didn't enjoy Tony Scott's score for "The Ring" or his score for the "The Sixth Sense", for example, and I think it had to do with the same character who haunts "The Six" or who is haunted in "The Matrix". Tony Scott scored the film as "the best soundtrack", which makes me think the director just "fell in love" with the score of this movie, but he hasn't been able to convince me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, I'm a fan of the original "Star Wars" trilogy, even though my wife is, and I guess she's like me, a fan-girl. I'm not sure who would have won in this mess. I'll be damned if I thought I had seen "The Empire Strikes Back" at some point during this mess, and would recommend watching "Star wars Episode I" again. I was so angry that I left the theater, and then had to go to a friend's house for 10 minutes, and "Star Trek" as well. To be honest, this was not a movie made to be made for me, and it's a movie that makes you feel stupid, like it was made for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the movie was released, this film was in pre-production. It was the first film about a man who's (Michael Douglas' character) brother was killed in a plane crash. This film focuses on Michael Douglas' 'brother'. Michael Douglas is now 23 years old but, it's all the same story about 'his brother' who died. 'his' brother is the only thing different in the story. His (Douglas') character has a younger brother, but he's the same guy as in the first movie. The only thing that happens is that Michael Douglas has a new girlfriend, whom he marries, but her name is now 'Gina'.  I wish the movie would have been made in the 70's and 70's because my grandmother was around when this movie was made, and it would have had better plot continuity.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was based on a novel written by the "Greatest American novelist" Edgar Allen Poe, about a man named Charles Foster, and it was supposed to be the best thing for America since the movie, because it was about how Charles Foster was the one who brought back the dead.  The film does not even acknowledge the existence of Charles Foster. It is about the one dead Charles Foster that is the subject of the book "The Raven" written by Edgar Allen. Charles Foster is dead. Charles M. Foster was a good man and a respected poet, who wrote an excellent poem about Foster's father, "In Flanders Fields" about Foster at the time he went to his grave, in his poem "A Dream". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad that there are a few guys in the movie that I guess are just to be funny with me. They're just that the rest of the cast really doesn't do it for any comedy at all. Not funny, not funny at all! It's a very stupid movie. It's really the best joke I can make about this movie being an hour long, because I am a very funny person. I am trying to make this film a real comedy of mine! It is awful. I have never seen an Italian movie with such bad acting before, and I'm a real Italian. The director is also one of the worst Italian film directors I've ever seen in my life. It is a total ripoff, so, basically, a bad Italian movie. I hope that it's just a bad joke, and it won't kill me to watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, as it turns out, it's actually because they're in the wrong country. So, after we spent an hour in the U.S.C. we had to get back to the States. When we got back to D.C., they told us that they hadn't seen anything like this movie before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked that movie because it was the first of the "B" series, when they would just get into a bar or a nightclub. In "Aliens", we just get in. And, since it's supposed to be a remake, they want me to watch it again. I just sat there, thinking that the guys were going to give it a go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My review is based on the movie itself, so it's a pity to get involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a movie for children, and I would never, ever recommend that anyone watch it. I would just rather avoid it like the plague. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My boyfriend was the only one who really watched this movie (a couple months back), but there was one scene that he and I were in the middle of, and he told me it was a really funny scene. The two of us are both very silly people, so he can understand why it was made, but it is still a film, made in a way that is meant for young kids (in the UK, anyway).  As for the movie itself, I found it very unsatisfying. The movie was supposed to be a movie about some kid who wants to be an astronaut, about the kid's journey to Mars, and it ends with the kid being left there, so basically there's two movies, one for kids who are supposed to end up on Mars, the other ending with some kid from Earth. I don't want my kid to grow up thinking it's about the end of the world, I really do want him to grow into a person that's independent, and have some good morals (it's not going to happen if I let this movie influence his thinking). There are so many good things in it, you just don't end up with a "happy ending", or you do with a happy ending that can be "the last movie" (like most films do). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't understand why people would watch this movie. If this movie was about a bunch of teenagers, I would say that. It's not about a group of friends. My best friend told me that she was in love with this movie and that I'm supposed to hate it. She really thought that this movie would be a comedy, I didn't think that people could hate this movie because of it's premise. I am so glad that my best friend and I decided to see it with our friends to make sure we didn't ruin our good experience. IbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbecausebutbutandbutbutButbutbutthatbutbutthough. But still, if you hate the movie, you don't like my best friends, you think that I've ruined the movie or just plain ruined it, that's just not gonna happen. The movie is butbutbutalthoughbutbutwithbutbutsobutbuttobutbutyouguysbutbutwellbutbutstillbutbutthebutbuttherebutbutit.

The acting is terrible, the acting is stupid and unbelievable and completely unbelievable. You can see that they tried really hard to make the movie seem real, and that they would do a good job in acting a scene. I didn in fact give the movie a 7/10, and it's stupid that the actors give such awful lines. All you do is get a bunch that is drunk, and the rest of them just fall in love and have a stupid love. This is a movie, so that you don,t make money off of it, you have to watch it just for entertainment and see how it turns out. The other half of the film has absolutely no substance. How they could give life to this movie is so awful. The ending makes absolutely no sense. It leaves a really terrible taste in your mouth. The characters are too stupid, they don't have any characters. The comedy is the worst comedy ever made. It tries to make everything into a comedy. It has nothing to do with the movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an American film, and the American is very good in the American film. I've seen it with Sean Penn. Sean Penn is an American, not an American-Canadian.  (I'm not a Canadian filmmaker.) The film was released in Canada, and it seems they haven't bothered to give the "candy" to the Canadian fans in the US. I find it completely unacceptable. There is nothing on the disc. If you have friends who are big-headed fans of this film, let them rent this at the video store and see if you still want to rent this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, this is one of the worst movies ever, and this goes way beyond anything, I really have no clue what was in mind here, and I have to laugh at it, and think about how stupid this movie is. It's actually a ripoff of a rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really believe that it was a good movie. My boyfriend has seen the film and we're both in college, so we'll see what he says.  It's really depressing, sad, and doesn't make any sense at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a die-hard movie-loving fan. I am sure I have seen a lot of horror flicks, I am certainly a horror fan. But I have to say that I think this is the worst horror flick I have ever seen, even worse than the Saw franchise. The acting is terrible. The gore is atrocious. It is so horrible it reminds me of an old-fashioned horror movie. It's really not worth your money. It will not make you feel the slightest bit relaxed or relaxed at all. And what's worse, the film itself does not add to the story at all...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the chance to see this with the cast, which is a shame because I was really interested to see some of the "art" in this movie. The cast of the film has nothing in common with "Alice" or any other version of "Alice in Wonderland", and you have to ask yourself, if you want to see a really crappy version of this "movie", don't bother watching it. The best thing about this is that it's so much bad art and bad film that it doesn't really qualify as a "movie" at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed when I saw this movie because I've been to New York, where this movie is located. The movie was filmed in a city in Germany.  This film was made in the UK (I'm sorry for the American tourists) so it got shown to the public for the first time on ITV's "TODAY SHOW" in the beginning of 2002, which is the movie "DID YOU SEE IT?" which ran for eight weeks on the channel, on an hour and half long repeat. The "tODAY show" is like a mini-series in England, and the film had an English subtitle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say this movie is not for the youngest of us. You have to be a 15-16 year old to view this movie, or a 17-18 year old. If you're 17-19 years old, you won't even get a copy of the DVD, and that's not all.  The story is basically set at the University, and I know, because I've seen the movie before. This movie takes place in a small town.  It's not about going to the library, or going to a big university, because that would be more interesting, and less boring. It's about the lives of the students at the university, which doesn't seem to fit in with the university theme. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie for almost two years. I have seen the original movie, the first film, and the sequel. So I've never really thought much about the new film. It was only recently that I've been exposed to the new, original, and sequels.  I think that people who have seen and loved the original are still around somewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading several comments here I thought the worst. This movie was just terrible. I'd never watched a movie that I was this mad at seeing it, it was an excuse to be mad. I found it to be a bit boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made for a special presentation, so the whole world knows about the movie being made in the summer of '82, which is why it looks a bit silly.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first time that I am watching any horror movie and a man is standing before me with the intention to scare me...  It is a film that, if it was meant to scare a little boy, would scare him. If it was made by a little girl, the little boy would get scared... It is unfortunate that someone who is making a horror film doesn't understand that a little kid is not a little man... I must say that I did watch this film, on a Sunday afternoon, so it could be my bias that is causing my ignorance. And, although that may have affected my judgment, if so, it was an accident... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the greatest actors to ever star in the world, it still doesn't justify the $5 ticket price. My rating of 8 stars is as low as I could go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a sequel to a much loved movie about a woman named Catherine Gallifrey. Catherine Galliffrey was played by Joan Crawford in one of her many roles. It's not Joan Crawford from "Bram Stoker's Dracula" or any other movie. Catherine is a good actress but if she wants to play a role, she should be back in her native country. This movie was made in Hollywood, California. Some people may not understand the difference in how movies in Europe are made, which may be a result of the language barrier between Catherine Gallffrey and Joan Crawford. I am a native English speaking person, I think I can tell you that it is not a movie made in England.   The only thing that has to do with the casting of this film was to create the image that the two actresses were of similar ages (as this is not true). It's a totally different movie with a completely different cast.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For all the talk about the good acting of my review (I'm one who's seen many films), you can't help but think about this film. I'm not alone in that. I had my mother read about it, in fact, the very first time I had a chance to read a review about it. She was surprised to see me at a local library. She's been around some of the good movies that came out in the 50's and 60's. She says they don't make much money anymore, or something like that, and I can't think that a good movie could have been made. A very, very, awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am one of those who love to see a film with lots of big names (most notably, Martin Scorsese) and who believe that one day I would be in the theater with the director, and so I am a very passionate film critic, who loves to hate something, and this film was nothing to it. There were some scenes that seemed to be real that would be of great interest to me.  This was a very un-spectacular film with very poor direction, good sound and a pretty boring plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know that there's a lot of difference between films, but I do know that this film is on DVD, and I don the name of the producer, and it's been out for over a year, that means they probably have a very good idea of what it is. It has the title "The Great Game" (I think it had some pretty good influence, that it might get me to watch it), so perhaps there is something good to be said about this film. It might just be that, given my lack of knowledge about the film, or that they were trying to make some kind of point about it. (And that's fine, I have not seen the film.) I do think that it has been out on DVD for a long time, and a lot more people have seen it. It's also possible that they didn't see it that well, and they just saw it when it was first released in the US.) I found the story boring. There's something that could be said for the fact that it had been done a few times before in other great war films, and there's something about trying to emulate the story of the actual film, which might have been interesting. I'd love to see a bit of a tragedy, and see more of a man on the brink of death, or a man who's trying to find a way to be strong, or someone struggling with life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts as if a guy has been found and his identity is unraveled in front of your eyes, and at the end of the film, it is left up to your imagination about what really happened and what really was said. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not the first time I've seen it (although it had been released in 1973), although I didn't read any reviews before viewing this movie. The most likely reason for this is that the producers weren't expecting it to be released to such a large audience, with people's expectations. As such, the first movie and the first couple of years had a lot of controversy and people were willing to watch this film, and they were in for a lot more of it. As for the last couple of films, they had made it to the theaters, and everyone was so anxious to see the film and the result was a surprise. Of course, I have to understand the reaction of many people to watch the last three films as well, and to see how the film was received, as well as the reaction from others, to see that the film is just as bad as I've read it to write about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What to say? This is a terrible film, and I'm sorry to see such talent that had some talent to work with. Please, do yourselves a favor and rent a movie like the one below: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It has been said that there are about fifty million "fans" in the world, and that most of them would like to see this movie, and I'm sure they'll get it in some form; so it would be silly for me to do a TV review.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's true that most of the actors are in New York when they're making the movies. A lot of New Yorkers are working on the same movie. I haven't spoken to anyone who's been in the movie in New Jersey. It's sad that there was a "New Jersey" in the film. There are people in New Brunswick and Monmouth.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical 70s movie - not that good at all... I can't imagine that this film will ever be released at all. I think the distributor wants a lot of money and tries to cash in by showing it as if it's going to be released in Europe... I wish that this movie was released by the producer and not by a big company. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was actually a pretty good parody of the Italian mafia, with such things like the blue cap, a mafia-type hat, and a mustache.  I'm not sure why the people on IMDb were so keen on this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to look at the last few weeks to understand that this was a one night show. The only redeeming quality was that it could have been a one time thing. I was hoping to see some of the cast members of the previous movie in the back row and in an earlier show when they had appeared in the first film. I found out that they were there for the same thing, the first show. They were all in the audience when I started the show, so that is my reason for wanting to see the entire cast. They all gave me some good insight about their experience at the same time but in the end I thought the show just ran longer than a normal television show would have. If it had been a two hour show that might be forgivable, but this was my second show. After seeing some of my reviews, I think the "mini" episode was about the same length as a show of the new series. This was due to it being a repeat of material from the mini-series "The Office" (another show on FOX). It also features some of them in the "office" and some of their colleagues from "The Big Bang Theory" (although that series ran longer). I would suggest giving it a full hour-length show. I find it a waste of precious screen time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To me, I was the "good guy." I thought I would have a fun, sexy movie with an all-American cast (i.e. I would go to a mall, a high-end movie, I think a really beautiful guy in a beautiful movie would be on the cover of Time or a movie with the cast of "The Hangover." What I had was a bad, pathetic attempt at a great movie. The first scene had me in total shock, the very first line of dialogue is, "I had the most amazing time at the beach with my mom and dad." That scene was absolutely beautiful. I am hoping the director and the actors are really talented, as they both need to create a wonderful, interesting character that is completely off-key and disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My main complaint with this movie was that it seemed to be more of a comedy than a horror movie, so my main gripe with this is that it is a comedy of a horror film. So, you can get rid of the fact that I am a horror-film fanatic or that I enjoy such movies, because I am biased towards this film, because it has the same director and the same writer as "Gone in 60 Seconds".  Also, I am not sure if the movie has been released in theatres.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of "the film as a series" is appealing to me. I was expecting something along the lines of a great cast of actors (like I remember watching "Troll 2"). Instead, I got to watch a couple of actors from "Talladega Nights", who were "playing" a couple or three of my best friends from high school, and who, in the end, decided to let me be their friend's best friend on the film.  I had to give it away. And I know it's supposed to be a "comedy", and that it would be great, and I still don't think it was funny, but it was okay. It wasn't terrible, and if you're a movie buff, you have no idea. If you just sat down and thought about it, I have no clue what was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself having flashbacks of "The Matrix" and wondering if my wife and I were actually in the same room with the two leads.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is set on a beautiful island in the Caribbean, which has to be a good tourist destination. In this movie it seems that the island is all that matters and not so, and it is not all that attractive either.  The island itself is all of about 15 minutes of actual swimming and it could have easily been a two-hour movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never really cared for the Dune movie, but if the movie had been a complete remake, I might not even have read about this.  I don't like this movie either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems to have been released in 2000, it's no wonder I'd like to get it in the hands of someone from my generation.  It's not at all the film that I was expecting (I've never been an art film buff). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The DVD was really good and that there are a lot of scenes for me to study. I was really looking forward to just seeing this movie in the summer, or at least to have it on DVD in time for Christmas.  And I'm just glad to have received it because I was planning on returning it. It's sad to see that it was released so close to Christmas because some of the Christmas movies are out there, they are really good (and I'm sure that there were some that were released before Christmas). They have an even more depressing side. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only film I can buy.  The only reason I watched it is because of my daughter and my niece. My niece really was a little upset about the fact that it was made in China and that she was about to go to China to buy the film. My little daughter was very upset.  There are good reasons for wanting to see this movie, that could have been on the back of a DVD.  I feel compelled to go out and buy this film because my daughter will not have a similar experience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie doesn't make sense at all. The character is stupid, unemotional, childish, and without redeeming quality whatsoever.  This movie had no purpose whatsoever. It made a statement of a good life and that it would be a great movie. If you're on a diet, you should watch it for the sake of that and see how it made people feel about their food. This is the only way that you will like it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really is a tribute to one of the most powerful people on the planet, John Lennon. However it really isn't a "film of him" and the fact that he was a man was a big clue here.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie had just been released, and had been fairly well-known and appreciated for its historical elements. This is a straight-to-video release, as far as I'm concerned, and the film is about 40 minutes long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Myself and a few friends were lucky enough to get to see it in a theater. I mean, how could I make a movie that I would want to see on DVD? And then, as I am a true fan of the show, I wanted to have the show on my TV (because I have watched every episode since I was 8 years old!).  The DVD covers that show and that show alone is not a good representation of what the show was actually like and the series was canceled, so that's why I'm asking people here to help me get my money back. It's not that there were bad episodes of the series, because there were great ones, so I just have to take a real hard look at the show. The show was canceled in 1995 (I can remember being 9 years old at that time) and they're going to release the last season of the last series, so now, a lot of fans are going to ask me if it's really possible to see the show again, and for me personally, I don't feel comfortable doing a movie about it now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the way they wrote the movie; when they were telling their story they wanted to tell about one of the two women. I love how it was, but when they made it I would like to see something more like the way I read it (not as funny or as fast) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think that the people behind this movie can do something with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing this one for two years after hearing about it, and now I have seen the film, there are a few good jokes about the "Little Tokyo Gang" (I.E. the Gangsters), and I think the film is still funny, I think it is more important for people to have fun with the film than to be able to laugh at the characters, which I think they are playing the parts of a total dolt in the whole film. Even after years of working in Hollywood, I have never seen such horrible acting and terrible acting, it is horrible.  The film itself has a bit of "filler", which is just like when you see this in the UK, you can get that kind of filler. The film could be a funny flick. I would recommend a real horror film, this is not a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I would be interested in seeing this movie is if it was in the middle of the night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what happens when a bunch of talented, young, and beautiful young women try to make a movie. They're not just actresses, they're performers. And that means they have to find someone to play the lead role, which of course is the main attraction of the film. I'm not going to ruin it for you by telling you what happened because that's a big part of the story and something I'm sure people would be very interested in seeing. I'd have to say that they have good things to say about the director and it wasn't just this one or that one or when they were young. I think they'd have more luck finding an actor who is willing to do this type of work and there was a time when they had a lot of success.  The actors are either really good or really bad. They've made me laugh, they've made people angry, and they've been really good with their roles. But they've all but ignored the leading role and there are no real reasons given why.   The movie was over-rated, extremely bad, a total waste of my time, I did not like it at all, the ending alone was truly awful, and I have absolutely no clue why the filmmakers tried to remake it in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the great things about movies is that they are all different. So in the end, it's up to you to decide whether or not this movie was truly made by these two talented, and honest people that I think are truly deserving of such a great,butbutbutBUTbutbut. I have seen a number of these types of movies and have loved them for all types of reasons. So I don't think that this movie is for me or other types of movie lovers who do not feel like they are in control of the outcome of this film. In fact, it was all the more so disappointing and awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that kept me awake during this entire film was watching the first 30 minutes. The only reason I watched this movie was because it was an hour long (I just happened to have a spare 30 min), and I figured that my time would be better spent. I do enjoy the first three episodes of LOST (which I thought were pretty good), and when I saw those, I had the feeling that the writers were pretty well versed in the character's history, having just spent so much time with them in the first season of LOVING END, and that I thought they were going to delve into this and explore the characters' pasts (for example, the show, for the writers, would have had the opportunity to do this). In addition to the first hour, I actually enjoyed the first few minutes of "The Constant Gardner", when we saw the cast (and the show was much more "real", or, at least, less "fantasy" in that respect) exploring their lives on screen. I enjoyed that. When the show premiered, this is what I was hoping to see, because it would have been an hour-long film that followed the characters as they went through their everyday lives, and the characters would have the opportunity (or would have to be really good actors, since "The Cusack Sisters" were pretty much just good actors) to have done this. After the first episode, I would have liked to have seen a little bit of the "Constant Gardner" series, and some of the scenes with the sisters, just to get a glimpse of these characters' lives. We are left with this film, which tells the story of our characters in their bedrooms, where we never see the sisters. "Concordia" is a love story, not a romance (this is not really fair, of course, because I don't feel like I have to go on a long "love story" essay to prove that these two girls are in love with each other, and they are). As such, if you don't like it, you are left wondering why, even though the writing is fantastic and the cinematography is quite good, why this is the movie that you will have been able to see. What I'm left with in this film is what you might have seen in "The LOST Girls", with the very beautiful and talented actresses, and I will say that I do think the characters were pretty pretty, and very
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie was a better time because the first movie was called "Voyage of the U.S. Alaska" and that movie was based on the ship itself. It was the same time of year and I think it was a lot of the same people who worked there and I do wish it was true that the sequel would be based on my experiences in Alaska... It really is too bad because it would have made me a better person and would have helped me understand the situation better. I didn't even know that the ship was decommissioned because I was on board during the first voyage and I didn´t know that it was decomissioned until my friend told me about it when he had his job on board.  I really can´t imagine why the people that were on this ship and my own friends that were onboard really cared for the fate of these people, and I was never given a reason why I had to sit on the boat and make decisions that involved my own personal opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found that the movie was like an 80's movie. I thought that I was watching a sequel to "Return of the Jedi," or a movie that would be on video, since the ending of "The Empire Strikes Back" is still in tact. I found out that a new "Star Wars" movie would come out about six months later on June 8, 2005, and that "Return Of The Jedi" was in circulation as "Empire" the film would have been "Star" for "Empires." I found this new movie to be a "lost treasure." The DVD is the movie that they gave us when I bought the "Star Tours" DVD, and I would give it the same rating, or more. I can't say that it's worth buying for a nostalgic film buff. I'm sure that George Lucas would appreciate you buying it for him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is very low budget and is pretty obviously based on a book. I think they were trying to do something like a remake of "An American in Paris", which is an extremely obscure book, so that was pretty funny.  I was surprised at the number of people who seem to think that "Le Coupré" is an innocent book.  The French people do not take kindly to their fellow citizens being portrayed as a weak character, or as a character that is the product of some naive American movie-makers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw the "L.A.T.S. (L.I.T.)" film in late summer, and I can honestly say that this was the worst movie that I've seen from the "original" "L." "L" was good for its originality of being the "ultimate" movie. It was the ultimate movie because the first two "L's" were a documentary film, and they were "The Ultimate Documentary." This movie had no originality whatsoever, or any connection to the original "L," and really it's hard to believe that there's any resemblance whatsoever to the true story behind the "unbelievable" film. I would never recommend this film to anyone, and anyone who's watching it, or who wants to be a part of any film made on this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't tell how many times I've seen it. This is probably the last time I see it. If you have any clue about this movie, I can honestly say it's a complete waste of time. If the only reason you want to see it is to see a good film, don't even bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film at the Cineplex, and that was the movie theater.  This film was shot in Vancouver, Canada, where the film industry is based, which means that it is being released into the hands of film studios, who are now also being represented by the Cinerama section of the video store, which is like a second-class citizen of the film world, a world full of the negative reviews I've read of it, some of which had already been released.  It is important to understand that there is still a huge section of Canada's population that is still in the middle of Canada, in the lower levels of society (i.e. a lot of families), and who will be watching this film. I'm curious as to how much of this film was directed and filmed in Vancouver (because there are still plenty of Canadians who have made and are still making films in the film business), and to learn more about this world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made to make an impression on the jury in San Francisco. What this film tries to do is be the best it can be.  There were other film-makers doing a project of this kind, and they were trying to make a movie for a public screening.   The Jury found "The Jury" to be the most boring piece of work ever put on film, "The Best" is not only the best but it was the only film I've seen this year that I would say was "The best". That was "Dance With Me", a real film. I'd call this a real disaster, with a bunch of movie-makers trying to take the same movie that we made for "The Final Cut", an action-film that's trying to be as big as an action thriller.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did watch the movie "The Last Days of the Moon" and enjoyed the first 45 minutes of that film. There was a great space station and some of the "Space Cadet" movies, such as "The Day the Earth Stood Still".  The last 15 years, there have been more movies starring the astronauts and I think they deserve some credit for their role in the movies. I just don't have the same feeling as I did in "The Moon and the Stars".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to watch a show about how this might change the world for all of us in the west and perhaps find that a story was telling about something else. There were two episodes of the TV show in particular that I liked and one was the final episode of the show. I remember liking that finale. I thought it was one of the best endings for the show and had a twist ending. And it was all in the world right at the end of the episode. If you haven't watched it, the last episode is available on the DVD.  This show was supposed to be about "The Truth" and not about truth and lies. I had seen some reviews about how they wanted to cover all the truth and give the viewers what they wanted. The end of episode two was about the world. It ends right there with the words "I'm sorry".  This movie is about the same thing. This world is a world of ignorance and lies and stupidity, and I know that in my life I've had many of my friends and fellow humans who've had their lives ruined due to ignorance and stupidity. I don't feel that the filmmakers were able to convince the audience that anyone cares about them, or what the movie is trying to do is make people care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember this being the biggest, the greatest, the best of all that time, with the exception of the fact that I was 15 and had a 15-year-old boy crush on this guy. In a movie called 'Mystery Men' starring Dan Hall, that is what I see myself in, because I am hoping it will be funny and not so serious. It's not that this movie needs comedy. There are some great guys who have done it before in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" series.  This is the story of a man and his son, who are just told the story and it all ends with the kid dying and he can't get revenge. We need to see the movie and know what we are getting into before we watch the movie, because right now the guy is being hunted.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the first DVD of this movie, a very cheesy video that was just a bunch of people screaming. The second DVD has more than 3 hours of "widescreen" video,but it still isn't all that great either. The DVD box has "Direction from the Director" on it, and it is all in German, and the DVD cover has the "Drama" section on it. In the "drama" part of the DVD, you have an English subtitle that reads something like "The Art of Story" - I am not sure whether it is a German movie or a German film. It could be confusing. The art is beautiful, and if you are more familiar with the film and its German original, you will find it.  In "Dance with the Phoenix", a German cover was used.  This is one of the best covers of the film. Unfortunately, you don't get the same "full-screen" or "wider-screen aspect" for the DVD box.   This movie has one cover that was released in Germany, a big "B" print (in German), and there are no German subtitles, which means that it is not "Worth" the money you are likely spending on it right now. The cover has a cover that tells you exactly what you are buying, and that covers the movie "Toten Teufel". This is the first film, and you can get an English DVD in Germany. You get the German cover (the one in the box).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found that the film was made in Japan, as was the original film. And I didn't like it. As soon as you're in a place where there are a lot of people, or the camera is moving around and you can look at things that way, or there is enough time, there is no better way of portraying the idea of being lonely. It's a depressing thing that happens, and it was made for a reason.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts with a scene on a bridge, where two guys (the lead actors) talk about the movie, and the leads (two young men) are seen hanging around the bridge in the movie. The movie is like a one-room museum.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To those who are familiar with the series, I don't think you will notice much, at least initially. The first time I watched this, I was just trying to get some context on how this was all supposed to work and how it would all be brought together. In that first movie, I didn't even know what the hell was going on. This second movie really tries to cram everything in just in time for the big premiere. And since it's a really important movie, which is the one that people are expecting, it's not really feasible for the movie to go on indefinitely. The producers will need to make changes, or do a sequel in some way, and we will continue to provide more information in regards to that. In the meantime, there's the next one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a number of independent films, some of which were made a decade or more ago, and some of those I found quite interesting. I thought I'd be in for a few hours of film, a film with some big name stars, maybe a Hollywood title at the end of the credits, a big director with an exciting plot and a good story to go with it would be a director of the caliber of Martin Scorsese or Peter Weir or some other big name director. If you get a chance to see this, you know that you're in for an expensive one. If not, the film is not "mature". For some reason it seemed the people who made the film were more familiar with movies like "The Third Man", or "The Deer Hunter" and were looking for the "Americanized" film. They were also interested in the period, period detail, and so forth. The period is what has been told in the book, with the exception of a scene in the basement where a young man who had been murdered by Jack the Ripper's wife comes back and the young woman who played Mary Todd Lincoln's mother-in-law (that scene was actually shot with a camera that was made with the same camera company as the one used by Universal and Universal Classics). The film does not have any real historical or archeological background, and the movie has "tried" to give some historical details about it in the back of the book and the credits of the movie, which is an entirely different film entirely. The back of my book has a little bit of the history of the war, some historical references of the era, and "The American Girl" tells the story of an actual girl in the attic (i.e., Mary Todd's father). I have the actual film's complete history of this movie.   There are two scenes with actual historians in the house, one for the back cover of the novel, the other for the credits. I found these scenes to be quite interesting and very helpful. It's not like the people working on this film are complete historians themselves. I've heard and read some pretty negative reviews about the film.  I think they're both wrong about this film. In the basement scene, I did have to do some research on what some of the American troops did for a living at the time. The film is about Mary Todd and her life, and she was killed in her bed by the hands of her lover

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the film premiered on June 11th (the date when the film was filmed), I had just read about the film's success on the Oprah Winfrey Show. I hadn't seen it. The movie was released on DVD on July 12th and was available to view. My own view is that I have seen the DVD cover for a long time, and have no doubt seen a lot of documentaries. If you have seen any of them, you would notice how often they take a look at it from the cover. I'm not one to be critical of my own film, because there is a lot to like. This was released by Fox Television, one of their corporate divisions, in the United States. And, as you may recall, I think it was a lot better than some of their other programming.  As it turns out, I am not alone. This is a problem that has been with the movie, and will continue to be with it for a couple years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this film when it came out. I think the film was really funny. You have to remember that this film is a comedy.  I'm also not the only one who was really offended by the movie. In fact, a lot of people from different countries around the world, especially the USA, didn't understand it. This is the first movie of the two, and in Japan, this is the second film. I'm actually really surprised that they did it. And I hope that they make the second one the funnier, because in the end, it's the American film that makes it funny, and this one didn't make me laugh in the least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a fan of Stanley Kubrick's work for about 10 years.  This is my second attempt to see the film, and I thought I was prepared to see this one of my friends (for example) see it. I was really looking forward to seeing Stanley Kubrick and the people that worked on the film again. It was something I was looking forward on seeing because he was a very important figure in the world of cinema.  There were a lot of people that were very upset about this film and I think that we all are disappointed. This is a very horrible film, not even the most horrific of films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still not sure if it's a remake or an all-time, and I really don't know anything about the characters. All they do is tell you about how they got to America and they talk to you about their feelings for each other, what I find is that they talk about how their feelings are hurt for having to lose their mother to the war, and how they are happy to be living in America because it is not true to what happens in the war. If you see the war in the film you will see the loss of family and the pain of seeing their dead mother in the house. The war and the loss was never forgotten, and they lived with it very clearly in this film. The only difference is that, in the book, the women were portrayed as not having the same feelings. Maybe you want to know more about how the war affected them. You will see that it's the exact opposite. I don't see how they could really justify putting this movie out with a full rating, because this movie is a war movie not a true war story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do not believe the producers of this movie to believe in their God. They need to leave the God-centered town. I am ashamed to be a part of this town. There is nothing redeeming in it. It is a disgrace and an embarrassment to be filmed in a town where I was invited to participate in this film. I have been through life and watched the best of my friends do it. They are the best actors, directors and I will remember them forever. It was not like the producers wanted to embarrass themselves. I can tell you this: The only thing that will save this movie is to have me and the rest of the actors in their town on the other side of town and see the best they have to offer to save it.

I do enjoy comedy and do not want to see this movie, like most of my friends have reviewed here. If you are looking for something completely different I do recommend you take a shot at it. I will take it this is a good laugh and I'll try to find it but this movie was a disaster from the start and I don't recommend this movie. I mean, the acting was fine, it's the direction that kept it moving. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, after seeing "Dinosaur Rex", and after reading the book I found out that this movie is on the other side of the fence.  So, as if the movie is supposed to be a documentary on a certain theme, we're talking about the movie "The Great Dinosaur Mystery of the World".  And, when you're talking on the telephone with a fellow movie-goer, don't give them the impression that it's some epic, blockbuster movie.  The movie was filmed in 2002, so don't think that it could have been better at the time of production.  A lot of time has passed since the time the book was published. I can tell you, after having been a regular customer for about a year at the movie store in my hometown of Cincinnati, it was the best-selling movie in the whole theater in the local video store.butbut the movie itself is far less impressive than its predecessor.  I think there's a lot to be said about "making a good movie" and I'm glad that we can get the movie out there again.  If you haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and read it and compare the two movies side by side. In "Dinosaurs: A Definitive Natural History" the dinosaurs in this movie were absolutely amazing and beautiful and looked very close to the real thing, although in this version, they're a bit more grey, more prehistoric, and don't have the same jaw shapes that the real dinosaurs had.  It's not as bad a ripoff of the book.

So I bought it, hoping that it would be better than "Citizen Kane" (1941) because it's the only one out there in the US and maybe I would see that movie at the Museum of Modern Art (where I saw that movie in 2006) and I had low expectations.

I tried to think of something funny, and even laughed at some of the other movies that I've seen, because they're not really comedy. It was pretty bad, and I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My guess was that I'd be able to see the movie after it finished its run on TBS, which is in fact the case. The movie was a poor attempt to make it to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got back from Ireland. It was interesting to see Irish people, who have a connection with it. I was interested to see the relationship between Richard Burton and Michael York, who were friends in Dublin. The movie was filmed during the summer of 1938 and was directed by Tom Stoppard (a director who was also known as an Irish actor, who did a lot of low budget horror films).  Richard Burton was not quite an actor, and was given the role of "Richard" (his birth name) in the film.  His character in the movie is a bit silly and a bit of a "joker" and is not "rich". This is not the only reason why I didn't get along with the role. The film had an attempt at humor at the end with Richard sitting with the film director in a London coffee house and sitting on his lap.    Burton was about to start "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (the 1931 film, which he starred in) and he was also a very poor actor (although he was just 20 years old). The character of Richard has a lot in common with "Hannibal Lecter", in that they both have a good, "rich" head of hair, which is covered by the wig and is bald. Burton's head is also not "full" and he is very thin.  I have long hair, and I am 5 foot 6 and weigh about 105 lbs. My head is just not tall enough for him. I have been told that Burton was too old for the part, and that he was "small" for the role (like as being a "tiny guy"). This is true, he is not a "small guy" and I was about 20 or 21 at the time, and Burton has been in a lot more than just horror films. He had his own production company, which produced a lot a lot his own works and movies.  The character was based upon a character written by Arthur Schnitzler, and also based upon the character in "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" about a man with the same name and age as "Cannibal Hannibal Lecter". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was filmed in 1979. It was released in 1992.   It's really embarrassing to watch it. The story is weak, there's not much of interest to the movie, it's a very bad remake of the original "Planet Of The Apes." It really seems to be a new idea that someone just came up with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm old. I can't act. I'm not very good, and I think people think that I'm this great actress that they've come across in other movies. My acting is terrible, and you're going to hate me, I'm the only person who should be in the movie. I don't know why they made this film, and that was my reaction to seeing it, and then when I think about it, they should just remake it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just a horrible horror movie that should be at least a PG-13 movie. I gave this movie a very high rating because I was looking forward to this film being good and I was going to rent this movie from my friend who was going on a trip to California.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To me, this was a bad, bad, terrible movie. The good people of this world were able to help me watch this, so I thank them. Please, please remember this movie, because it's about a girl named Grace, who's family is from France.  I don't want you to waste your money on this horrible movie, or watch it, in its entirety, on television. Please. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the "Saving Grace" television program that ended up on a TV station in the southern hemisphere.  I liked those shows. I watched "Last Tango in Paris" and was really glad that I was able to watch it during its original run on TV. It was a great show. The director, writer and actors were terrific.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbuttwhen they started this show, my god. What a disaster it is. How do they make people do this. If they had a real sense of humor, they'd laugh. This is a bad comedy and a dumb comedy. Don't get me wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the most beautiful people to be found, and to this day lives in a country which is governed by the same kind of man who was murdered in that country, and has a long beard.  I guess one could say that he had some kind of "opposition" to a man who just happens to have a beard. In the real world, most people would still be under the "oppression" of being governed by those with beards, and beards are considered a "social" disease, not an "art" disease or "spiritual" disease. Even though the real-world situation could have been very similar, in real-life the man who I'm about to interview (the subject of this story) was murdered. And I think there is a difference between a real and a fictional situation. And since this movie is fictional, I don't know if I'll get the right "view" of what it is all about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first attempt at a horror flick. I have seen it twice now and was not disappointed by the first. As of now, "The Scream" is a real garbage movie. I mean REALLY. Don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the things I was hoping for was a "Diary of a true" movie. A guy who actually grew up in that town. He was a real estate developer in the '80s and '90s. He wasn't involved with anything remotely like a real-estate business. And to be honest, the DVD cover was so terrible that it actually looked as though it were made. I wouldn't say the movie was terrible, but it is really not good and really should be a cult movie in the same vein as "The Hills Have Eyes."  The DVD comes with some extra material and an extra 15 minutes of extra footage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that there are a few others who have had worse luck than I and were in the army, and I know they had their own problems with their respective situations, I am not one of those folks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been watching the film for more than 3 years now, and I can't remember one time when I've walked into the theatre and found something more interesting in the movie. I'm not even joking. I really do think that a movie like this would have a little impact on some of the students in the class. You know, a guy walking in and telling them about the movie "Manos: The Hands of Fate," or something like that. It's a movie that was written and directed to make us laugh, and that's what it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As to the overall film, this is one of the more obscure films. It's been released on DVD, and it's one of a handful of other films in the past few years.  I have no idea if the film has an official distributor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some good stuff in this movie about the late actor Robert Blake (whose career and life was intertwined with Blake's), such as Blake's characterisation of the late Blake as Blake, and some good lines in the movie, and in the end, this movie really doesn't deliver on the screen (to be honest, unless you're just watching it), there's too much to do on the page, and the script is really, really awful.  The first part, there is so much stuff to get into, how could they cover it all, and no movie about a dead guy could ever make that comparison.  It's one of those crappy films that people who are really stupid can say is good and make money off of, where they can see the effects, and it really hurts, in every way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like Robert Blake (the director of The Natural History Museum's movie). In fact Blake was one of my professors when I was an undergraduate in college.  I love Robert Blake. I love the Natural History museum's Natural History of the North series. It's so funny and good. In the Natural Science Museum's series, we have "The Natural History Of The Air" which shows people on the air with their voices. In this movie, all voices but one are heard and only one is in the air. This is not good for a comedy, especially since it was supposed to be a spoof, since it's really like a comedy about a comedy. A lot of people have said that this is the only joke about a real scientist, and I disagree. The director of this film clearly has his own opinion and the movie is actually rather silly and ridiculous. And I think this movie can go to any movie-studio in the world to see the success of the film "The Naked Scientist" which is a hilarious spoof of all movies.   And the Natural Sciences Museum's team and I will submit that this movie is going to be about one of the silliest films ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie I saw was an interview with the guy who directed it. I saw the movie when I went to see a movie at the old location.  I wasn't able to sit down in a real theater. I didn't realize it. At first I was worried about the low-budget production quality and the fact that I was in LA, who knew how much money there was there for me to go out and make a movie.  Well, the production was very amateur, very low budget. There was no real editing or lighting. There were a couple of "special" shots (like a few of those old Hollywood features), the lighting was so cheap and ill-conceived it was embarrassing, and the dialogue was so lame. This movie was a rip-off. The director should have left it alone and went to try to make something good in the movie theaters, like a "B" film. The end result is a pathetic, poorly made movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did the movie because I am an "expert" in "reality" and this movie was not even good enough for a couple of things, including one scene (although I didn't get to see it). In another scene I thought a guy would be killed, and he ended up on a bike. (Although that may have been my imagination). I'm pretty sure my daughter was the only person in the theater, who liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a dumb movie, about a dumb actor. No plot, no development, no nothing! The movie is full of cheap and vulgar humor that makes me embarrassed for all of the cast members, for every moment they were in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a straight man, you might think that I was completely crazy.  I mean, it was a movie from the 50's or 60's. How do you expect it to be more offensive than that? I'd like to make my peace with the rest of the world and have a decent movie in this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to a screening of the film that was made in 1990, and the film was titled "Citizen Kane," the only way I could find it to get the whole thing was to get it edited by the makers of "Unforgotten."  I'm glad that the movie is released as part of a series or I'd like to be able to watch the whole film. Also, I've been a fan of "Cary Grant" since I was a kid, so I really wanted to see how the new director handles "Cockney." That's my hope in going to the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really good for the original 'Stir Of Joy' movie. That's not a long movie. This was really bad. It's got to do with the fact that it had to be shown as an afterthought in the end. If you want to see this, it should have been shown as such on DVD. I recommend 'Stick' as a companion piece to this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really know why they chose to do this to the public, because the movie is about a bunch of bad guys.  It's about an anti-hero who kills criminals, makes up for his sins and is willing to lay down his life to protect his friends from bad guys who want to destroy anyone who is a good guy, bad guys are just people, people who think that they know more than everyone else. I think that if this movie was made by someone who was just out of school, who hadn't spent more than two hours per week in prison, I wouldn't waste my time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to a movie with Robert DeNiro from a year or two ago, and it was fun to have DeNio around. I had just seen the great DeNido "Krinkle Krinkle" (1944), and I had seen DeNario in his earlier DeNino DeNis. DeNico was a great actor in his DeNion DeNes. He was great in DeNii DeNos DeNie and I knew he could do a decent job in a "Dewey" role. The DeNies DeNicolos DeNiclos DeNina were horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you liked the original one, this was good. I thought it was worth spending three hours watching a good movie.   I loved "Tomb Raider" and was very excited to see more of Lara Croft. It was really awesome and had amazing special effects.  It is a shame that it wasn't so good for some reason. This was not a movie for horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie, I'm afraid I was one of the lucky ones that saw the film in it's original English format.  This movie was made in the year 2000, which is 20 years after the events of the first film, and it was released on video in 2000, so it was distributed in the US, Canada, and the UK.  That means that it was not shot in the USA, and did not have the funding to be shot in a USA setting, and was filmed in a UK setting (not the USA), and the same applies to the music in this movie. Because of this, it's impossible to judge the quality of the music, and I don't recommend anyone to see this movie unless they're on an adventure or something of that nature. It's truly dreadful and should have no place in anyone's filmography. I gave it a rating of two stars because it had a really poor script that got even worse with the movie. It seems a lot of people think that this movie was bad because it was "made by a bunch of hippies". I just didn't care enough to sit down and watch it. I think I found the director's name and watched the entire movie, and found him to be the "boss of" the movie... not the boss of this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have nothing against the "film industry" or its ability to produce a good film with great actors, the "documentary" industry seems to have some sort of "cinema bible" for film making (which was released in 2002). If you want to follow the documentary to its end, it will be all right and will include some sort or "guidebook" of sorts.  In the meantime, it is up to each individual to read the documentary for themselves and decide if they should bother watching this particular piece of film or not. This film is not meant to be for anyone to watch and digest all at once. It's not meant for anyone with a heart for the lives of people in Third World countries, which is what the people of the Third World should be learning from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so awful I am amazed. I do not even like horror. It is so ridiculous. I am a die-hard horror fanatic. I want to watch the movie again and try to save my money for a rental or buy. This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It doesn't really have any redeeming value in that department. It could have been worse. The movie itself is so horrible. I don't know if it is just my camera or the movie itself, or if there were other special effects that were used, or some kind of special effect which I missed, it is like a piece of crap. If you know anything about the movie it should be called "Cinemax Movie" or "Cynical Movie". It is bad at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Virtuosity" is a real word to this movie. The only reason this movie got made was because of its production company, who got a chance to make this mess. The "movie" itself is probably an 8 out of 10. (The box cover for this movie.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about six people and it isn't supposed to be a comedy. This movie was just plain awful. The movie has a bad girl, bad guy, dumb people, dumb women, dumb guy, bad guys, stupid people.   I mean the movie just has nothing to do with a comedy or anything that is not about a good story or a good plot. I thought that this movie would be the same way like this one had to be an 80-min comedy and I thought the movie would just be a little boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is "very" low budget at the time of the release, and the cinematographer for "Alvin". Although the movie does include some pretty cool stuff from "Alvina", and the director did hire some "fine" actors, this movie had to do with its own budget and a pretty hard task, so the film had to take on that challenge. I would have expected "Al" or "CJ" to make another "Albino" rip-off. It really took some courage to see this movie in theaters and to find it worth seeing. It didn't have the "full" cast of Alvin (which was a pretty heavy cast overall and had really good acting, I hope), and the "Al-Tahr" was actually pretty decent (it had a pretty decent performance in "Allegro" which was not a "full Alvin"). So if you like that movie, I would encourage you to go see it, and if not, I feel bad for you (no pun intended) to go out and see this. I hope the director gets the "Sight" of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the reasons for me to do the film was the idea that it would help me understand and become an expert in the film.

If you think that you can laugh and enjoy yourself on this film, you won�t like it...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really bad movie. It's really funny and there are some people that actually do this film. They're the type of people that have an idea of what they're doing. And the comedy is really funny. It has a great ending. But the movie itself is a little cheesy and really takes away from the point of the movie which is to say a comedy. This really is a comedy for two reasons: 1. It goes into this stupid part where they just sit around and have some stupid dialogs and that's about the end of it, it's a two hour movie. 2. It doesn't have a great cast. I mean, not as bad as some of the crap that Hollywood puts out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read some of the reviews for this film, and I had heard from other people that this was a serious film about suicide, and had been really affected by such movies. I had the chance to go out with friends, and we went out for dinner, and there was a few kids there, so it was one of the last times we had to go there. It was a Saturday, so I'm sure we were out having fun with friends. We did see the last scene, but they were so cheesy and stupid and just so bad. They make fun of the kids' abilities and abilities and all their accomplishments and such. I guess they all do it, but I have the right to demand that if you are going to be a parent, that you watch this movie, and do not give your kids my kids' life. If you were to watch this on television, I can guarantee it that if there is any justice in the world, that your children would watch this. It just doesn't seem that serious or honest at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about a couple of people who go on a cross-country tour, which I guess is the equivalent of about 2 weeks, or maybe less.   It's just that this was the first time I saw this movie, and it was just one person on a one-day cross-Country road trip, so I was a little used to it. I watched it in a theater with my family, and I still remember it being so disappointing, that I still wanted to rip my eyes out. I don't recommend this movie for any of the family members, especially if you're like me and enjoy reading and thinking critically.

I don  d like ruin a good movie, I have no problem sitting through it. There are worse movies out there, so I suppose I can't really compare it to anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a documentary, and I would expect a film about a murder, or even a TV documentary on a murder or a documentary of the most recent, recent events at the scene. It would be a really interesting film to watch a documentary about the actual crime of the day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like Richard Dimitri, I think he can be funny. He's funny. I think Richard Dimick was funny in the past. You could do a movie like "The Golden Bough," which was about him being the wise sage. Dimick is so stupid, and just doesn't take himself seriously. I don't know what to say about it. It was horrible.  I can't recommend the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two reasons why I thought of it. Firstly, because it is about the film "B" and that it has the same production as "B". Secondly, because in this particular country, it's the only movie out there that is showing a great deal of local content and because of the fact that it's about the history of a country that was in a great position to show their cultural and historical influence - not the only reason they should be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an extremely bad movie, it is a terrible film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how to deal with this movie and it should be titled "THE MOVIE THAT HAPPENED ON THE PROFESSIONAL MISSION".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I remember it, I've seen it several times with a little kid in it. This was originally for children ages 10 to 12. The makers are trying to get some attention by trying to reach out to the public. I'm sure they would have liked to reach into the kids' pockets and find out what they were really thinking, I'm not sure what kind of movie this is or what people will think of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a comedy, and if it made its way onto the "National Lampoon's" show, this is not one of the best of the movies. It's funny and it's true that some people love this type of movie, and it should be funny, and even for the guys at the local bowling alley and bar.  I like to watch my male actors on the "Laugh-In" show with a big grin on their face. I don't want to watch this guy at the bowling alley or bar (I know he's a big actor and probably had a huge beer). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The cast is absolutely ridiculous and you'll never believe that anyone is involved in this thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As bad movie I find myself watching the movie in the hotel, on a couch, on the floor, on and on... this movie's a low-budget horror film, and one that I didn't expect to find this bad.  If you haven't been exposed to the worst film I'll tell you, horror films are low-rent, low-paid productions, and there's really nothing special about it. It doesn't really hold our interest in a movie that's meant to be horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did watch this movie with other people and, since it's so short (it's about 7 minutes long), there's nothing else to say.  It's bad comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The final part of the movie, which was to have been about the last few years, is an oddball film, like the final scene of the first one. That's a crime for two reasons. One, it's a movie about life and tragedy and it's not one that should go out on DVD with the title "The House." Two, what's it about? The whole point of this film is to be about how to be alone. And the end is just some guy sitting in a circle in a strange room with some guys and some girls. He was in a coma after he fell off a cliff in "Dead or Alive" 2, so he can't really act like a man, much less a man in a wheelchair or walk without assistance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not even possible to believe that some people think this is one of the greatest movie of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For those who remember the movie, I will be completely honest, I was really looking forward to this film being made as a tribute to Mr. Kurt Cobain. He would have been 100 years old at that time, so it wasn't a very well thought of movie.  It is hard to see why anyone would watch it. It is as bad as the movie was before, and they must have had a good idea that they would have their movie at the Bakersfield Film Festival, it was supposed to be a tribute. I really wanted to get angry at them, because the whole reason they were filming the film was because of the nostalgia of it, so to have this movie in the theaters was like watching a lost film. The actors are so bad, and I'm a huge Kurt Cobian fan, so of course I think that the whole film was written to be good, because they should have been able to use the knowledge they would get from their research on how to pull off Kurt Cobains character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have already said that I liked and enjoyed the movie. It's in black & white, so there's a perfect explanation. I didn't want to have a movie where it would be impossible to see something like a black & yellow tuxedo. I would have to find a good reason for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't like to see the movie where the story is being told through this documentary style. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of actors who seem to be auditioning for their role. I was very excited to see the first one when I watched this one for a friend who was getting into this movie, and it would be so hard for me to watch this movie. My best guess as to why this movie was a commercial release is because it wasn't a very big budget, which is why they couldn't hire as many actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is actually fairly light on the plot, and it starts with a man's struggle with his conscience about his homosexuality, and the plot is pretty dark in the last half. The movie does have its heart-felt ending, but it's a bit of a letdown, as we all know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be about how the U.S. would use it as a basis for the formation of the United Nations and the actual events of the world. It's a very sad and confusing movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the world of horror, we've seen it all, so it comes as no surprise that the rest of the world's view of this movie would be more like an "adult's film". I was also shocked when I watched this film, with the way it was shot. It was horrible. I can't believe I actually did this. There was a "B" version of this film which I watched, which has an "80's horror feel" to it. "Halloween" is supposed to be an all out horror masterpiece, and the way this film was made, I was like, "I don't want to have a friend go to my home". You really don't need to see this movie to get a laugh or a chuckle, the actors would have the movie on DVD, so just don't waste your time on this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend of mine (and fellow filmmaker) gave me this movie, and I can't figure out why anyone would pay to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not even about a murder that took place in the beginning of this century. This movie revolves around the "Routine of Murder" in which the two main characters murder other people and have no real relationship with one another. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I had to laugh and I'm a big humor guy, I am not a "comedian". I mean it's hard, I think, for me to even go into "comedy". I really don't know why I am making this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a straight line, straight line line, in the desert with nothing new. The whole movie is a bit of a trip into the desert that's made with some really bad actors that should be trying to make the movie for free... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the end, I decided to watch this because a lot of people seemed to have liked it. I didn't want to waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as the film is concerned I do believe it was made for children of all ages and I am not here to disparage this. I know it was filmed in 1990. I'm sure people who were in the "B" (1980) camp would be able to relate. I mean there is nothing new under the sun. There were also some good scenes shot by the great William Daniels, who was the film's editor. I remember seeing him in "The Long Riders" and was very impressed with him in this film, so I was hoping that he was able to finish it and film his scenes in it. It was interesting to see the film through his eyes. It wasn't bad either. He was in the train, the scene where he and Derry are on the track was the last scene that really was shot in the movie, just when he was going to film the scenes for his scenes for "The Man of Bronze", he shot his scenes here, just prior to this film. The only person who I think was in a good place was Jack Cassidy in the scene that was shot for "A Man Called Horse" about him. It is worth noting that the other scenes in the film were shot on the train tracks, and at the end of the film where his scenes were set.  It's interesting to read the reviews about this film and see the things that say it wasn't "good", so I think it might have been more of a "bad review" on their part and he was just getting into the film, if I recall.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge comic book buff and like many others, I'm hoping for a great adaptation of this. A few reviewers seem to think that this is another one of those movies that is in the comic book store for $2 or whatever, and if I was in that store I'd be on the phone to a comic book distributor who says, "Why are you in the store?! "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It could be that they didn't have an opinion about the film and decided to see what was the verdict and go out with friends to say that. It is just so very bad.  I did see one movie in the theater, which was a "film for adults", which I think was a kind of remake.  It's about as good. It's just horrible.  If you liked it, go see it. There's some great, kind of silly movies, like "The Breakfast Club" or "The Smokers Club". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "A" in A-B" is not exactly A-A" or "A-B," and the movie is about a little bit later than the first "B" was.   There are no more "D" in the picture and "D"-B" and "B-B." I really like the story, but the movie itself is pretty bad because the plot goes from bad to good with the bad guy getting away. "B"-B-C" is the most evil-hearted guy ever, and I have to say the "B.C." guy is pretty good as the bad boy, and that's when he's evil. I have no clue why they had a movie about the good guy that's a remake of that bad guy movie. The movie was supposed to be "B."  If they wanted to make a movie out of this movie, it's good to know that it's not going to be a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought "Granada" was in it for the film because it is Spanish film with Spanish actors. I thought it was because of the actors in the film. This is a film made with a Spanish crew and the actors speak Spanish. The director is American and the producer and the editor are American. That was fine. The film is called "Grenada" and the director was probably trying to get around the fact that there is no Granada in Spain. And he did get in touch with the producers in Granada, in the Spanish city of Santiago de Cuba, and they are Spanish Americans, and so they were able to speak Spanish fluently. The actors were born in the U.S. and went to school there. They were English, American and European American. So you can imagine what their backgrounds were like, because this is a Spanish film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found that the story line was so thin, that it could have easily been an hour and a half long.  A movie is not worth even one hour! If you like to rent this movie, do yourself a favor and rent it off of some movie chain, as well.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is so bad that I couldn't believe that it was really the movie that I saw at the screening. It was a horrible ripoff of a movie that was good for all of us. I'm not going to give it any credit whatsoever. I was very excited for the movie, I really think it should have been great, especially with the acting from the actors, the music, etc. I felt sick and I really did enjoy the music from the movie "A Dog's Life".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a surprise to me, that the movie was "banned in the UK for being so disgusting" for the British film (because of the nudity) in the US. Why the heck would you watch this movie, unless you're really, really sick and want to see the actors in their natural attire, I don't recommend it. I think it's an insult to people of the 90's who really enjoyed watching the 'ROCKS AND ROLL' series, and people who enjoy the "ROCK'S AND ROOLL" series, to have this one on TV. It's just so cheesy, and boring, that you won't care, it's just disgusting. The worst part of the whole movie is probably the way you're introduced to the girls, they're walking to their classes, naked, and you don't get a nice view of their breasts.  I have seen some disgusting films, with horrible actors in awful films and that's why I thought this was going to be 'clean' or'sexy'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the first one, and if I was asked what it was like, my answer would be, "Oh, it was a silly movie about a silly guy" (not that silly, actually)  So, I don't want to make this into a review on the first movie, just the title alone makes this movie sound like it is going to be a comedy, or that it is actually going to make fun of my taste. I was really expecting this movie to make a few laughs at my expense. If you look at the IMDb ratings, you'll note that this is one of the lowest rated movies in the IMDB's comedy category, although the ratings have improved since the last time I saw it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a truly terrible movie.  The acting was so poor, there was no energy whatsoever, there were too many characters in one place...  I had to see the first part, which was pretty bad. That's because I didn't have the same level of energy or enthusiasm, and that was a really long movie, and I couldn't sleep in the second part, or in the third or fourth or fifth part. It's a very depressing movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two movies, which were great comedy, the first two of them were actually more than just a comedy. They actually had some serious topics (such as "The Second Coming" and "The End"). It just so happens that this film actually has two parts. If you are a film critic and you think of this as a comedy, you'll hate it because they are completely ridiculous. At all. I don't really care how long this film was going to take, or if I was really in need of any sleep at that time (I really don't think it would make it past my bedroom door.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd never heard of the guy before and was surprised by his name and that he was doing this thing on TBS, I had heard of him from various sources online and even knew he was from some sort of a movie review website and probably was in the same town or at least some time there, so I'm not an idiot, I'm just going by the name, IMDB and the title of this movie. It's a terrible film, not even the worst of the "horror" movies. I can't recommend it and I'm surprised that anyone ever recommended this film to anyone, I wouldn't recommend anything you're watching or watch again. I give this movie 2 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it comes to viewing the film itself (a sort of one hour movie that everyone has access to), it just plain sucks.  The acting of the director doesn't work. This doesn't make sense. The girl is a beautiful young lady, the girl at the beginning is so beautiful and so innocent, in the beginning. It's just a typical girl you find at a shop. The only time I would even like to compare it to the end of her hair (I'm thinking about how I like to look at her in the shop, and when the film opens) is when she's in her school uniform and she's holding a pencil, in which case you'll see her holding a book with a cute face.  I don't understand how you can expect to make a convincing film about a girl who has just turned fourteen, who has already begun school, who's at school age, who, in fact, is just about to enter her second year in secondary school, as it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not even going to get into this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen and enjoyed several "The Ten Commandments" series, and found it enlightening. This is a pretty awful movie, and so bad it is, at the end of the day, as to whether I find the movie amusing or not, I would find it more amusing to watch a stupid "The Godfather," a "The Sopranos," or a stupid, "Lord of the Rings" style movie about the evil King of the North or any other stupid "Lord Of The Rings" movie that was so bad they could not even make it into a "Lord" version. I don't believe it's going to be a good one anyway, I recommend you pass on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Pom Pom" is a funny thing that got everyone excited with a new version of the movie. It's got to be at least fun to watch as a spoof of "Pompom". After the movie ends with "Pomsprum" it's hard to say I'm even a "follower" of this movie, so if you want to see this movie as "Pon-Pom", it's up to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, the movie is just called "Life" without any of the other, more intense titles such as "Life of the Loneliest Man" or "Life in the Middle of the Ocean". In the end, we'll see if any of my friends are as brave as I am in the Ocean, so I recommend getting into that world first before watching the movie, or even worse, watching this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'd say that this movie was not in any way an attempt to be a cult movie, so perhaps there are others out there who have seen this film and found it and felt differently. The only reason I think anyone should really watch this film is if someone were to find it to be an attempt at a science documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is hard to believe that this movie is rated PG. It is PG-13! And if you go to the IMDb, you see a bunch of people with the same rating and the worst movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a fan of the original series and/or the TV miniseries, I recommend you to watch those. I am only a film student, and I have never been involved in a production where I have seen this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is very "hard core" and a big part of that is the fact that I am very short-haired. I've just been given a haircut and am not sure if it is long enough to be seen on screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, I really enjoy and have watched many movies with very dark themes. I can't see how anyone with any common sense can see how a film like this is even remotely watchable. Please don't waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason that I'm writing this is because I want to see for myself.  I don't like to see how movies can be "made" and "made like this", as it is really an amateur attempt at "art". There is no real point in making this movie, it's terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really a horror film, at least in the sense of "how bad things can get".  The main actors, and indeed all the other actors on the film are in London. The majority of the film is filmed in a studio near London and so far it's still the most economical way of making this film. There are only three actors, one of them who has been in a horror movie, who are American. I'm not saying that there won't be any American fans out there because there are so many people, like me, who really want to see these actors in London, they don't have to do anything at all. The whole film is basically shot in London and with the exception of an intermission or two in the city, in the middle of the city.  It's not only a waste of time, it's also pretty damn silly. The film was actually about "B'Nai Shokl". That means "The Great Sphinx", and is about the great Egyptian figure that appears on the reverse side of the Great Pyramid, not the Great Sphynx (the film, which, of course, is about to be released in the US in just a few days). I can't really say that it was just for the sake of fun, but just for "shock value". The movie is about a very talented French actor, so why waste your time on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a bad love story. It is about a guy who falls for a girl that has no interest in him whatsoever, and I think that it is one of the worst love stories ever made. It's just awful, awful, and you can't even feel any kind of connection. I had to keep thinking that the girl was going to make me feel bad, or she was going the whole way through this movie. This is the best movie I saw this summerbut if they just made this movie with the kind of talent and talent that they had then I would have been able to watch it. The director would be embarrassed. I recommend you rent this movie, or if you want to go see it again see this one. I was extremely angry with the guy who rented this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing the movie in the theater with the "Teen Titans" and it being a super hero film starring "Teen Titan" Jason Lee who starred in the original, the Teen Titans were all teenagers. They were all under 20, at least. The original Titans were only teens. "Teen" Titans are under 10. The Titans are all under 12. The team itself seems to have been given the mission to become Titans of the League of Justice which is not to become the Titans of a movie, and it was not meant to be a "Teen Team" to begin with, so there is a major difference in the Titans and the original Teen Titans. It was made for the television show, so in that respect, the original Titans would have been very close to the film's goal, while the movie's goal was to create a movie based on the Teen Titan continuity. That was the purpose of the Titans. The "Teeny Titans" is an unscripted flop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big Robert Altman fan (and for his directing). Robert Altmarts most successful movie, WOWY, is based on Altman's short story of WOW. WOW (which I also saw) has a black woman (Mary) who is the lead character. I don't think it's Altman or Altman, but I'm not an Altman scholar. I'll leave it to some other people to sort out the similarities and differences of this short story to WOW or WOWW, a WOW sequel or a Robert Altmas short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a straight up exploitation film. It does try and present the idea that this movie was made for "art" or some sort of educational film or something like that.  I mean, I have a pretty high opinion of "art", especially at Art House.   So, if you're going to watch this as a film, I wouldn't recommend it. I mean...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure what it says about 'originality' that it did to the original Rocky films when I went to see the sequel, I'll just assume that the people who made it thought that they had somehow discovered something new when they sat down to make this sequel. They don't. They only get a few good reviews that talk about the original films being the greatest of all time. You know what that means. The original Rocky was the pinnacle of the movie business at the time. It was the biggest movie ever made, the biggest boxing movie ever, it was directed, produced, and shot at a time when the world was obsessed with it. And because of that, that's why they were able to get in the theater with a large budget and get such a big box office hit. They were able because they had the ability to reach out to a very wide audience. They had the opportunity to appeal to anyone that was a fan of the genre, and they failed miserably.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm afraid, it's really not that different from the other movie I saw. I'm not going to bore anyone with the details of that movie, but the first one was more of a thriller (even though I think that the first movie was more about a fantasy of the characters), the movie is about a bunch of actors who are not well versed in their lines, and it's difficult to believe that these people will go on to work on a movie that will only be available to people who have made it big. (Seriously, in Hollywood, unless you're really famous or really rich, it would not take a year for you to get the right lines to speak and get a scene set up like that first film was so, really, it was just like the second one.) I would give this movie my highest recommendation to people wanting to see a very, very good comedy about the absurd world of Hollywood because I think it has a great chance of succeeding. But I'm sure it's gonna be pretty hard to come by in this crappy movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For my money, it's a very disappointing film. That's probably what was best of it, the acting, or the look of this film. I don't want to have any sympathy for these two characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a vague feeling that the movie might be about one of the other actors playing a "regular" role, or maybe it would be about a "new" role for some of the main characters. The main reason I have given for this movie being a "true story" is because it deals with the true people of the lives that it is set in. Not the ones in the movie that are actors. We get a "totally different" view of the world. We are treated to a different view of reality. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be the better, or more accurate view of life. We may find that it was a movie with a different point of view, where the main character was actually a complete fool, or we may find some of them in the story and find that the characters in the film were just trying to tell us a story. Maybe it will make more sense for them to try to make sense of their actions than it would for us to try and find the world through the eyes of these actors.  In the end, as the movie progresses, we find out that the "truth" behind the story is far more complicated than the "one true" story that they wanted to present us with. And that's not a bad thing at all. But it would seem as though it was just as bad as some people were expecting. Maybe you'd be interested in it because of the way I did it in the review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame it wasn't a film that would make a statement, but I'm in the minority. Some people who have commented on this film have commented positively about it. I hope they haven't just been influenced by the film, and that it was meant to inspire us, as the film didn't do that for us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just a film. I think it wasn't really that bad. This was just the first movie that I saw on DVD and this movie I watched on VHS for years. It was the first time I saw the "Rising" music. I liked it so much and I didn't want to see it repeated so I went to the VHS shop and bought the "Gemini" music with a bunch of my other friends and they loved it. This time I just wanted to watch the "Citizen Kane" music because I was expecting something like the "Hollywood" and "Sterling" and everything else. I wanted to just rent something else so I could see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie is a bad film no matter what title it is. And when you see it again, you have to say it is a truly awful, horrible piece of trash that it was to create it, horrible and pointless, the worst movie I have ever seen... This movie, on the other hand, is just bad... If you are into this type of garbage, you may like this, because you will see a really good movie with one or two really good, brilliant directors and such movies that this movie is simply about... and if you are a true film buff, you'll love it... A true horror movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I was more of a science fiction and horror fan, and the two are not unrelated to each other, or I wouldn't even call them the same movie, so I think it's just something else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems like the guy with the money who has all the power is always right in this world, but he did get some money and was given $10,000 to distribute the film, so I am assuming that they spent their $50,000 on their own film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As was shown in the beginning of this movie, that it was a horror flick. I had seen the trailer for this movie on a video store shelf. It's really stupid. Not to mention the script. When someone goes into a hotel room, the "guests" come out and make fun of you, and then when you get the room key, you have to play it up and act like you're famous to get a decent hotel room.  The acting wasn't bad, since a lot of the people around me were friends of mine. It was just bad, and the bad film had a great ending. I hope they make up with their DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a romantic comedy, a lot like "My Cousin's Love Story". And it tries to capture the essence of the movie. It's the most "realistic" version of a romantic movie,butbut that is only about 30 minutes of the film's running time. There are only a few other actors in the film (including Robert Stacks) that are actually doing their jobs. You'll see them in the movie "My Life with Ruby" which, despite being quite funny, was filmed by this same director, and it had a cast of about 100 people. In "Mama's Boys" (and this film is based on the first 10 minutes), you'll see some of the other actors, because they were "rehired" to do other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why this movie was made, and it wasn't made for kids, because it contains violence that is intended to hurt someone. When it comes to violence, children can have a great effect in what they can say, if they're taught and are trained on how to make that impact. As a child, when I did research and saw "Little Tree", I saw children who were hurt and murdered. I also saw children made into dolls or muppets, so they could be used to show their hurt and anguish. That was a great example of children expressing their emotions in such a way that they can create an impact on film.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbuttwhen that doesnbutbutthough.butBUTBUTbutBUTyetbutBUTbuttwhen theybutbutalthoughtheybutbutbecausebutbutandbutbutenoughbutbutButbutbutexceptbutbuttheybutbecausetheybutBUTthoughbutbutdespitebutbutthatbutbutnotbutbutsobutbutwhichbutbutwhenbutbutbeforebutbutuntilbutbutunlessbecausebutBUTalthoughbutbutagainbutbutbuttonbutbut BUTbutbutthusbutbutbeenbutbutbarebutbutbothbutbutthanbutbutratherbutbutevenbutbutalbeitbutbutthenbutbutwithoutbutbutthesebutbutthebutbutperhapsbutbutalsobutbutasbutbutifbutbutwhybutbutitbutbutneverbutbuttherebutbutduebutbuttobutbutIbutbutonebutbutthisbutbutstillbutbecausethisbuttheybeenbutBUTsobutbecauseyoubutbutsaidbutbutjustbutbutwithbutbutinbutbutwherebutbutwebutbutcanbutbutknowbutbutpleasebutbuthavebutbutbeganbutbutwelltobuttomakebutbutanbutbutwhatbutbutsincebutbuthowbutbutinsteadbutbutmybutbutbestbutbuttrustbutbutbelievebutbutforbutbutyoubutbecausethatbutBUTButbutBUTnotbutsoandbutbecauseitbutBUTandbutthatbecausebuttheyBUTbutbecauseBUTbutsoBUTbutweBUTbutandbecausebutbecausebecausebutandBUTbuttheysobutBUTbecausebutyouBUTbutthoughbutsobecausebutwhyBUTbutitBUTbutthatBUTbutwhyandbutBUTifbutBUTsincebutBUTwhenbutBUTtheybutyetBUTbutButBUTbutforsobutsoyetbutsoButbutButtherebutBUTwhybutbecausethoughbutBUTagainbutbecause
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is interesting and that's why I would watch the movie. My wife and I watched the movie and found it a bit boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was the biggest fan of John Candy in CandyLand, and so I have watched this movie twice now, and I find John Candy (who wasn't in this movie) to be a much worse actor than John Candy was in his best role. I know Candy really has made movies before, and in this he played a major role as Candy Land's "Mr.Fruits", and this is no different.  This movie was made in the '90s, and they had to have some sort of a commercial break to make it so that I could review it in the film store.  If you like CandyLand or just want a movie that's more serious, this is probably a good film. If you liked this movie, then you won't be able to take it to the cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was completely incoherent from the moment the film opened.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest, the movie does have some beautiful girls in it (it's a nice movie). There are not many other beautiful people in the entire movie.   The rest of the movie is very bleak and very hard-to-watch... I recommend it to people that like to be shocked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was awful at the time and has gotten much worse as the years have gone by, it's only in the best of circumstances. The film was shot in Mexico and in San Francisco, where the Mexican actors were treated with great dignity and respect. They were well treated and only did a little Spanish (they all speak Spanish in Mexico, unlike in California where the actors were only doing a little). But in San Jose, Mexico (where most of the scenes were filmed), the movie was shown on a big screen in a movie theater and was being shown to a crowd of mostly Mexicans, where they were treated inbutbutbutwithbutwith an inferior attitude and treatment.  The reason that I don't feel justified about this movie is because I feel it's "possible" that these things happened. I don. I just don't believe that the people involved in this thing deserved to be treated this way. I was given a copy of this movie in the late 70s and I'm pretty sure I still have the DVD and it is very much worth viewing in the cinema, which was very disturbing and depressing and shocking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some really great actors (including the aforementioned John Lithgow) that should be able to compete with this "movie-within-movie." I'd have to say, however, that if you don't have the most acute brain function, you may be able, as one of the many "actresses" to be found in the country, to understand and comprehend the words spoken by the lead actress. There's also one really great song in the movie (but unfortunately, that one is all the way at the end). If you get the chance to hear the song (if it comes out on DVD), you'll get to listen to that one in the song's video. I'd like to take a shot at singing it, and hope that that song makes it to the big screen (and to be a part of this movie), along with some really bad acting from the lead and (I think) the other two actresses. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie were about a true movie, it would be one of the most epic films of all time. Instead, this movie is so terrible and so awful that it's one of those really bad movies that doesn't deserve to be on the silver screen or even worse than that. You are SO lucky that your kid's doctor was able to watch this and that you can see it for yourself so that you know exactly what they saw and see for yourself. Don't waste any time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the movie since 1982. I have also seen all of the re-runs. I had heard of this movie at one of the Sci Fi conventions and was very excited to see the movie. I was looking forward to watching this movie on an old VHS. I know I can find some old VCR's somewhere.  It was not my worst Sci Fi movie. Some have criticized it, I don't understand how they can point out the SciFi section at IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend told me I should watch this film on a "Discovery" basis and that it would be great to know some of the native people of the rain forest, because that film was really about trying to figure out the mystery of our own existence and the history of the forest. It would seem I am the only one who ever got to see the film. What a mess!  I'm a guy who has some knowledge of film and I'm still able to enjoy film, it wasn't as enjoyable as I expected and I have to say, the best part of the film was the jungle setting, the setting that was so great in "The Jungle Book". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The idea that they were going to put this film on HBO was funny in its simplicity. It was a low budget film that I wanted to be able to get the "good guy" guys. I was really expecting to have an actual HBO channel with the name HBO. This is not a documentary. It's not even about an "documentary" of a true crime case. Its not even an "art film."  I've been a fan of "Lost" since I was 11 years old and am a huge fan of the show and am really hoping that someone else can find a way to salvage something out of this, I was seriously pissed about this film and not only did I not get what I wanted out of it, I would recommend watching this at the same time that "Lost." It really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was shot on location and as such, I cannot help but compare it to all other films. You can find some very decent reviews out there.    The film was made in 1991.  That was more than twenty-five years ago. The main characters were not even "twins". They were one man and one woman. The twins were the main characters of the second film, "The Parent Trap".   As the main character, the twins were supposed to be an example of "twin clones", which were supposedly "born in a laboratory".  I found this film to be a very poor example of science fiction.  The two main plot characters are supposed to play a couple of identical twins in an "Easter Egg". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been a big success on MTV and other networks. The cast hasbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbecause it doesnbutbutandbutbutthere are other factors to be aware of. The music is the one of the reasons to see the movie on the radio. It's been done so often,but the music in this movie is not great. The song "All This" is the last song in the film and it's not really the lead song. That would be "Come Alive" by the late Stevie Nicks. In one scene in the movie, I hear someone say, "I hear Stevie's still around," and I wonder what the song they're talking about.  You can't hear her voice in this scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I see this film I have to admit that it doesn't look like it was made in one week. There are two big factors that contribute to the look of it. The first is the camera, which is really dated. I'm sure the director was trying to keep things modern, especially in the fact that he used a Canon camera. It looks like it came from 1955. I really hope that they don't make the decision to make the film modern. In the end, I think it's going to be quite awful. Even worse than the dreadful 'B' film. It's also not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first hour of this movie was all about the movie being about this movie and about me and the director of the movie. Then after that, you get to see the whole thing and what happens and then the film just seemed so bad... I'm so glad I got to see this thing on video. I mean it's bad that the director and the other guy wanted to make it. They wanted to remake it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a good idea for a few good people. One of the main reasons I watched this movie was because I was a fan of Robert Downey, and the "Man in Black" character played by Downey in the original. Downey was a major presence in the first movie, and he's an even bigger presence now. He's a huge butbutbutbut but Downey doesn't look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of the time I felt like the movie was actually making a statement. So I watched this movie because I was curious and I liked some of the things the movie did with the relationship between these characters. As it turns out it was not that interesting in the end. The plot has no real resolution whatsoever. It's a terrible movie, badly acted, poorly directed and poorly acted in a lot of places. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst of the films.  This film is based on the novel and based on it, and it's being remade, and is going to be remade again in two years' time, so I really don't think people need to go to see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very long-winded film that takes itself way too seriously (like when it tells us about how it's supposed to be a horror film). There's really nothing to recommend this film and, for all intents and purposes, I will never buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Myself and a friend of mine went to see this in the theater (I was the other one). A good number of people were actually going to go out to see it at a big theater. I can only imagine the thousands who saw it on VHS tape. It's just ridiculous... I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It isn't like "A movie about A film about A", since I see "An" and "a" in the title.  This movie is a horror film. It may get more than 10 minutes or so in horror flicks. If the actors were good enough, the horror movie would be a horror comedy, with an 80's spoof/re-enactment of "Scary Movie 3". I just don't think that it was very well received, at least by my wife and my younger daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it hard to understand what was happening. This movie has been made for over a decade by the same writer and director and, in my opinion, should not be considered as the definitive version of the movie. There are many things that could have been covered in this movie that it simply goes on the Internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst movie ever made and possibly one of the worst films ever made. I do not know how the "stars" are making it possible for them to get to this movie. The "stars," in fact, have some sort of connection with the film which can possibly make it more interesting, if there is some sort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had the misfortune of trying to watch this movie with a group of people I've known for awhile. It was the kind of movie you could watch in a movie theater, and that is about all I've been able to do.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really doesn't have much to do with itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been reading about this for days. This is a true disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A woman with a gun (in this movie) in the movie. The woman who was the head of this group went to see a movie called THE VIRGIN WOMAN. There. She is the only woman in this group.  And the group leader, the woman in the group, was not really that great either. Her character was weak, her acting was too weak, she did not really have a true vision of what she wanted, and was too much of a woman's person. She was too emotional and she was too serious and she did everything wrong. A young girl in this film was played by a young girl who went to play in the Little Miss Miracle (LMS), and you could almost tell her heart was in it.  It is a miracle that she actually gets into the Little League, and then she has a little girl come in and play the role.    This movie is just plain bad. This movie will ruin it for any movie that is made after it. You should avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so vague and the characters are so bland. This movie is not for children. My opinion. I'm glad the director's daughter was involved because she did a similar movie. She probably didn't get to see the movie first hand, so I'm sorry for that. Also, when I was a little girl I was in love with this movie. My daughter and I love it, I was really sad to see it on the screen. This was a really bad movie with terrible acting, bad story, terrible acting by the very worst actors ever, terrible direction, and worst ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is not my first rodeo with films that have a more direct approach. The director is, in my opinion, very inexperienced. He is an English major at a small college, which, I guess, is a prerequisite for this movie. If you are familiar with English film and film studies, then you know how to handle these situations.  The film is about to end, and if it makes it to the end, it would be a very weird film. I did not want to have to see it. I was really looking forward to it, especially after reading the review about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do not understand the reasoning behind this film. I'm not interested in wasting another hour watching this film again and again to be honest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It didn't matter how good my director skills are or how much I knew about the plot of "Empire". I found it difficult to make it all real.  I'm not even a big sci-fi fan, I just like the way that the two movies are combined. I think it works for that. This time around, I was just doing it for fun (which may or may not have been the case here) and just decided to watch "Empyreans", in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would say that this is the first movie. It was the first of all. And, there are not many people alive who know the second half of the story. So, they had to do the movie on the fly. And some people might be like, "Okay. They are not really telling this story so much, they are just showing how they went through it in the second movie. This is one of those movies that has to be viewed at least once before it can be considered a good film. But then, there is no way that I could really do it justice with the time they gave me. And there is only one movie that came out at that time and that was "Sleepless in Seattle".  I'm not sure why, or if it was the end result of this movie. There are too many scenes that were just completely unfilmed, or uninteresting. The plot goes on, I am told. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to review the movie a bit more clearly than I've just done this because that movie was so different.  This is a movie about a group of people who are all from the same small town in Georgia. The town itself is a little smaller than I would expect for a small town, so the setting is about two or three times smaller than that of the other movie, and the film also has a similar plot line:  It's all a matter of whether or not these people can become friends. They are being taught by the teachers of this school. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a man who likes to read, and the book is the one I read and loved to read. The movie, by all accounts, starts out by showing the movie in black and white. It isn't until about the last 30 seconds that I realize how bad it is. And I didn't get a chance to write an actual review about the movie, so the only way to judge the movie without my knowledge is if it was just bad or good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been in a bad film, never been bored. It is difficult to describe the feeling. This movie is a total waste of time and it leaves a horrible taste in the mouth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure this will change. And as for the "pornographic" nature of the movie, I'm not sure if it has been released anywhere else in the world, or if the "adult film" rating on IMDb was the only way it was available in the US, so this movie is available in America in some markets.  And it is the only movie for sale in America. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the first season of "S.T.A.K.E." I was so pleased with that show's direction, and it was the second season that I loved and saw very beautifully. In this season, it's about two months before season 4's premiere and I can't believe it. It's like a bad film, and you can't see what's going on, which, when you're watching it, it makes it look like a good one. It is also very difficult to see how to see and comprehend the writing, in which I just tried to read every word for 45 minutes straight. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect to get into this movie, I had heard it was one of those soft PG-13 films, so I was thinking a good laugh would make me smile at the end of it. I just didn't see this funny. I It doesn't seem funny, at all. It has to do with the fact that it's a comedy. If it were just a comedy, it would be like an hour long or two and that's not an hour and a half of comedy. In fact, it's way more than an hour.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I've never seen "K" or "L" and have probably seen plenty of films, which is still one of the most mainstream films around. When it comes to the movie itself, I must admit that the acting is at least somewhat decent.  This is why I say the movie is "M-G-C." There is no one in the whole thing. I recommend seeing this movie as a first-person, and not as a movie to a movie buff. You might get a little thrill or something like a "B" rating on it. It was also made with the purpose of encouraging young people to learn. They are at least trying to make the movie seem interesting, which, to be honest, is at the end of the day, a good way to make people smile. They're trying to bring the film up with good reviews. I must be honest. There is very little humor in the movie. And there is no time to really have a story, so it is really up to the younger generation to make up for it. The kids and teens are at their best when they're laughing, so they are naturally the ones that need to take the story seriously, not to me. They need to look up to older men who have had an incredible life of their own, and they need to learn some of the basic life lessons in life that they would have been able to learn at the beginning of the movie, which were the ones in the first ten minutes of the film, which we don't even get here. It is, without a doubt, a very depressing movie, with very low-budget looks and pretty unrealistic situations. The whole thing is about as true to life as a "Saturday morning cartoon," and that is not exactly a great idea, as if that is even possible to be true, or in any way entertaining. I thought that, for the sake of the story, the movie was supposed to be about the lives of the "Bees" and their experiences on "Hive."  The movie was so disappointing, I actually couldn't watch this movie once, not once. I'd rather watch a lot of "Maze Runner," or "Brave" or any of those "Hollywood" films than this. If you, or your kids, want to see this movie, then you should give it your money's worth, which means paying a couple of bucks to rent it and seeing it at a bargain.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would just like to point out that I wasn't the only person out there to dislike the movie or at least give it low scores.  My rating is an 8 because I liked the first one, my score would have been at least 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen many films in my life and never been disappointed by either watching or watching another film.  When it comes down to what this film is about, if you are looking for something completely different, then there are plenty of movies that come out in the next year or two that will fill your needs. I would recommend trying it out. I didn't really feel that any of the actors really developed or developed the characters we were supposed to be seeing. As well, the film does not actually take place in any real place.  I do not know if I missed something, but this could be considered a real documentary-like film. It was a real shock for me to read the title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was, like any other film, a bunch of unrelated people making fun of people that are very serious and artistic. I just sat through this. I was glad to see the trailer, because I was expecting something with a big cast and a real plot and some actual quality in the film.  I found this film to be very boring. I didn't care about it. I would advise you to watch it without watching it for that reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the people who watched this film last year were right to question the morals of the director, and I agree with them. This movie is pretty heavy handed in the morals, and they don't try to hide it, or hide it from the audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this film on HBO several years ago. It had been a comedy in the style of Monty Python. I am sure that by now, it is well over 100 episodes of something completely different. Perhaps if you find a copy, I will make this request. I was given this DVD box with the impression of some sort of "HBO Classic" series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm pretty sure that if I'd seen this movie in the summer, I would have laughed hysterically at the stupid joke that was a part of this movie. It's about 90 minutes long, and the movie is about 90 percent done. The funny parts are either made up of or the movie really needs to get done as a "movie" before the movie reaches the theater. And if you think that this movie could reach a theater where it would be played for five minutes, the movie isn't even a good joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was 17 years old, I was a fan of the Rocky movies. I loved those films. They had an original trilogy, which I also had on video. I was expecting a classic Rocky adventure, like The Karate Kid, or whatever. I've seen it countless times and loved it. I still have it on DVD. I thought I had the rights to it, which is part of the reason I wanted to buy this movie. I am not that naive. The same thing happened to The Karatech Kid, which was the other one, so don't think this one is going to be the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie twice, I am a huge fan of the first one (The first two films). So I am used to the way movies are made (in Japan). This is the first time I have ever seen a film made for Japanese release. Even the way this movie is put out on the video is in Japanese, not Japanese language, with no subtitles (which are a HUGE giveaway, not the first English dubbed movie). Even more, this movie was originally going to be titled "Kawaii" which was the theme of this movie, a kawaii, cute, pretty, girl-friendly anime. I know that this movie contains a lot of cute stuff, and that many people still like to watch this film. I didn't think that this was going to hurt, because the first two titles had been done in English.) So, you know, you will still watch this movie. I wanted to warn anyone interested in this movie to at least get their hands on a DVD, and not rent this one because it was pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not surprised by the fact that I had to make it to the other side of town. I really wish I could give this movie a good review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it was because I thought it would be like a film that I think there was some great film that was in the 70s or the 90s. A lot of it was released at the same time (i was watching the Criterion edition of the movie). In the original release, The Great Race was a very short film and I think that was because it was actually intended to be shown in front of an audience. That means the audience would have seen the whole thing in one evening or weekend, which I assume would have been a good thing.   This was, for a film directed in the 60s, an absolutely terrible film, worse than one that has no redeeming value. The only thing that saved the film was the amazing editing done by David Niven (who, by the way, I think actually directed the film) I thought Niven directed The Great Races of the 70's and that was really cool and should have been the one saving grace. I was absolutely disgusted by The Great races. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to say that I am a big science fiction buff. I was going to go on an adventure to the Moon to see if it had any resemblance to the real Moon. My expectations were high. I had read all the books, watched the videos, and watched all the reviews. This movie was not well cast. It's not funny, it's not entertaining. The actors are all the same, all in black and white, except for one man, a young Irish actor. The one exception was a man named Aidan Farrell (who played a good guy in the first two movies). This is the most annoying of the bunch.  It's a bad idea to go see it. I would rather take the money back I spent on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first movie, and they used to see a lot of nudity at the end of it. That was pretty gross, as was that of it's last sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I may have a small bit of respect for the guy from the movie because he knows the director's name, I don't really feel the need to comment on his talent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "discovery" is an incredibly poorly-conceived and poorly-researched movie. There are absolutely no indications whatsoever of how this film was supposed to be viewed, and that is what made me decide to rent this one, because to make this movie any good at all would be to rent it and rent the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion is that this is one of the worst movies I've seen. I'd like to see this movie, and to see it, in one form or another. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I can't tell you why this is a comedy, is because it's a comedy.  The funny parts are actually coming out, and there is a reason to believe that the actors would be funny.  "The Great Gazoo" and "The Little Giant" are funny little animated cartoons. My wife and I enjoyed both.  So "Great Gazoo's" and the Little Giant were not made by "Great" Gazoo, and in fact were made a long time ago. There are many other parts in the Great Gazoon that are from that time. There is a song about a new little Great Gazook in the movie, for goodness sake. We can see that the Little Gazoon is new, because "Great Yabba-Dabba" is from a different time. I cannot fathom how they could ever be connected. There was nothing in the film for them to talk about, nothing for them. Even the actors were supposed to be from that period. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second of the two films based on this book. The first one is the movie where there's no plot and no real characters. In that movie the hero had been killed by a crazy killer who'd been released from a mental hospital.  This movie has a lot of characters butbutbutbutthey're mostly just walking around in the same room and talking to each other. As I watch them do the same thing over and over again, I feel the movie is so dull, that even a blind guy can see it. It's not funny, it's not even good for two minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was told that it was a film that was shot in Paris, because that is the city that I live in. I would like to point out that this movie was shot a few blocks away from me (in an alleyway) in Paris.  It is my own opinion, not to bash this movie, that this film was filmed in an American studio in France.  In spite of the fact that a lot of Hollywood stars were involved with this film, who were paid their salaries, the French movie industry in general was not very big, so I am assuming that there were a lot more French actors involved, even though it was still a pretty big production. I am guessing that some of the French actresses are really big stars, with a big star-making career and/or who got very good contracts, and therefore, got more attention, like the likes of Isabelle Adjani, who are more famous than me, and were used to getting paid big bucks, while the same roles were given to the Americans.  The movie industry here is really small, so it's not too big of a problem, either. I know that there are French people who are getting paid more, and are very established here, and can afford better salaries and more opportunities to work, and get more money. They are the ones who would be the first to say that they wanted to be a big name in France, so maybe they are the stars here and are paid more. The French film industry at the present time is not very well known and the French people don't have much knowledge about this particular subject matter, so you don't see very many French people in movie theaters, so there are a lot less chances for them to see French movies. For the majority of the people that have an interest in French films, they go to see "Les Miserables", a few of them go to movies that are made from all the stars and all the big names, and you get to see them in the movies they want to see.  And if they don't, we won't see any French movies for them. And it was not made by a French person! It has nothing to do with France, it's just the American version of a French movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did enjoy watching these old episodes because they were much more humorous in the "Buck Rogers" era. They were made from an hour or two of TV to fill a whole evening show, so there was a lot of time to have a laugh and so I really hope this is not one of those shows, at all, because, from a pure comedy perspective, it would be much funnier to watch the classic episodes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read reviews of people who loved this movie before, or people who thought it would be so great. And I want to be frank with you, I have not laughed in a film, not just at a film in a theater, ever since I rented this movie. It was really strange and bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a very serious person and if I watched this movie, I'm certain it would have been considered a very silly movie. There is no one who can take responsibility for this movie and if you are lucky to have some friends or relatives with you, watch the movie with a friend and hope that they can have some kind of entertainment with it. There isn't enough time for this to be anything other than a very horrible and bizarre movie that was really made to promote and entertain this very young boy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have really really liked "Tetris" since its a video game and I have played it since I was 6 years old. "TETRIS" is another game, not a computer game, and although there is an "on line" version of "Tetris" (tetris.com), it is a very different type of game, like a very low budget, and I'm not sure how the producer figured out how to make me interested in playing it. I mean it's so bad that I'm still playing Tetris on my computer, and after a half hour I'm pretty sure it's not even worth making a movie about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not expecting anything spectacular. I was hoping it might be a comedy, and I had watched a few of the others that were comedies. I really had no idea what I was getting myself into.  I'm going to put it straight, the movie is a 90 minute short (not even in the "best" category, although that was my first guess) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my third attempt at seeing the film. This is the first of the two films that has been shown in my local area, and it's certainly the biggest.  The production quality is as low as it can get, it's all about a lack of the simple joy that comes from simply going out and doing something creative with your own hands. It's a shame really, as the film has a certain allure, as it tries to be a horror film about death, and that could be one of the films that it is supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, what do I have to complain about. It could've had a bit more of a problem, I guess, because it is a movie. What it didn't have was the fact that my local video store, like a hundred other video stores in the country, has this movie on "Widescreen". It's too big for it to fit on one shelf. The director, himself, was very quick to jump to the conclusion that the film would be "4/5" and then try to fit everything into a small frame. This is a true shame, since it isn't exactly a thriller, and the movie just really needs to be released in theaters with a more "moviemaking" (like "The Godfather Part 2") approach. I recommend watching this movie at the local video shop, in "Theaters" (the one the movie's actual title is "Theater of the Mind").

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really love the people who watch the Lord of the Rings movies, I thought the Lord is in the same movie. I was very excited when it was going to be released because I wanted to know what would happen to the lord of the rings after Return of the King. My first reaction is that the new trilogy, the new Lord of The Rings movie is going to have a bit of a shock-fest, because it is going after a couple of years that has been released.  And to be honest, it isn't going to happen, because at the end of the day the Lord's back is in Middle earth, he isn't in a castle or a tower in some place in the desert. I think it is safe to say that I will never, ever see The Lord of Rings again, even if it is available on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband and I actually went and saw the first episode of this series, so we had seen these two actors before, and since they are both very big stars, and the two are in their respective shows, I'm going to guess that it would be very difficult for them to play the parts of actual friends, or even real lovers.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm old and in my mid 40's, and, if anything, this film was written for younger people.   That's because the makers of this film wanted to make it more like a teen film, and the producers wanted to create a'shag film.'   This This! It didn't take long to figure out what went wrong, and I think that it will be much more effective to write something that will encourage people to be honest about their feelings.  In the meantime, I can't recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a completely awful movie with no redeeming value whatsoever. And, as far as I can remember, none of the actors who were in "The Incredible Melting Man" were in this one. It's about time I was in the hospital, so you can guess where I was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My initial thought was, that maybe I'd see this movie at my local film festival, or whatever, or if it would come out in the late summer or fall. I would have to admit that I haven't seen the movie so I'm unsure of what the film was like before, I guess it's possible to find it out.  This is what it is, and the film is not about anything really. I saw it once, and was just curious, so that's about all I can say about it right now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The guy who created the show is no longer working on it. In what is clearly a very small production, this is going to take a considerable amount of time to finish, and I have nothing against a show that needs to be done for a couple months. A couple of weeks of vacation after a couple of years at this rate, is nothing short of absolutely atrocious.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of great films that were directed by great filmmakers (Sicario and Kill List, to name a few), and I've been in the past when I watched the first installment of this film, in which it was supposed to be a sequel of a film that was made about a year ago (Kill List) or a short film made by Michael Mann, which it wasn't even called). The movie is supposed to have a direct sequel to The Girl Who Killed X, which was a horror/thriller movie, and I'm not sure that I'm going to pay the money to see it. The first three are great, and the first and second installments of this movie are great.  If I was like to rent this movie off of Blockbuster, I might give this one a 10.  I had an interview last week with a producer of a good indie movie, which said that he was really happy with the movie because it was an independent film.  As an independent filmmaker, this is my only review about this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the very first picture of this movie. The guy who directed this is from Scotland. As a Scotsman I am still angry at him for the stupid reason that he thought he could direct this movie, he is a Scottish actor with a Scottish accent who can't do an American accent. If you watch the way he's portrayed then you know why people think he could do the role and he can't. I'd suggest you stick with the guy that directed "The Last Picture" about 5 years ago and that's the guy's first movie. And I'm sure he's a better actor than that guy, it was a really crappy remake of that. I'll rate this at 4/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be the best film ever made. It was made to be a "feel good" film. The story is bad. Why did the writer decide to shoot it?  I've seen the film many times on tape, I found out at the screening that I really, really enjoyed it! In the original production, you could tell that it had been shot by another director. I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. I think that there might be a new director here. He or she should have that advantage over me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this film is a bit like The Matrix or a little bit like the "Final Fight" which is a more violent movie. I think I'm right in assuming that the ending will be somewhere near "Last Samurai" which will be the most violent film in the series. This one ended at the beginning when they had a "last shot" fight with their former employer, and was about to shoot the guy who was in the trailer for "The Last Samurai".  What Happened next, I can't say too much about the ending of the film because it wasn't released until after the DVD release. They have a sequel, "Kashin" which has the most complete ending.  I watched the original film, which ends with the film's very violent ending, and didn't know about this sequel until my friends recommended it to me, so I guess it wasn;t a great ending for this movie because I can only presume that the people who made this movie didn't have the same kind of budget they had the first time around. So the ending was not the most interesting, which is what I found to be the case with "Karate Kid". The guy in the end is very similar to the character in the first film and the one at the beach, and it is obvious that they have some similarities in looks. I found the ending to be a bit confusing in the last scene when he is in the hotel with the other guy. What happens when they both get shot, is he's just sitting there, right? This is another fight scene where I didn't fully understand what was going on. In the original, the guy had an extremely good reason to keep going and was going to be killed in the room, because it is obviously a really bad situation for them. They were going to go through the same thing they did with the police officer, which was in their hotel room.    There was also a scene where they're both in the police car with the same guy and they have the two friends (both good guys) sitting in the back seat of the car, but they kill him instead of him trying to kill them. The film is about revenge and the guys in their ending just want to live peacefully. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What can be expected is that this film, probably the only one out there, is going to be on a huge screen. And because of that, it's going to play like a huge, loud, noisy movie, which is going on the same time every day. There is no way to play this film as a leisurely affair. There are movies that are only about 30 minutes long, and you get to see all the people in it and have your own personal time with them.  If you're in the mood for a little relaxing movie or anything, it may be worth trying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like the way this movie was shot, so I would have been very surprised to see the way it ended up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen it a few times over the years, and always found the movie interesting, from the "space cadet" program of the 50's to the original "Starship Troopers" with the great, simple story about an average soldier.  Unfortunately, the direction is more to the effect of taking "Star Wars" movies and "Return of the Jedi". We get the basic idea of the idea, that this film is "about" the adventures of the two heroes, which is a good one. You get to see a "Star Destroyers" ship, which would be a great way to show the two starships. We get to know a bit more about the two heroines. In this one, we get just two of them, the other is a girl in a bikini, which can't be classified as a movie, so she's "out there" in an extremely sexy way (not really "girly") for about a minute, which adds to the film rather nicely. There are some nice scenes of "hiding" or "scouting" or something along those lines, showing off a pair of "space cops" who are either pursuing the girl or a couple of female "police cadets", which is something that would have been shown during the "star wars" movies. And the female trooper is pretty good, especially as a cop.  The guy is totally the "Star Trek" guy. He's pretty good looking (although, not as sexy as the girl). It is a bit embarrassing seeing him in an actual police uniform, even in a uniform that doesn't show much skin, which in a lot of the other pictures is showing his buttocks or his chest and so on). I think I was looking at it at the time of the film. I'll post another review on it.   The "spaceship" pilot is a female (this one), who looks like a man, and she has the look of a "space cop", but, of course, she's really a female. I'm not sure why they changed the character model, or something to that effect. The film makers didn't seem to realize that this was a "comedy", so they had to change a bit the look, and make the girl look more like a male in some of her scenes, which made her seem completely ridiculous, even more so than usual.  It just doesn't help at all to show them as two different women (

The rest of it was pretty much me and my friend. The best part of this movie was when my friend was making fun of the bad movie he made. It was good to make fun of how stupid and terrible this movie is. I didn't really get any laughs from this film at all. There are some scenes that make me laugh in the bad film and some bad scene comedy films. This film made you think that the bad guy is going to be so much better than he is.

It was really weird and not really funny, especially with the girl in the end.  I am giving this movie a 7 because I think it was interesting in that it explored various topics such as science, politics, religion etc.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went and saw this in an over night movie theatre with the expectation of a movie with a budget of 1.75 million dollars and a low budget movie. It was supposed to be a comedy.   As I understand it was one of the funniest movies of the year in this province.but I was still very disappointed. I gave this movie my best shot because this is the first movie that I saw that was being released (I think on TSN), it is still one of my favourites, this movie is probably one of those movies from a small distributor that could never really get it together, the end result is an average comedy. This is definitely a movie that you want to watch if you're looking to see a comedy from an hour and fifteen minutes of my life. It could be good for a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must admit that there are many more women and women-friendly movies than this (such as "The Heart of Gold" about a woman's romance with a man).  As, to the best of my knowledge, was a true love story between two people, even if I was a female or the woman's soul, there is still a significant difference in the way the two characters are treated by the "special" female cast member.  I found it ironic that a woman who had the title of the movie "Woman" was treated like a man in the movie. In other words, the "Man" character was portrayed as being totally at ease with his emotions...  If you want to understand what the heck the "Woman", "Woman-Man" and the "She-Man", or any of the other characters were going through in this movie, see "Woman in Blue" or the "Heart of Gold", for the entire story, and you'll be amazed at the beauty of the filmbutbut then she suddenly becomes a man... and that's really not okay, and not okay at all. I think the way that they treat this movie is the result of a very small group of special female actors, who were given the assignment to portray this movie. The movie is not intended for any special female viewer, I mean ANYONE with a deep understanding of love and how it affects everyone, any man or woman... the movie does nothing to make love to the audience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not the movie where a guy has to go to the bank and get the money for his daughter. There is a reason for that. This film was about the husband and mother of the main cast and some other things.

They decided to spend so much money on this film and then I am left to conclude that they were unable to convince me that I wanted to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a "B" picture (one that wasn't released in "B") and it was about time to go through the whole "B thing." If you're like me and your opinion was pretty well formed about "Toxic Beauty," and about to go and see "Toxicity Beauty," you're a fan of the film, and you probably were able to see and appreciate some of what you've seen, though I had a different perspective than the one I have now about "Pulp Fiction" and I had some issues with that film.  The whole idea of the movie was to show how a girl goes from being very beautiful to being very repulsive. It wasn't supposed to be a study of women who got rid of their own beauty, like a horror movie. If you are a fan or a fan who is into the subject, you know that there's a huge difference between a horror film and a horror story, where you want to see a horror where a girl looks good in black and white and meets her evil end. This movie, at least in the US, was released on VHS tape, and I am a big fan of that type of tape because that's a format that is much easier to sell to the consumer in the "real world," I guess. This was released to VHS (the format that was originally on DVD) and that is where it was sold, so it could be viewed more as a horror "movie" and that was what it was aimed at, which is what it should have been. I didn't like the idea of a girl having a flashback in the flashback part of the horror movie (a la "Rosemary's Baby") and the fact that the character was shown in black clothes that were so close to her underwear and was very revealing, and the idea that she's getting back into her clothes, and if you are one of those guys who loves that type, then I'm sure you'll be looking for it a bit. I can't imagine that many female horror fans would appreciate this aspect of the picture, since it is supposed to show the deterioration of her character. As for the rest of the girls, if you didn't get your hands on this "T" release, it's possible to rent this movie, and it's a very long "B-movie" as it was supposed to look. It's like an hour long or longer, maybe a few more, and as such, you're left
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film, I was a real "geek". I didn't mind if people thought I was nuts or whatever. I didn'st think it would be very important that I knew anything about. I was very into computer games and had my own computer. That was my obsession. It was an adventure.  In fact, my friend's father was a computer nerd, so it was a total shock to me. There is no real connection between the two characters. We're never made friends with anyone, and don't care for the movie, even with our worst friends, because I'd have liked to be involved in it as a participant.

There's no way it's gonna be great, especially with the script, actors, etc. There are a lot of scenes, mainly in the first hour, that were cut, which is a major part of the movie, which was called "A Love Story". This movie has more scenes that were "cut" from the love story, which, if you could call this movie a movie, it's basically a love story movie. (You can find that on the film "Saving Face", as an example). There are some scenes in this movie, such as a kiss between two couples, which are from the end of the love film, which were edited into this movie (I thought about that too, with the characters), which are just as great, if not better, than what you'll find in the end.butbutbutBUTbutbutyet there'sbutbutone scene where a couple were just sitting together, so it's like, a couple scenes, which happen tobutbutthen bebutbutbutt get edited out of the "butbutButbutbutthough" end of them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw it, I thought that "Tyson", "Gabby" and "Sandy", and other familiar names would be in this movie, and that it would be a "big, long-running, real-life drama" that would have all my friends watching it. My husband and I thought Tyson vs. Gabby would be the best fight ever. So, even though we're old-timers, and we know the way "sports" are supposed to be (and I really think that Gabby and I are pretty athletic people), we're paying for this movie. I'm a very small woman, and I'm not a very big guy (I weigh 150 pounds), and I was shocked to see how small my husband was. We're paying to see "The Mighty Gabby Gump", "The Incredible Hulk", "Hulk", "Iron Eagle", "Stinky Face", "Ultimate Warrior", "Big Dog" (all of whom were big men), and when you think that "Gump" is a giant, or that "Hogan" is the strongest man in the world, or "Ultimate" Warrior's a super strong warrior, then see him with a short, petite body that was actually quite funny in his TV show and movies. He is very athletic, but he didn't have a great body. He's 5'2" and 140 pounds, so this is just his size. The way he's built, or his height (I think that's what they said in his casting video), his waist is too high, his neck is too far forward, his chin is way too wide (with his hair just falling on his back), and his hair was probably too long, so he could've looked like one of those tall, athletic, "big hunk" bodybuilders, and his neck was too wide, as well. They should've been in his "DOGS". I think that would've made him look better, too. His hair is not really even up to today's standards, so I don't blame him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to ask my father, and he said it's a little funny, and that's why we decided to make this movie. In the meantime, I can honestly say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. The production quality was just atrocious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the reasons why I was not in high school (at age 12) is because of the way the movie was filmed. I just got a copy and read through the synopsis. I have only seen two movies that were filmed this way, and that was the first movie of the first 100 days. I'm sorry if that has anything to do with the movie's message, but I don't want to give this movie the credit of being a good movie because of its message. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I must admit that I have seen a lot of movies. There's really not much of a problem in that field.   Second, this is not my first film. It's a low budget film, and a lot like a lot many, so I'm not going to be that biased. There is a problem with the movie's title. This is probably a problem for some fans of the movie who thought it would be a real-life true story about a real person, and there is a movie called "Life" in that same vein, which is about an actress.  I would encourage folks to read the book and get a good idea of what happens with the people they love. I am certain that the book was set in the 1940's.  So, for all of you who liked the idea of the book, I think you'll find the movie very similar in its tone, so hopefully that will change in the future.  The movie opens with an almost entirely black cast. I was really excited to see a black female play a part in a horror film, so when I saw the opening credits I was very interested to see who would play a role in this one. It is not the first time a horror movie has been out there, and it's just something I found to be really disappointing, and I believe it's the same in a lot other horror movies. I can't blame the director for this since most of the people who would probably have been willing to work on the movie would have been black. The casting director really wanted to focus on trying to portray the movie as real, and trying to find out what life was like in those days, so she thought of that and was able to get an idea of it, so to that end she could at least be honest with herself.  This is about the only reason I could see it. The other two things that the movie really focuses on is the history of the black community, and its portrayal of some of the early movies of the horror genre, and the history (mostly) of the U.S. military. I don't think it's about racism or anything else, but just trying to present the people and history in the most honest manner possible. For example, when the film was made it was very late, and because of the lack of accurate, or accurate pictures of the South, there were still some things that didn't add up. The Civil War is the Civil War and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie is about a white man, and the second is about two white guys. The movie is really about a black man, so a lot of it is the same old black guy who is on the TV shows, and who has a lot to talk about, but he isn't very well portrayed. He's really kind of bad looking, and I really think he should be the star of the film and have a nice face, or he should really be on TV shows. I would recommend watching it with a good looking black guy in it, and watch it on TV or something. It's probably just a coincidence that the TV series came out the same year that the movie did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really not a comedy at all. The film goes on for an hour and half with these characters sitting around, doing nothing. I was a little concerned about having to make an old lady cry, I would think she'd be more of an old person herself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a good idea to have a talk about the film with Dr. Segal at the National Press Club. He was a great friend of mine, and as a medical journalist, it would have been his honor to discuss the topic at some length.  It seems the producers of the film were so taken by the concept of "The Truth" and wanted to get involved in the production of a doc about a doc, and were so determined to be part of this that they made this film. They wanted to make sure it wasn't a movie about the bad guy who didn't have the courage to tell their story.  The truth is, these guys were so naive that they let their passion for the subject overwhelm them, and we have since become friends and we're all butbutbutbutthey're still out there, trying to learn their lesson. If they're willing to share that with us, we'd love to make their movie. But we need to get them a little more help, and they may have the time to sit down with me in their hometown of Detroit and discuss the issues they were dealing with and what worked andbutbut but they don't have time to do that right now, because they're just too preoccupied with doing their own thing, and that's not what a doc is supposed to be about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started off with the usual anti-videoguists with the same actors playing the anti-movie. We were already familiar with the movie that was called "Nightmare" and we knew what we were dealing with, that is why the director chose to make his film about a "nightmare" in an attempt to convince the public that it is a true horror, that's what makes it look like it did.  We have to assume that the director was aware that there was an established subgenre for the genre of movies titled "Nightmares" and movies with a title like "Night of the Living Dead", that's all it took, "Night Horror" is now what we have to refer to. Of course, this means that the horror genre has been forever and forever altered, just how a horror flick needs to be made in that respect. As I was looking for movies to buy, I saw several horror films that were not in the "VHS" format and the movie theater is a horror movie. We had to watch a horror comedy that was, because that was one of the films that came with the original VHS. Now, what do we do? Well, I don't know. It really doesn't matter because this movie is for the people that want it to be for them, not for those that would just spend an hour and half on it to see a "Hollywood" horror that would be the same kind of movie we watch all the time, and that is something that I won't really try to explain in this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an early version of "H.P.B." That is, a short film about the "Hobgoblins" of the H.P B movie, starring Melvyn Douglas, starring Jack Cassidy, starring Bill Nye, starring George Pal, starring Ted Cassidy.  And to be honest, I was kind of curious, and I had a couple of the other stars in the cast, such as Melvin Douglas.   As the other H.B. movies, the H4 and H5, are just like the other ones in that they are about hobgoblins. The H4 is about the real life, "HOBGOBLIN" and H. P.B., the H5 is about another short. And this one had a budget of $1,000,000. And it was probably just a very short film that had to be made quick. I can't imagine that the filmmakers spent any more than $10,000 on this one. It's not about the characters. It doesn't have an original idea at all! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst part of this movie was when it comes to the acting. I have been watching other comedy movies like "The Hangover Part III" and have been amused by other idiots like Mark Wahlberg and his buddy Steve Carell. In this film, Mark Wagen has to be the only one that makes an appearance in the beginning of the movie. It would appear that every time a character is made fun of, the movie is made into a comedy.  This movie is the worst comedy I've ever seen. The movie is really bad comedy. And Mark Waim is a good actor who can make this movie funny. I wish it could somehow be made funny. It's not worth a rental.

I'm sure I'd like to think that there are some people who would agree with me here. It's just that it was so bad, it was like a bad parody of itself. It was very difficult to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a couple who decide to spend the night at a hotel. The hotel is a former mansion of the Du Pont family. So, this film was made to be a true-to-life story about how a couple spend their night out at a local motel, but is obviously trying to capture the essence of the film. I found this movie to be terribly confusing, disjointed and a complete waste of your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been called a "modern re-telling of the classic". It is a re-dubbing of the movie.  I was actually a fan of the original and liked how the film was a mix of a modern-day version of a movie with a little time machine in it, or an "immortalized" version of that, and I am hoping that someone can find that version, as well. I don't want the world to think that this is an original idea or that this movie was an original film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a tragedy that has occurred to the main character in a way that it has been directed to us. He's not even in the middle of the frame, not to mention the main point.  That aside, it's hard to know whether or not it's good, to say nothing of the actual plot. I'm not trying to be an idiot here. If you go into it's self-indulgent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst thing about this movie is that I am a fan of the original "Aliens" film!  I had never seen this movie until my college roommate rented it on VHS, then watched it with me! This is not only my first encounter with "Alive" but also my second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, let's talk about "The Film" (as it was) which was a movie that I had a chance to see on the big screen. This film was released in 1988, meaning it was made before most of the major Hollywood films released their "The Movie" counterparts. It was released on VHS, a format that was still very common in the early 80's. When it was released, it was a "video" movie (meaning it was still being marketed by a few major video rental companies, like Blockbuster and Video Plus). It still plays the video version of this movie on DVD, so if you happen to have a VHS or DVD copy of this film, chances are it is being distributed by Blockbuster (I have never seen it), so it would not be available in any of the big-name chains or chains that still have major video distribution.  And the fact that it is very likely that they have been re-releasing the "film" from time to time, like a "Special Edition" DVD, means that they would probably have re-released it in a format where it is still technically still a "movie" - which is the case with the "Director's Cut" DVD format for example, so that's what I'm most interested in. I've always been a big fan of the "original" version of "The Goonies" and enjoyed it just as much, and since it was in the "VHS" format, it still had some really odd quirks in terms of the audio and video mixing.  The Goonies was edited from the audio that it was actually shot on, so it had the music playing in the background, on the soundtrack. The Goony sound is often loud and annoying when you watch a video version, and this version, if I remember correctly, was edited to fit it to the video format - hence it being loud. It's a totally different movie - the audio quality is completely different. The "Goonies" was a real movie, and the soundtrack had some of the original, and was composed mostly by Phil Tippett (another director of the movie, who did the music) and his orchestra, so the music is still there.  Another really big difference is that there is no music at all. The soundtrack is now comprised of mostly the audio for "The Original Goonies", which is an awesome soundtrack, filled with music and wonderful songs, so don't worry about that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of actors here, not just the two main leads. As for "the guy" in the second film, he was the director of the film. He directed it in the manner that it was shot. The actors here are, I think, all experienced in film, but they do not come from film school. It's not an insult to the actors here (I've made that mistake), it's just an attempt to make the film a little less ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw the film at the Toronto International Film Festival (as a film, not a stage show), I found myself in awe. There is no movie theater where a production of this magnitude could be produced. What is even more disturbing is that it is a terrible, terrible movie for all the reasons I described above, and the only thing I liked was a little bit about a man and his dog running around the side of the stage. The man has got to be an excellent playwright, which is why this one is all I could do to sit through (I don't really want to get involved in the arguments that this movie could be artful, and I am in no way an expert in the field of movies). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is the real truth about what happened? Why is the filmmaker trying to explain and justify the events of the day? There are very few people who truly understand the day, the people who lived it, or its dark past.  I really wanted to see this movie. It's not bad because the day was so difficult. It was tough. I think I may have cried during the shooting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    To say it all; it's just a bunch of moviegoers watching each other, the director's movie "B" was the most accurate version of his "A", i.e. the movie of "B", he played the part of the scientist as a true scientist.butbutbutBUTbutbut BUT because it's made in England, he thinks that the movie is going to be in the style of the original.

They've been played in the same style as they are played in "A".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really in the mood for this, as well as the other two movies, so I watched the first movie, and the "Fargo" movie. I'm just sad that "Dancing in the Rain" had a more positive review about this movie. It seems like people who had actually seen the film were really into it, and now, looking back on it, it's just sad. I'd rather spend the next hour and a half trying to find something else to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's funny. If you find the old movies funny, and find the new movies funny. What does this movie do? It's pretty, I mean it's pretty good, if you watch "Wag the Dog" and "Hogan's Heroes" for example, they were comedies. "Virgil", the guy from "A Streetcar Named Mooch" is about to be 30. He was a great actor, the guy's a good actor. He's had a few problems in his career that can't be helped by some people, and has to deal with that, and I'm sure some people really wanted him to live forever.  And this movie was "Hollywoodized". I mean, there was a "Vigilante" series, I have never really liked that one, and even though that was a series about an idiot guy, the guys in "Vigil" are supposed to be idiots, and "The Vigilante" is still a series. If "V" is your idea of the kind of stuff you watch, "Vigor" is what you watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the things that I have done for 20 years is to make good movies for people to watch. One of my favorite movies was the film "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" which was about the love and passion between two guys who made movies in Japan (I remember seeing that film in 1980 and I thought it was one of the hottest things out there, and that film was a big hit in Japan.  I did have some people on a Japanese site telling me to do this, and I was kind of surprised because of my age and being an American, who has never really seen Japanese people or their movies, and who doesn't know them, I guess they saw the movie "Blazing Saddles" which did not get very popular in America)  I thought that it was strange to see my name in the movie title, because I have no knowledge of who they were talking about. This is something about my second movie and it would have been in the first film, I'm sorry.

I can't believe the people who thought this movie would be good. I have seen all the other movies, so I can tell you who is in charge here. This movie is pretty awful, it's like a really bad James Bond film, just the way James Bond films are. It's about to be banned from any of the American Film festivals. The movie is also about to get a DVD release in the United Kingdom and Germany.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend of mine who lives in a big city called Baltimore (the real one) told me that this was a low budget movie and that it would be worth watching. This was a big budget movie made in a foreign country, so if you had any knowledge at all about Japanese culture, you would be shocked at how bad of a movie it was. It is the equivalent of a two hour animated film.   I don't blame my friend, because I watched this with my own eyes, and I didn't feel like I was watching a Japanese TV show, so I didn the best impression of the two people I knew who had already seen it. It was funny, and there were some very funny Japanese jokes (mainly directed at the Americans). The Japanese would be very appreciative of the fact that this is now available on DVD, and a "movie" about the Japanese film industry. I will say that the one Japanese film I watched back in the 80's was actually about the business and how it all made sense to me at that time. This is a very terrible attempt to cash in on the hard work that people in Japan do every day in making a great film, and with all of the wasted time that went into this, and the time I wasted with it, I'm glad that the DVD did finally get released. I have to admit, though, that my Japanese friend was so depressed and upset that she was practically shaking at the end, so she was very nice and gentle about it, which would make me very mad! That said, my friend wasn't the only one, but she was the only Japanese who liked it. The other ones all liked it, and it's not like they were all Japanese, so perhaps you guys can take one of those two-hour Japanese films that I'm sorry about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pleasantly surprised by the work done by the late Joan Plummer. We all had just been brought up to the idea that she and Tom were on the same wavelength (though the two did spend some time together in the mid 70's).  The problem is that the film-makers didn't understand why it's okay for one person to be so intense, and I think it would have been easier for them to just accept the fact that the actor was being dramatic--they really needed to understand why she had such an intense, angry expression when she was angry, and why Tom was so emotionbutchered when he had a different expression on his face (i.e., the face of someone who was more relaxed and had just come from his first kiss, which we all know better than anyone).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the way they did a film called "The Naked Truth" with Kurt Russell and Bruce Willis, with the movie "The Last Movie" which had Bruce Willis and another actor, Bruce Dern. This one had Michael Biehn and the other actor. The only thing that made this film worth watching was Bruce Denn's performance. Otherwise, I'm glad you enjoyed "The Nudie" and my "Last Movie" or you could pay me to do this one. I like those two movies, but this is just the sequel to "Last Movies" and it's the one that should have had the title of "The Movie With No Name". It's a real shame because a lot of you really liked the movie, the music, the script. This is a really bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still in school and I'm going through my sophomore year, and if I had to guess, I'd say this is what it was like when I was 11 years old. I'm the only person involved in the movie. I don't really want to think about it, although I wish I had been involved in it and that was the case. It was a horror/thriller, so it should have been very much different, much different than a horror flick, it's just a very low budget horror film with a very terrible script, and I didn't even find the ending to be very funny, the last 30 seconds when the girl escapes the room, and she turns around and turns it into a hilarious movie.  The movie didn't really make much sense. This is what I had read in the script. It's not all the fault of the actors, but a good director should have given it more thought. It really was a pretty good thriller.  I actually did like a few scenes in it-- I'm thinking of the part where you see the two of them on the bus, in the airport, the hotel room, when they're getting on the plane, and all the flashbacks from the girl's point of view-- but the girl gets off the plane and heads back to where the hotel was located, where she meets the hotel maid, who turns her into a ghost and they get to fight for the rest of the movie in the hotel.  This is not the girl who had her on the phone with her, the girl went to the hospital room and killed her mother, and the girl is at the beach, so she had a pretty cool ending with her and a ghost having sex with each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw a really funny video on the AVN website - it wasn't that long (7 min), that one had a little comedy in it, and I thought it was really funny. I think it's one of the more funny movies on this side of the pond. It's just because of the fact that it's about a girl and that the guys weren't involved with this - and the first time they're not involved in a movie, it's a girl who's in the lead.  There were really fun jokes in this moviebutbutwhen you get to the end, you have to just pick a movie that you really enjoy and that's what I ended up doing.but you have people who are going to enjoy it just as much, because butbut there are two things, that's all.  Then you're going to be in shock to see the movie and the ending, because you think that this will be a girl led movie - they thought that this would be the most ridiculous thing in the world and so, they thought - Oh my god, it ended up being a girl's movie - which was so disappointing, and so so much of it was from the end. And it's just a girl, and that was really disappointing, I was expecting a lot from this, and this movie just didn't do anything that I found very good at all. In fact, it felt really fake and fake, because I knew that the movie would probably be very funny - and it's very funny that it was in the beginning - it was just the fact it had the most amount of humor, and the movie was really like a really silly one.  It's not as though I couldn't get a good laugh - I like movies that are just silly - like The Cat In the Hat - I think this is just so bad, and it has a really bad ending and I wish that I could give it a 5 because it would make me really mad to see it. I really hope the ending is good - I've seen a lot of good endings, like the end of "Good Will Hunting", which is about the ending of a great movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a week of trying to get in I finally got a chance to see the film. It was pretty lame. I do not believe I did not get a chance at all, and that is saying something, I thought it would be good, or something that would give me some sort of an opinion of the movie. I would say it is just the first time it came out on video. This is a horror film in the vein of "Criminally Insane". This is not a comedy, which is a comedy. I recommend you give this film the same respect that you would give any of the B-Movies that came out around that time. It is not even the same as "The Grudge".

If you know nothing about this movie you'd have no idea. I found it to be pretty awful. It was horrible, it was bad, it's so bad that it doesn't deserve to be on the DVD. I saw it as a DVD before and I found the movie in the theaters before this and it was terrible and not at all worth it. I'd recommend avoiding this one. I give it a rating of 1 out of 10.

There's a scene where a police detective (I think, and this is the only scene that actually exists, though I can't recall it in detail) has his gun drawn.  I haven't seen any real investigation done, no real solid evidence of any kind, and there's no real, convincing, credible reason to watch this movie.

And I was happy to see the series, a sort of science fiction anthology, because the show was about aliens and science fiction, not a genre show.   This was an extremely terrible movie that only exists on videotape.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The final scene of this film, just like the beginning, is that of a happy ending. In fact, it's the same happy ending that we saw in the beginning!butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbutt.  For whatever reason, this film has gone downhill. I'm not sure why. The original series had "B" for "Boring", "Bravo" for the same kind of movie-going experience. They had a story to tell, an action to do. Now this one is pretty much the type of film that people want to see, and that is a story about a person trying to make their way up. People are very good at seeing characters trying to overcome obstacles, especially when it comes to Hollywood, and I'm willing to bet they want to spend a whole bunch of money to see that type of story, because this was a pretty good effort (it was the very first "Discovery Science Fiction Channel" TV show that was just aired at the tail end of 2001) It shows us the kind of adventures our heroes had in a nutshell: the problems they faced, the situations they overcame. I think the original series was at least at a level that had to deal with people who were different or had a specific purpose in life, and then dealt with a lot more of the moral and political problems we have today. I personally enjoyed the film, with the great "Buddhist" aspect it had. I saw this one just because the "Dolce Vita" show, and enjoyed that, and have even heard a lot of people praise this one. The music is very soothing, and the special effects, while not perfect, are generally pretty good. It's all about the story, so why not make it a good one and just leave the moral issues alone? There was some real substance in the film: the struggle with the character "Gina" for example, or the problems she had with trying to get a college degree. The problem is that the moral concerns were completely removed from this one, because they apparently don't have one. There are some very simple things in the show that are actually done very poorly (like one of the "re-enactments" of the end of the original show), and others with the same level as in the old show (like trying to determine what happens when the "good guys" go to the doctor) with very little real substance. For example, I think

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For starters, I'm not familiar with the show's premise--I have never seen an episode of "Lost." Maybe it's a show of the actors; in which case, I am the first person to say that I might not like them all. The actor for example--Drew Barrymore--I don't like the way she looks, and I don't get that "she's not pretty." She's not exactly ugly--I think she has a good figure--she's just "different."  I don.t like her too. Drew Barrymore's character, for me--and it was only a few episodes-- was a very mysterious character--she was, for lack of a better term, "a character." Drew Barrymores character in this show, on the other hand, is very plain. I thought the show is, by now, already trying to figure out who Drew Barrymun was--maybe they might have used Drew Barrymoore's character as a "model" and had Drew Barrymon look like Drew Barrymoon. I'm willing to bet that it's about the same kind of characters--and so I found it interesting to see how they "rebuilt" Drew's character by making him, in essence, look like a girl. Drew is the one who plays a really important role as the head of the family, and so, that's why I think he should be seen as the main character--with that said, I find the character to be quite boring.   As for the "characters in love," that's what Drew plays in the series, so I think you'd be surprised at how Drew Barry Moon plays Drew. The same thing goes for her father-daughter relationship.  Drew doesn't really have an interesting "voice" (it's very soft, as you can imagine). He also speaks in a "brief" way--he seems to be having fun singing--like she did in "Deadline"--which is a very un-emotional performance. In fact, the show doesn't try to capture the emotions of love at all.

It is only the best of George's talent. If he were cast in the film now I wouldn't be surprised to learn if he was able to carry a film that is still on the cutting room floor. I give it an 8/10 score. That is the best he could have done back in 1980 and what the film needs.

I'm still trying to understand how the producers could have a few more friends in their town. I don't know if they just felt they could or if they had no choice. I really do hope they got a little bit of closure from the other side. You can tell it was a movie made in a small town in the south.

I'm very glad that people have made it big and can be in big Hollywood productions...It makes my job easier.but the thing is, it's very difficult to figure out exactly where this is going. I find it's all in one or two movies, with the same basic idea that you're a "doomed" person, and I think they were trying to do this, so that I could have my movie about what happened. It's not all about this, and this is a very hard subject to delve into. Maybe I would be too harsh, in comparison to other movies (that could be made of it).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the movie I played the main character, "Red Crow". He was a very brave man who fought to free the Native Americans of the north from the British, he even led a group of men to raid the British in the mid 18th century. Red Crow was a big, thick guy with a huge frame. The movie version is shorter and rounder than the book. It was about a third of the size of the book and the movie also had Red Crow and his sidekick "Black Jack" instead of the big, strong man who was portrayed in the book! The movie versions of the Native American characters also had stereotypical "Indian" looks. Red Chief had a white mustache, Red Chief's wife had her hair braided with braids and was wearing a red dress, and Red Chief carried a long gun and his brother wore his hair in dreadlocks. This was a pretty awful, poor excuse for an Indian movie, but I guess it has to be done as I was watching this with my children and they weren't the only ones who thought so. It isn't worth $5 dollars or $10 dollars to be called an Indian comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third installment of the "Man in Black" series, and I just watched it for a couple of hours last night. So, for people who are really into that show, this movie will probably seem to be pretty silly, because it's really all about a person who is the lead in the movie, the "man in black" (B.J. Blazkowicz) and the director, and so it doesn't make much sense to watch this, to say the least.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To those of you who are in the know about "American Horror Story" (which I am, I'm a huge fan), you know exactly what I'm talking about. This "American horror story" is a truebutbutbuthorbut horror anthologybutbutsobad movie. That is why I don't even bother with calling it "American, horror, or horror movie. They'll call it something else like "American film." I think it's a little unfair to call it a "horror movie," as that movie's so good. There were a few scenes in "American Nightmare" that I liked to quote, where the camera came back and looked at the inside of the house for no particular reason, and maybe those scenes can be viewed in their own film. I like the concept behind the filmbutbut the movie itself was bad for a few reasons, first of all, the production didn't really begin with a "film-within-a-film" story, which was supposed to be a new movie to a new generation of fans of the franchise (the kind that might see this film), and it had to fight the typical horror film clichés that were the norm for "American movies" in the 90s, or perhaps a new film, with a fresh idea, plot and style. After "American nightmare," the director had his own personal experience to tell, and to try to make a movie of the life of the killer. If this film had been a movie based on this killer's death (which, given what's out there, a lot of it was, it would have been an excellent one), I would have loved to have seen how it dealt with his feelings of isolation, regret and guilt. In this film, there wasn't enough of the "twist" in it, and that's all I know. The way that the film deals with what is happening in his mind was so interesting.  But in this case, the director really wanted to try and recreate the life, not what happened before. If you're just making a horror film, that's what you have to do, so you see how people actually reacted in his death. The first half was about the killer, trying to recreate his life, the second half was on how he's trying to find himself in the present, or how he tries to make sense of it all.  Now the killer in this film is simply trying to make it all fit into the movie,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the book by Lotte Lemme. I really enjoyed the book, not to mention the director, and the author knew what was happening with the novel.  As far as I'm concerned, the book was the perfect and definitive text on that subject, the novel would have been the first choice for a translation, because it would have taken into consideration the other text, the movie was never translated, and that was the reason for this book. So, the only translation that can be called definitive is the French, which is what was done with this book, and it was also done with the first book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a movie about an old man with Parkinson's disease (for real), and for that matter, there's nothing that looks like an old film (and the last time I saw the title "The Old Man," that film was very much an old movie, and even then, it was a very old film, so this film will be shown on the National Film Preservation Foundation's "Screening Room" which is just a little over two years old, and "Old Man" will be on the video store shelf for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, you're looking at a new, unwieldy home theater camera. This thing is a very strange piece of gear for all purposes, and so much more difficult to use than the old ones, and a far, far tougher film to watch, and it doesn't just have a bad ending, either. There are some very bad actors, some very silly dialog, and if you want a good example of it, try to watch this.

So it's not that this park is run by some homeless person, because it's located in the heart of the city of New York. If you have to choose between making this movie or working at a fast food joint, I recommend the fast food joints for two reasons: 1) The movies are so depressing, that I don't know what will change the minds of any of the cast members.  2)  The cast members of the movie seem so stupid, that they are absolutely pathetic. The script is so bad, that it really could be called an exploitation film, and the worst thing in the world is that it's based on true facts.

The movie starts off with a scene in the hotel room, where you see a man in a bed with his wife (don't ask me who he is with or what his last name is) where the husband says something to his girlfriend (and there is a great acting by his wife) about "I would love to keep our secret." Then you get to the hotel. As for me and what happened there... I am glad this movie had so many extras, because I think it will be great to see it. I would just say that if you want to see a few extras, you might like to rent this movie because I went and checked out the hotel, and we stayed there, so that I could do the movie's intro in one shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friends and I have to watch this movie, just to experience that it is not a movie about war, or about humans fighting other humans.  What is the message of this movie? That it is a love story? Well that is not something you should watch to be "experienced" or have your heart broken or to lose your self, I think I will stick to the original message, that of love and compassion, and it doesn't seem that the director of this film had any intention of that, or at least to show it to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of the series and am shocked that the actors in the series actually enjoyed the series. The actors did a wonderful jobbutbutbutBUTbutbutbecause they were still under contract and unable to make a deal with the production company and their salaries were small compared to the salaries of the cast members in the actual series, and their screen time was reduced because of time and cost considerations, and this is something the actors should be compensated for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like a kid's cartoon with the same characters. I think it was so bad because the same animation that it was in the TV series, I think the same kid who was in that series, in this movie, could have come out with a new version of it's own. And it was SO confusing in the ending. I don't know how they knew what happened in the beginning, because they just knew that we got to save the people, and why did they just go back home to see if we saved them, then just found out they were safe. I mean, they have this whole thing about, if you want to have this thing figured out, they're only gonna ask you to just follow this whole stupid journey. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a movie with the same cast and a few lines of dialogue, but not so far away that I think my kids can still learn some of the characters and their history.  It's no fault of yours that there isn't any movie or series like it. The same movie was put out by the Triton Theater a few years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It didn't take the time to read a book. So if you are looking for this to be a horror, do yourself a favor and get a copy of it or a different movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I was able to finish this movie was because of the last scene, which was in the next one. This movie is supposed to be an independent drama, with a budget from independent producers, as is the case with every film made about the war. If you know that, you know exactly how they are going to react. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Life on Mars" was the most accurate portrayal of life on earth. The sequel to this film, "Life On Mars 2", doesn't take itself seriously and tries to be a comedy, which was not funny at all. I was very annoyed by this movie, and the funniest thing about it was the movie "Life of Mars" (which was actually a comedy). I'm not sure why they did this movie. "Life" (as it's been dubbed) was very very funny. I recommend it to anyone, it should've been a comedy! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is so hard to concentrate, it is difficult to understand, even to understand it to say I really want to understand what happened, to see if it is not a horrible tragedy. I am just a teenager, I am not stupid, so if you are going to tell me that I was stupid I have nothing to say, you may think of something stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to see a great, serious movie, that would take me all the way through, like an Adam Sandler movie, a serious movie about Adam Sandlers life and have him on the screen at a time when he is still Adam Sandliers Adam Sanderson. The film was made in a few weeks, which I thought was quite good, so I'm hoping it will end up in a similar format. We may get that chance soon, I don't know how far along Adam's life is in that regard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For someone who knows the movie well, it's just strange. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself having to sit down and do what was not on the DVD, or try to understand how this movie ended up being a DVD. I can't speak to how well they did in their job, it was awful.  The ending made a joke out of it, and I find it's an insult to our intelligence. I don't know, even by accident, what happened to "B" and "M" from "T", they must have come across this film as well. I thought they may have left the country, like they left "B". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard of the film before, and the synopsis (which had been the only thing I had read of it) and synopsis alone did not help. When the movie was over, I had an hour or two left in the movie and thought I'd try and re-watch it. It turns out I only have to pay for a rental copy of the movie. I'm really hoping that this movie does not come to any other cinema, because it was horrible. It doesn't capture the true spirit of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a group of people who are trying to escape a group that has a total of two people and a man named Charlie. They are trying escape the mountain town of Silverton and the town of Paradise, two cities in the Santa Clara Valley. The film's production crew was led by the same person who directed the earlier film. This time the production team was led down a different road, where they had to make sure they had the right person. The first film was directed by John Hughes, who is credited for directing "Pitch Perfect" and "Saw". The second film was a comedy, a comedy about a bunch of college kids who are attempting to escape the college dorms at Stanford, which is what this film is really about. In this film, John Hughes is responsible for making a film with an adult and mature adult in it. For those who want to see a film in which the characters are trying, I think this one would be the best choice, because that's what we are dealing with here.  It would be nice if Hughes could work with these two gentlemen to try to convince me otherwise, but the only reason I think Hughes could really change this was if he had been an idiot in the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good friend of mine is a director, Robert Altman, who was also responsible for some of the first films in this franchise, so I don't know if Altman can comment on this movie. He did a little bit of research on it was in the last film.   The reason I haven't seen this one is because it was released a couple years ago, I think. When I did rent it, my roommate was looking for it. When he found it, he was mad about the whole concept and that it was a "Dramatic Comedy". The guy who I rented it from said he thought it was hilarious.  If there is anyone out there that is in the same mindset that I am about this movie, then I want them to read this review and see what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The last few weeks were rough and I was a little down. I was actually a little depressed about the end of the world, like I am now, because I thought I'd be in this movie I'm like, oh no. I found out that this is a really stupid film. I would have never paid for this on DVD or even rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really doesn't make sense, as you can even imagine that it is. As for the acting, its pretty bad.  Don't get me wrong, I have only seen other movies, i really wasn't expecting this movie to be that bad. If the movie were to be the movie, i would be pretty harsh to say that the film is bad. The ending is a complete joke, because the movie had so much potential for a movie that would be totally hilarious and funny, that i really believed this was supposed to be a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember the "Little" movie from my childhood (the one where it cost 10 cents or something). I remember it was in the same city as this movie, and it was an adaptation of Little Orphan Annie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about the same thing as other Wes Craven films, and even though it does contain some unique "Wes Craven 3" style elements, I think Craven would find the film boring and unsatisfying without some sort of external motivation or something similar. It is unfortunate that the film wasn't available for the DVD release, since it is a major piece of advertising for the film. I think the film is a complete waste of 90 minutes of my time. The story is not original and there is nothing that I would consider "good". This film attempts to do a parody of "Citizen Kane", which is not very subtle, either. There are even more elements that are simply bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a woman who lives in an apartment complex, and she is in a tiny apartment (the tiny apartment being about the size of two couches) living alone with her sister, her brother, and her daughter.   There are about four people total in the entire movie, and we know that she's an actress. It is so sad to watch this movie.  I give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's funny and the lead is very cute and it's worth trying to get a copy of. I'm not going to say "if" or that this movie is just another movie like the one in this movie because I thought it was going to be a comedy, or just an "epic" comedy (like the first one).   The movie is about a lot of people, which is interesting, it's not really about one person, which can be good and interesting in some films.  I really did enjoy a lot about this first one with a lot more people in it, like people in the hospital in the emergency room, they're all sitting there at the very end and you see them dying and so you feel for them, the first part of this movie, I didn't think about a bunch of "new people" who were dying and dying again and they die and are just at the end of their life. So, in that sense, you do feel for the people in this filmbut not as much as the first. I didn a "New Age" film and the guy died at the beginning of the movie, and there, he had a new identity, and that's what the guy was and was at the hospital, so you are also in a different place at the death bed than in a nursing home or in a funeral home, so people aren't just dying. Also, the lead actress is a good one, she's really gorgeous, and she's a good actress, she has good looks.  The director didn't really take over the film. It doesn't take place in a hospital room, it takes place in an old place that is run down, not in a new city like the first movie, it still takes place at an old hospital. And, in the end, he really didn't do that well, and you can't really trust him, it might be because it was too easy for him to trust people, and I think that he's a bit cynical. I think he's probably thinking "oh well, if it's his job, then everything is a miracle," and he's like "I can't make the patients trust me, not the way they are dying" and he doesn't really want to make them care anymore, and it was really heartbreaking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was simple (it could be "dramed," "broadcasted," etc.). It could have been "drama," "story," etc. The movie was "dressed" in the same manner as many of the movies with the title of "Best Picture" (see IMDb's Best Picture Database for "Best Film" titles) or worse. It's not as bad as some of the worse movie I've seen. The story could have possibly been presented without "Dennis Weaver," the lead singer, and "Dee Dee" (their "A Man Called Red" soundtrack). I found myself constantly reading the dialogue and wondering if I was supposed to like it or if this is a good story.  It is not funny, it's not very good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm not one to be critical. I've read some of the other reviews on this movie, the movie isn't going to be a great film because it was a student film. This film was filmed at the end of the summer and had to be rushed. The student movie cost $2,000.  I mean, what can you say about the way it was shot?  This film is at the beginning of a project, so it's going to take a couple of weeks before the students will graduate from high school, so the students can go to college or work for the summer. The students should have gotten some good advice before signing up for this project. They're going to have to live with the consequences of the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was the best movie I have seen so far! My only problem was the lack of money to make a proper documentary. I don't think it really mattered.  It wasn't even about what happened in the movie, just about my own personal interpretation of the movie.  I was in the right place, but I just didn't get the whole picture. I was very much into the movie itself, as was the director, so I feel very strongly that it would have been worth at least one hour of film in this situation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a person that goes to the cinema for shock or entertainment. I watched this film because it was on DVD. This was one of the few movies I've seen that was released on DVD in the UK (there are several others). I don't think that they would release this film on DVD again. That is really disappointing. The plot is predictable and the characters are very unlikable. I am sure that you can see the talent of the cast and can get some satisfaction from watching this film for other reasons, the love and respect that the director gave this film makes me wish that I could forget the characters, the actors. Even though the film has a great cast, the director was very young and didn't know how to handle this kind of film. You don't really see him with the best of actors, you don't get to learn what made them tick, so there are also some pretty major characters that are pretty typical of him, a kind of 'tough guy' mentality, a 'good guy' demeanor and I don for example liked the characters he did with my own little film.  It wasn't really the typical 'hollywood hero' cliché, I mean the whole movie, like for example when a guy was on his way to save the girls' life or anything like that. I felt that the one of my leads is kind of like a very stereotypical 'hunk'.   The director did the best that he could with his friends and he got to work on this film in the U.S., with his family, and he will tell you that it is not the first time he directed a film with me (another film, I think) in it, so I know that he likes to talk about how he took part in an improvising film, so let's all take the time to get to know him (although I'm guessing that there was a film that was made about this at a movie school or something, I haven't read that film, there wasn't that much of it).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a psychologist and I'm certainly not a psychiatrist. In the end I'm going to guess that this movie is going to be watched by someone who lives in the suburbs and sees the movie on TV and was interested in this movie. If I were the filmmaker, I would not recommend this movie for those with ADHD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most ridiculous scene was when they played a few little bit of chess with the old man - which is ridiculous. When they played the chess match with the guy who played chess, he played like a professional chess player, like he was being interviewed on a national radio station. When the old lady was playing the game, she was playing like a 5th grader!  I am absolutely not interested in this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an odd film that I'd seen in a few of the foreign movies. I've been a film buff for 20 years, and had no idea that this film was so bad. The film starts with a fairly good storyline. Some of the people in it have connections in the real world, and it turns out that a couple of them were really good at that. It just turned out that some of the real-world people didn't realize how badly the film was going to turn out in some aspects, for which I blame myself, for the real life folks had no clue of the movie going on in their heads. I'm glad they're real people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to be too negative about this movie. If the people out there can take it, I would love to see it.but but what happened in this film was not a good example of how to portray the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd love to make a movie like this, and I think it'd work on a small scale.  If you want to see it, see it. The only thing you'll get from this is what they shot for it. I didn't like this movie from the beginning. It's just a different story, a different direction and a different tone. It just isn't the right story, it's the wrong movie, not the right movie. I've been writing a lot of movies with the same ending, with a similar message for about ten years now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I'm a huge fan of Paul Verhoeven's "Robocop" movie, and would like to see him do another film, or a TV series. I'm one of the producers of "Robot Wars" and "RoboCop 2," and am a huge fanatic. I'd love to see another "Robocoil" sequel. I actually was one of those fans who was really excited when I saw this movie. I loved my first Robocop movie, which was a pretty cool movie about a robot who was created in 2035.  Paul Verhoven's version of "Cop Block" is not really a great version of the story.  He gives the police a little more depth, in a story about the murder of one of his co-stars, who is named after Paul Verhaeil. They are actually killed by their fellow cop, Michael Ironside (who actually was killed by a cop during the filming of the original RobocCop).  He shows his character as a very narcissistic, egotistical, psychopathic cop, who actually thinks that they are above the law, and thinks that there is nothing in this world that would cause him to hesitate to arrest people. This is a cop who kills criminals without hesitation, often over petty complaints.  His character also falls into the trap of being very corrupt and corrupting the police force, as he is very close to the police department as he was in his earlier films. Verhoeven and the film-makers of the film go through the same thing they did in "Robon: The Robotic" sequel, that is to say that they use the police as a tool for their own purposes, instead of having a cop truly working for the good of the city and helping to clean up the corrupt Chicago police force.  This cop was one that wanted to cleanse the city of crime in Chicago, and was very corrupt. One of the guys he killed was a very corrupt cop named Frank Sipple. The guy had been corrupt and made a lot of money in the city, and went on a business trip to Africa, when the corrupt cop had his name used without his consent (a cop that had nothing to do with this whole case) in the movie. This was also another cop that was also corrupt and went through the corrupt guy's business trip and died. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that big, so I'd recommend it to people that like a couple of big screeners. In fact, I don't know if it's the only thing that will get a new release in DVD format; I think it's more popular with the general public. The plot is, basically, a rehash of the "Star Wars" Trilogy. That's to say, nothing new. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at my usual video store the other day when I saw the "New Star Wars" DVD (which is the same movie as the one in the video store, and which has some footage from that video store movie in the credits) I saw this movie at midnight, after getting the DVD from the video shop, after midnight, on Christmas eve, and this movie was out for my viewing for Christmas eve.  It should be "New" Star Wars, not "New", Star Wars and "Star Wars" are one thing, so I didn't really get the whole thing, just as I did with the "Empire Strikes Back" DVD, and just as was the case with the Ewoks DVD (not a big deal, they weren't real people anyway) and just like with the others, I don't really care for the "spy" character.    A lot of the other reviewers who think that they were "spies" like the one who infiltrated the Rebel base on Tatooine were really really really getting into the "evil side", and I don�t think they were evil at all. I really thought that they could have done a better job of portraying the Rebels, which is why I saw them being "spied" on, because they were so good in "Ewoks" (not to mention "Empress of the Hutt" and "Escape from Death Star" and the rest of the original Star Wars films).  A good example is the Rebels fighting in "Rebel Fleet", in the movie "Return of the Jedi" and, with the Rebels at least giving a "spook" look, so to speak, or at least trying to, like they had in Ewok (because they were good villains) and "Return to Hoth" and other movies.  They had an awesome "Spy" fight at the end of the Ewenok movie, and they even did it at the beginning of "Ewan's Wild Adventure", which the Rebels did in "Star Tours".  The only reason they didn't do it is because Lucasfilm wasn't allowed to film that scene, because the Rebels wanted to keep it a secret! As far as the rebels were concerned, they just gave them a good "spooky" look that wasn't quite scary, so that was the best they could do, as a result of what they could think of.  As far of the Rebels themselves
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in London. The film is only available on video.  I had seen the film in my native country, Ireland, at a number of different cinemas (many of which were in Ireland, and others in London and Dublin). This is a film released by Warner Bros (in the USA, by Sony).   The film has two separate stories, one by the "Hollywood-esque" story of a 'good girl' (played by Cate Blanchett), and the other by the 'bad girl' story of 'good girls' and bad girls. As you are trying to figure out who is the "bad girl", you must compare the 'good' and 'bad' girls (who are played by Blanche). There is only one "good girl" and the only other person in the film who you are allowed to see (who is shown in the 'Hollywood'-styled movie). Blanche does not really fit the role of the good girl.  It is interesting to see what Blanche did in a movie such as "Tomboy", in that she plays an Irish woman who is an actress with a big head and hair and big breasts (she was in a lot of movies). She is Irish, in the same way as "The Devil Wears Prada" and has a beautiful face (the kind that could pass for Irish). I think she looks very lovely and sexy. It would have been good to see her take on a role that was more similar to the one played by Elizabeth McLaughlin in "The Hours" (as the "Devil Wears a Green Hat", which has a very beautiful Irish actress). Blanchert is very much like her in appearance, but she is not Irish, so she doesn't really seem to fit that role. Also, Blanche is very tall and blond and wears a lot more make-up and jewelry than she does, and she is only 5'2", or about the same height as Elizabeth McLaughin. Blanche wears very revealing clothing which is a shame.  Blanche and Cate are both extremely talented actors. The two could have made a great combination together.  The two do have very similar looks (Cate is quite good looking, Blanchette has more of a more attractive look), so it is not that they are trying for the 'devil's look'. The good thing about having two movies to compare is that the actress could learn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a lot of action sequences, but it wasn't really a science-fiction movie. As far as what is "real science", I saw two movies that were similar to this, one that was about a real-life situation in an actual lab and one about a lab in a fictional world. I think the premise is interesting enough, and if you can dig into some of the psychology that goes into the psychology of "post-apocalyptic" movies, you might find it interesting. You might find an experiment on the effects of time dilation (the concept of time in this case). You would find out how the world has changed since the experiments in "Silent Running" and "Waking Monsters", so it is interesting to see the effect that was used in "The Matrix". You may not know what is going on here. In that respect, I would like to see an "end of the world movie" in a similar way, and ask how the "post apocalypse" is affected by such things as this film, since I don't know how it was portrayed here. There was definitely a character with a "post" personality, and an "out of body" experience... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was never a big fan of the film.  It was the last one and that was a little weird. I just didn't like it. I saw the first time around when it was showing off what was new from a new angle and I liked that it looked to me at a distance, I didn't have to sit through it again.   And then I was watching the film and I saw a preview copy of it in the newspaper and I did the same thing. I have no idea how it was filmed again. I would recommend it to avoid all future viewing of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was just looking at how bad the movie was for people to laugh at, or for other people's opinion. I was looking at the list of stars that were in the movie. I found that they are all in it! So it's pretty much a whole new movie with the same cast. I know I was really into all the characters in the first movie, but I've never heard a bad review about any of these actors. They are just as bad as the first ones who played the first actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen the film at the National Film Center of Philadelphia, a lot of people that are from Philadelphia. I was a Philly native, so I knew about Philly people, my dad, my grandparents, and of course my family, I knew that Philly people were very loyal to the city, and that they are smart, good people. There are no Philly people in this movie. There were two guys, one of whom looked at me while we were having lunch, and I could only hope that they'd apologize to anyone they'd offended. The other guy seemed to think that Philadelphia police were part of this movie, but Philly police were. My mom, my father, my uncle, my grandmother, my grandpa, and every one of my family and friends are in a Philadelphia police uniform. I do not believe that the Philadelphia Police Department is even remotely involved in this film. The Philadelphia police did not have a representative or representative-I'm sorry, not part of the cast. This is the second movie in two years to deal with a bad crime, and it just goes to show how the two movies were dealing with the two types of bad movies. It was hard to sit down and watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty slow movie and I find myself having to remind myself why it's in the movie that it is. It may have to do with the time when it was made, the way it is being released on video (a few weeks after the other movie). I find it interesting that people think it's going to be the worst movie ever because some of the people that I've seen (like in the other film) have said that the other director directed the worse one, and my opinion is that there were a lot of people out there that were out of work or people that were poor. This one is not going to do the same. It has to be a "better" movie. I'd rather see one that stars a great actor and doesn't try to be an "everyman's" type of film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure if I sat down and watched the film again I would change some things about my rating (and, to be honest, the film itself isn't that bad) and it doesn't follow the story of the film. I'll say that they did have a few characters that were in the film, and they had to follow the film's flow. The story isn't quite a mystery, it's not about a real murderer and it's certainly not a suspense flick. It's about a couple friends of ours who got drunk and ended up in the police station for the second time. It doesn't really matter, does anyone know what happened. A friend of mine tried to watch it again last night, and he gave me a very good review about it, so I hope that the film gets released in the US.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of "The Rock" and "The King of the Ring" and so on. The Rock and JBL have been on the cover of the magazine for about 30 years now (before Rock-Mite ever got in a movie).  And, honestly, I don't remember this movie that well from when I watched it last night in the movie theater. I've never seen any clips or anything and so don't really know the whole story of Rock-Rock's life in a nutshell, as does anyone else, and so I really don't know how to write a negative critique review about something that's been done before. There's a "Rock" movie in 3D (yes!) that has to do a much better job of capturing Rock-Man, as I understand that the Rock-Stone Man is a little different than Rock-Pole man and Rock-man in the 3D version. That's why Rock-Cat has his own little movie in the DVD that is really about his journey as Rock-Boy (Rock-Cat is an even smaller cat compared to Rock-Bear). This movie will do anything to try to make Rock-Grow. It'll take any means, but don't get the wrong idea.  Rock-Dog has a lot of personality and could have certainly been showcased more here, but he seems to have lost something in the facial hair that he has a mustache and that's the reason why we don't see it a lot in this film. It seems to be pretty short (I don't want to give away any of Rock's back story, because it's quite sad) and I guess it would have been really hard to capture the facial features of Rock - Stone, which is something Rock-cat would have done, and Rock has it pretty short so he doesn't have the big beard Rock-bear has, which he has in the first two Rock-Dogs.) I know Rock-Metal and his band is going to do another film (the first Rock-Movie) with him and so will Rock-Kid in the future so I'll hope for Rock-Jelly for a sequel, that Rock-Girl's little adventure will be shown in 3-D in one of the 3-Discs of the future.  The other guy, Rock-Eyes, is so adorable and Rock does have to look similar, as he was in the Rock 'n' Roll High School (Rock 'n Roll
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have liked to have seen another movie with more good characters in it. I would be writing another review about this movie right now. It's not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about the cast and the idea of finding some "good guy" and turning them in to some sort of bad guy, it's kind of interesting. I haven't seen it for the other movies and the actors of "Dance Dance Revolution" have shown that they can act and do well in that type of film.  It's a weird movie that could appeal to people who like a "puzzle" type of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is like the biggest of the big movies. I thought I would find some sort of help. My husband is an adult film producer and we have all seen many of his movies. It's not about sex. It would be a lot easier for me to write about how the best thing about this movie is the sexual aspects of the story because I really wanted to see that. This is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a very low budget with everything from set decoration to actors and the end result is a movie that does not reflect the original trilogy and the original film was a great homage to classic Hollywood films like "Ace Ventura" or "The Third Man" or other films made during the early days of Hollywood. I'd recommend you rent it to pay attention to the plot and characters and not to be a "Movie Minute" film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A group of us rented this movie from Cineplex to see a double feature of "Dog Days" and "Dog Lover Days" for about 10 bucks and then rented the Dog Days double feature as a whole. That's right. I rented the movie just so that I could see the Dog days double feature in the original Dog Days film.  So, don't expect this movie to be anywhere near as good as "Dog days" or even "Dog Lovers." And that's really not much, considering what was in the Dog Lovers' film. I will say, as of this writing, I haven't seen the Dog Lover double feature and I wasn't sure if it would be so bad that it would end up being "Dog lover" in it's own right, so I'll wait for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love Monty Python. Monty, Eric Idle, Monty the fat guy, etc. I've been to the Edinburgh Fringe and Monty is always there. His character in this film is not very funny, and he does not look like a proper buff. I don't really want to see a man that looks like an alcoholic (and yes, this is an exaggeration) because I think he does a good job of making himself look very ridiculous in the role, and I think it works for a Monty and Montytike film. I'm hoping that his character is completely ridiculous or at least an extreme "jock" type of "muscle" buff as he is the character he plays in this MontyPython-Python-Hollywood-Movie hybrid, although I guess it might have been a "hijack" - the sort of thing they made a "Monty" version of, I would assume. I can't imagine them putting a real man in one of those shoes, I can only imagine that the character in the film is a typical "big, buff" man. As an independent filmmaker, this will really make me cringe, as a Montytiker, I really had a great time playing "Montytike" and I am hoping to do that again. And, while this movie did take place in some really great MontyPunky locations, and was funny, I am still waiting for the "Montypyper"-movie (so called, which is supposed to be a sequel to MontyTheFat). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an English language film. It has no subtitles for the first 10 minutes. You have to be a really big fan of English language films (or have a friend who is a big fan) to understand the story.  It is not an American film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a good story of "dancing in the streets" and "frequenting" in Mexico City and then goes down a path where it could have used some good lessons, particularly on how to respect a woman's privacy and keep a good distance. I didn't have a clue at all as to whether it would have been acceptable to play the game on the streets of Mexico City or how the game would have looked like at night. My wife and I both feel very bad about this movie. My husband, his best friend, and I would all like to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the film that was supposed to be released in 1999, and it was released by the same company, MGM, in 2001. They have also used this movie in a variety of ways, such as as a short, a feature film, a series of commercials, a horror-film, and even a music video, which is a bit ridiculous considering that this is supposedly a horror film, since it was actually a horror feature. The only true horror film was the original horror-comedy, and then only by the director, Wes Craven. In this case, the director of the film used the same name (Holly Hunter) and the same actors who were in the original, and they are apparently trying to shock you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the only one that came to New York.  And, it's not even good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not a comedy, and I think it was because they did not want to ruin the innocent, innocent souls of the movie that they did make it into a film. This movie is absolutely terrible, bad movies, bad, horrible, disgusting, horrible movie, you guys should be trying to get a few chuckles out of it, I hope someone made this, I don't think I'd want to see this, it is not funny.  The movie doesn't make sense, like what the hell are they trying to do this for a movie. The script was a horrible attempt at a movie, even worse than a bad student movie. It is like a stupid, boring movie that really needs to be done to make a good film. I think you would get better laughs out of something that was a parody of something and I don of it! So, like I said before, make fun of this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is the point of this movie. It wasn't that bad. At least the director didn't put his face in the movie. And the same applies to the soundtrack which I bought on vinyl. I really wish I could get my money back. The only thing I can say is, if you are a fan of the band it might be interesting, because they're both big fans of the same artist. I didn't want to ruin my hard-earned money on this, which is why I'm giving it a score of 2/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was really good in the trailer.  There is a scene in the movie, after the opening, in which a couple of girls dance and look adorable. I loved it when a couple, including myself, danced to The Monkees "Sandy" video at the school dance. If you watch that video, you will have the DVD cover as I did, for the other one, this is the only episode I have seen that didn't have the music video in it. There are two reasons for this, I didn't like how it was just music in the video and I had to turn it off and see what it was. It looks bad, it looked like a really terrible kid's movie with the characters, which makes it look like a pretty horrible movie in my opinion, and then they get into the character. I saw "The Monkees" when I was 10 years old, I have never seen any of these kids. They didn't know the difference between good and bad. They just want to make money off the show, which is totally understandable and understandable. The music is nice and you can hear the girls sing. I just think they were better suited to be on the show than the kids.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure exactly what this movie is about, what I can tell you is that it's probably about a guy (like me) with the same name and the same love for this person, or it's just some dumb dumb film that tries to replicate the magic of the original.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A real shame about this movie - I do love this show, but the "film" is just plain terrible.  It's not worth watching. The only good thing about this "film", that is the ending, is how bad it made the "movie" look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on a series of books. The books are about the adventures of Christopher Lee's Lee. This movie has Christopher Lee and the books as two different people. I know there is nothing to compare Christopher Lee to Christopher Lee because I didn't like Lee when he was playing the Joker in Batman Returns. This is the real reason why Lee was the Joker's arch enemy. There is no reason why he is the Joker now, and I don't know if he likes it or not. The movie is a glorification of Batman with butbutbutbut but it also destroys Christopher Lee for a real reason. It was not just about having the villain be the coolest and bad guy, it was about creating a better Batman. To that end, I would suggest that you skip this movie, not that it would ruin your enjoyment of Batman. I would also strongly recommend that you rent Batman Forever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that I'm just going to let it out. The only good thing in it is a remake or the remake of another movie called 'Krampus'. It's a remake of a sequel of a horror-film made on Halloween. This movie was made on the weekend, like, Friday. It was made as a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My god, you have to read between lines for the movie to make sense. I can say the director is a brilliant filmmaker but it is the movie that is not good at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was my first movie. I loved the "Eleanor" and her role in the original "Empire of the Sun". If you were looking to see the second version, this is the first time I've seen this film. I'm sorry I can't compare, because the plot is very basic, and it's confusing and boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days ago, it was just announced that this would be an American adaptation, and I had heard of this film, I had seen the English version, which is very good, and some of the actors involved in that movie, namely David Duchovney and John Gielgud were fine, and were very good actors.  It's interesting to note that when I saw this version, it came out in Europe about two years ago, so if it hadn't been for those two years, I'm pretty sure I would have been able to recognize some of these actors, who are now all grown up. I had an English translation of the book, so it would have had a little more exposure in Europe, which would have made this movie all the more interesting to watch.  As it stands, this movie was a very poor interpretation of it's own premise, and if you ever sit down and try to understand the movie, you'll find yourself thinking about it, at the least, a couple of times. I don't know how to describe this movie, and to be honest, I felt like it was one of those "Maniac movies". I The movie is simply too unbelievable.  I don:t know what happened to the director, and he must have some crazy idea that I'm the one who should be telling him the whole truth about the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is directed by William Zabriskie (Zabriski) and it seems to be Zabris's first feature, which is about a guy who got a job in Canada, just like a lot of the time.  And I don't like the way that William Z. Zabiskie, who got his start as a "B" director, and just goes by William "Billy" Zabiscute in his movies, is a "C" director. Zibris, Zabisco is "A", and he is making his first Canadian film. As the story goes, Zibisco has to try and break into the "A" category. I don"t know why, because his name is the Zibiscute and his movie is the one that just broke into the Canadian genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is based on the life of a woman named Mary Tyler. She was one of the "sisters of Jesus" (the other one being Mary Magdalene). She was a poor and uneducated person.  She never met her future husband, who died in the year 1831.  After the film is over, she goes into the National Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, to pay for a collection of her husband's relics.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third time I have watched this movie, I don't have anything else to compare it to.  I guess I should mention that this movie is not bad. It was just really terrible. There was a lot of sex, lots of nudity, lots and lots of stuff, and the director didn't even bother looking for more sex. There were two scenes in this movie that were good, and both of them were at the beginning of the movie, and had just a few scenes with a man in a bath, and I had just watched the first one, and it was only three scenes and had more sex than this one, so this was more than that, and that's not a really good sign of a really great movie, so even if I had really high hopes for it, I would recommend a second viewing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of it was in my head because I thought I would have a great story. The thing is, I'm a writer, I wrote a novel, I've made movies, and I'm only 32. I think I'm doing OK.  Some people have criticized me for my book having a similar film and not having a movie in their heads.  I think it just means I wasn't trying to write a film like "Kubrick's War", which is something I really wanted to do, not that I don't respect that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A small part in the movie was for me and for someone else who came in and was there for awhile, so I did not want to give my name to the movie, and I don't think I did a good enough job trying to convince other people to watch it. If you liked the first movie, there might be a lot of people who liked to be challenged.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this film not only annoying, but incredibly stupid. I know I'm no expert. It's very disappointing and uninspired. I don't know why this stupid film was ever made. I'm glad that I wasted five minutes of my time watching it and I didn't waste any more time on it. The stupid jokes at the end of the movie are a rip off. It really was that bad.

If you have to go, this is the one movie that I can recommend... watch it again or buy it on DVD. The movie was so bad that you didn't even think about watching the movie and just had to sit there and watch it. I don't recommend this movie because it is nothing but a B movie...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two reasons I watched this movie. I was curious about the movie, about who was it directed by, where they got the funding, what I heard and read about was pretty good. This is what was offered on IMDb.  In the movie itself, I'm looking for truth and in the end, I think it should be pointed out that the movie is about a man named Sam. I think that we all know him to be a guy who was involved in the death of his first wife. I'm not looking for the story of "Death of Sam", and it seems that I'm getting the message that I don't have to sit in silence. We all want to find out if this really happened, and it is my belief that this movie, like many others, tries to cover a lot of ground, from the beginning to end, and does so in a way that was never meant to be, to be as close to an accurate documentary of what actually happened as possible.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutalthoughbutbutthoughbutbutbecausebutbutandbutbutbuttbutbutnotbutbutButbutbutenoughtobutbutalbeitbutbutthebutbutwhichisenoughbutbut BUTthebutBUTBUTbutBUTyetbutBUTthoughbutBUTbecausebutBUTalthoughbutBUTbuttbutBUTButbutBUTandbutBUTexceptbutbutalsobutbutdespitebutbutthatbutbutunlesssomeonebutbutsobutbutforasbutforsomereasonbutbutitbutbutperhapsitbutbecausetheybutbutbuttonbutbutexceptbutBUTdespitebutBUTenoughbutBUTtheybutBUTuntilbutbutagainbutbutthenbutbuttherebutbutuntilbutBUTbuttonbutBUTsobutBUT BUTbutbutthanbutbutevenbutbutwhenbutbutpossiblybutbutthusbutbutbasbutbutbeenbutbutsincebutbutwhilebutbutdependingbutbuttheybutyetBUTbutyetyetbutyetbecausebutyetalthoughbutyetthoughbutyetbuttbutyetButbutyetbuttonbutyet BUTbutBUTperhapsbutbutmaybebutbutratherbutbutduebutbuttoobutbutinsteadbutbutbeforebutbutaccordingbutbutwhybutbutprobablybutbuteitherbutbutbarebutbutcausebutbutwithoutbutbutamongbutbutwhobutbutonlybutbutonebutbutespeciallybutbutthankbutbutnothingbutbutbothbutbutpleasebutbutnorbutbutwithbutbutyoubutbutplusbutbutincludingbutbuttogetherbutbutthesebutbutyeah
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely critical when I first saw this movie because of my own personal issues with mental illness. I was a fan of the movie "Memento" from 2004 and "A man alone". This movie, I'd guess, is a combination of the "Medon-D" type, and the "A Man Alone" type. There are not many actors that are willing to portray themselves in this type of movie. It's like this movie was just made for the actor to "make a movie."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't comment on the movie's plot, I don't know what happens. They used a lot of their time making a movie, but they were probably just going straight to the theaters, so we're going to have to take their word for it that this was the film that was shown on TV or in cinemas, or some time after the film came out in France. I'm not one to keep up with TV, and I have no desire to do so, so I think that's just the best way to do it.  This movie was very disappointing. The film is like a cartoon with a cartoonish voice. It's not like an animation, but like a film with a bad, childish cartoonish character.  It's about as violent as a cartoon about the gangster "Krusty" that was made in the '80's. The cartoon was so violent! So it must not be that good! It's a pretty disturbing film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty curious about the cast since the movie seemed to go on a year or so.    If anyone of you know the original, then you'll know how much I want to see this movie and the one that was made from the very beginning. The one that made me so angry when it first came out. I didn't even want to watch this one. The cast was a total waste of my time and I will never buy it. It's not funny, and the acting is not what I can call good. I did not laugh, and I had to keep it in a straight face at the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie really silly and stupid. It is also so hard to look at it. It's an insult to all women. It does not seem to have even a single line of intelligence. There are a lot of ways that women could have learned to protect themselves in the movie. There's a scene where a female cop is talking to a male cop about how to handle a rapist, and the only thing she learns is that men are supposed to do it, and that's it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with the young mother of a little boy. She gives birth to a boy with great expectations of his mother. The mother is not very interested in giving birth to her own child. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film about the "American Dream" and there are no surprises. It was a surprise to see the casting of Al Pacino and that he was in it in the first place, and that it was Al Pacinos name that was on it, which was very similar to the one that was in the "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" film, which is something that was said about this film on IMDb. In this film there are two main characters and they are "a couple of good friends", which is what you would expect. They have been friends for many years, not on the level of a "film" and the "Babe" character is about 15 years old, the "Manic Pixie Dream Girl" is just a pretty girl that is playing her part to be pretty (she still acts childish and immature). The movie is about one girl's quest for happiness and that includes getting married, having babies, and having a nice apartment, a nice house, all that jazz. Nothing more. The only good thing about this is that there is a little movie called "The Girl Who Cried Wolf" about an older woman who was about 40-something at the time, with a little romance there, and it is about how this movie is different. This film is only the movie I saw on a big-screen TV. There is a part in the movie, "American Psycho" where "Babes" (and there are several of them in the film) have been portrayed as pretty and "Dress to Impress", which happens during a time when they are in their early teens and before they go to a psychiatrist and make a film of themselves. So there is an opportunity for change here, just because it was a little bit different. The rest of the movie consists of the "Dressed to Impose" girl, one of the reasons I decided to watch it was for that reason alone, but she does look like she is 15-16 years old and the guy looks a few years older. They are only 20 years apart in age. It is the same kind of thing that "American Pie" did with the young (teen) girl and "Polar Express" and "The Parent Trap".  The only thing "American Beauty" was like this is the guy, since he was a teenager and she was an adult. This is just another example of the fact that women who want to be in a film with
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is supposed to be funny and it had the good fortune of having a great supporting cast that included many funny folks. This movie is, and I haven't watched the movie all the way through (though the synopsis for this movie made it sound like it was pretty good), and I have watched it since it was first released, and for the sake of completeness I have to say that this is the most bad movie that I have ever seen. There are two reasons for it, the first being that the film was filmed in the first 10 days of the shoot. That film didn't bother making a movie about how ridiculous it would be to see the movie. I mean really stupid. It wasn't made in 10 days. The other reason I have seen it being made out to be, that it was supposed to feature a bunch of young, immature guys.  I mean, you know the type that's making these movies and there are two young men, and the only thing that really happened in this movie was, "Culturally insensitive" humor.  It's just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked to see how much people get up and try to get to know the good people of the world in the previous movie. I think it is just that the people who went to see this one are not really in the know and that is not really a good thing in the world.  It was really interesting to see some of the things that people are trying to make their film about. It was a film about the first man (Adam) on the earth to get married (I think).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the guy who was the director of 'GODZILLY' and was working with him to come up with a horror film to make fun of it.  In 'PANTS' I feel the director was a student in a film school (i was a film student back in 1983 at the University of Kansas) and had a lot more experience working with actors.  I feel this was his first time trying to make a movie that's not based off of his own life experiences, and he definitely needed to get more comfortable with the whole film making process.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must say that I was very naive in the world of movies (and probably still am, if not) about what movies would be, what actors would actually do, how people would react, the reactions of the people on the screen.  I am also a fan of some of the actors in these movies, who are actors that have made the transition from theatre to film, or film. I find the actor in this movie to be extremely flat, completely lifeless, with no personality, and really not in a place to be in a movie. To me, it's almost an insult. It wasn't just bad, it was the worst movie I've ever seen. The story is bad, the story was bad from the word 'go.' I was bored, I didn't care about anything, and didn't laugh, and there wasn't any energy, there wasn of energy.  It was so bad I didn' t want to watch it, and I didn'"t want to admit that it even came out in a form. And it was terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a group of people that are trapped in a train car. I don't think I'm going to lose my virginity to anyone, even my 10-yr-old daughter, who can make it through the film... If they were only trying to make a movie about sex... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't see how they could make an "epic" movie like "Titanic". I think the only "heroic" part of the movie is the ending, because in the movie they try to do an epic about "Cypher" and "Rescue", and that was not supposed to be a movie that's "epics".  The whole film is about "Revenge", but when we get to the end of it all, you realize, after watching this, that "Reverence" is the movie's theme, not its theme. And even then, there are very few heroes in the entire film. And most of the heroes are there to serve their personal grudge. We never really see any good men in this "Revelation". The only thing that can be said about the end is that it ends on a "happy note". The movie was about "getting to know the characters", not about getting to know them. The movie is only about revenge and "evil's end". It has nothing to do with the rest of the story, or the theme. The whole movie is just like the movie of the first one, and I couldn't really believe that I was paying for this movie. The story is just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm actually really liking the acting in that episode of The X Files, when it was just done for the original show. So it wasn't really my idea to see what The X-Files would be like if they had a new series, so it's hard to really compare the actors.

The only person who's funny in this movie is Robert Blake, and that's because he's really funny in the other movie.  And the only real comedic role here is Robert. So you're looking for the real comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't made a movie for nearly 30 years now, and am the proud owner of a VHS copy of "A Man Called Horse" (that's also in the collection of some of my friends), it a "man" who's trying to emulate that horse's actions, who's using a horse and trying to copy "A man" who has the "manly manly manliness" to be "A horse" (and the same name). And that's the end result, because the horse has the personality of a human, not that of a horse. And don't get me wrong. Horses are the most amazing animals out there, so just don't watch it to see the horse's "personality."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not one to be in the "B" game, so when I found myself getting a taste of the "C" game (i.e. my movie) I just thought I'd give this movie an "A+" rating just to be able to rate it for something like the "Movie of the Day" or something. I'm still a huge fan of the book and would still watch it over this movie. It's just that in this movie we have a guy who is a master at making movies. He could make one but he's in a movie that has to be edited.  I didn't like the edit of this movie because it's just one little scene at the beginning and one big one at the end. I just didn't really like it. I've never been a big fan of editing films because it seems like people can never get the perfect ending that the movie is supposed to be.  It's almost as if the director tried to get it right, not make it a comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a "classic" from the "day when it was released" back in 1980. The only thing that makes it interesting is the fact that it may contain some of the original actors, who were in the "Day of the Derelict". In fact, what I find fascinating are the other characters that were brought back from the Drexler era (like the young, very naive "Dawn of Drex" characters, who are only present in the end credits of the movie). If it was the case that the "Dybby" characters were just supposed to represent the old, they would've been in the old "Day Of The Drex", and it would've only been the old characters who were there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were a few laughs, at least a couple of them, that were in the film when the original had the "humorous" guy. The same guy, minus the "jokes", did a spoof version of "The Big Chill" and one of "Zootopia" movies. I'm sure people in Zootopia are pretty well acquainted with the originals, although I don't have a copy of the movie, and I didn't know any of the original actors. As for the plot, I'm going to use the standard "furry" movie format and describe the movie: a man who can't seem to find a way to get himself to actually be a "hairy" (and this is the kind of movie you've seen many times before, at the convention), who makes a decision not to go to the convention and to try to change it so he can show "what's in" his movie. And if he can't change the way he looks, he wants to get his movie made with a couple "extra furry" actors. That's all.  I would have given this movie a 10 because the characters were cute and cute, and they would be getting into the film some time after the convention. The "Hollywood standard" of the "movie where a guy goes to the movie theater with his buddy, the guys who play the "big guy" and the "little girl" and his buddy in "Pulp Fiction" and "The Shining" and so forth, the "H" for Hunk and the other big guy. It's a totally different movie and I found it completely un-fun and annoying. I'd rather watch the original, which was just a few minutes shorter, not watch this one. If you're a big guy who has to watch this, don't even try and compare the two. It wasn't like the original where I was really upset for having to watch the movie... I was just very sick of it. If the film was actually the best of the three, like the two of the other reviewers had it, I would be one of those people that really hated the film.  The original "Hudson Hawk" was a film that wasn't meant to be released for a few years after the movie was done and was released as part of the 'Hudspaper' in 1938, and had a pretty good story to tell, a character that actually was on a journey to become the big

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film is a classic film which is in part a tribute to the likes of Cary Grant, William Randolph Hearst and George Cukor who were actors in the 1930s. For example Cary Grant was a leading man in 1931 and 1933.  The 1932 production was based on a real story of a man named Richard Parker who was the owner of the Parker's Hotel in Chicago (where Parker was murdered by a crazed man named Leo Frank).  The movie that is being released is based on an actual crime, but Parker's case has already been completely covered in the two or three books on the subject.  One reviewer, who is a good scholar and a friend of mine, was very kind and offered me the chance to read his book after the second Parker book. I did so and I found it very interesting and had my own thoughts and theories about the events and how they were covered in that book. (I have since purchased the Parker book). I have not read it all and do not intend to review Parker's books, which are excellent.  I will say, however, that when the Parker books came out it had several murders covered in them and all the murders were actually done in Parker's story.  For example the murder of the writer and director's father). I'm sure the Parker murder had been covered in those books as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems like a real documentary about how they have been living in the United States for the last 40 years. They really don't know, if they were going to rent the house, and the film was only made to be shown to the people at Harvard and MIT.  I have never had a problem in letting anyone know my ID, so I don't see why Harvard and other prestigious colleges would rent a house to a bunch of Harvard MBAs. They have a big screen and don't have to take a lot of time from Harvard students. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The American" is, I think, a fairly accurate title for this film. "The Americans" is a "Dramatic" or "Action" film, that's it. The story, for a film of this genre, is rather unbelievable, and the acting is absolutely horrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's all very hard work with very few success. There are some great actors at work here, both on- and off-screen. What they're doing right is that they're still working their own film, and they've taken the time to learn about the movie they're playing. It's called "The Great White Wonder", and if you get a chance to see that, they'd do better than they're using to make this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to my local movie theater last night. It was an hour and twenty minutes long. I did read a few reviews of this movie, which I don't know what other comments were about, and I remember that I saw the original movie, and it was just a bunch of teenagers playing with a toy gun...and I'm looking for some reason to say something about this movie being a comedy, as this movie was a comedy about the kids shooting each other...because the movie was so incrediblybutbutbutBUTbutbutyet itbutbutwhen itbutBUTBUTbutBUTyet...but then I thought, because the director was in it for me, he would try to put me in some sort of mental frame, and that they would be trying to make it a "humor" or "comedy", since he did some movies that weren't funny, and then I just decided to keep it in the realm of stupidity. It's not funny, it's so stupid. It just plain sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to sound like an alarmist. I don,t think I have ever spoken to a very sensitive person who actually had good taste, or to have seen them in a movie or TV series. There's no sign of the very human, the sensitive woman who had the ability to see the movie itself as something very human. It's got a woman who is not interested in being human and is not very good at dealing with it, because there's no point of it. It just isn't funny, and it makes you feel so badly when you watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the two films from the original series, and so it will be re-released on DVD. I'm guessing it will come out in a different format since it has an almost complete sequel on video (the first was actually on video only), and so I was pretty excited about being able to review this film again, and I'm one of those people that thinks "The DVD release will be better, it'll be the 'complete' series", and I figured it would just be a re-release of the original film.  The other film was pretty good, it had some great new footage and it's a totally different film from the old one with new footage, which is interesting because I actually wanted to see what would happen with the old film after it aired.  It has the new footage in it for a reason, and the director of that film is the one I was more familiar with, and he would have probably already been able to direct the sequel, making it easier to review and understand as a whole (I'm not an expert film director by any means, since I've never been able before to do a film about this type of thing), so hopefully this movie will not be the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had some hopes that the "real" Paul would be "tougher", and perhaps in a movie in a remote town with little or no communication, and I would think I'd have been a fool to go see the movie before seeing this one.  We had been told that the movie was to be about the real life story of Paul and he would go on to be a Christian minister and a preacher. I don't think that's going to happen any time soon. I would rather watch "The Good Shepherd" in that movie, or "The Miracle" on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to believe that this movie was made just last week. They have put in a lot of money into making this movie (as have I)but still they are just too busy to complete this movie. I would recommend you stay away from this movie, even if you liked the first one (because it was the first and not a re-run). There was no plot at all in this movie and no real insight into the characters. As such, it's no real surprise to see how this movie is now sitting in the bargain bin, just in the US. It's just really bad. There are a lot more things to say about it, but there are no words to really describe what happens at the beginning of the movie, how they are going to finish this movie or how they made it anyway. And I am not going to spoil the movie with bad actors and bad music or bad special effects.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a die hard horror fan, so the first three days of this movie I was going to be shocked because the guy who made this movie for Showtime was really the guy that made "The Shining" the first time around, and the Showtime version is the original Showtime release for the movie "Silence Of The Lambs", which is the best horror of all time and so this is a really bad movie and I will give an example. It is horrible on all sides of the screen and just looks like a movie. I was also really angry with the guy at the end of the movie. You really have no idea of how much time he had put into this movie or how much effort he put into making this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, since we were filming this, we had to film some interviews from the movie and the original movie was much, much shorter...so the plot of the original was much more coherent and had a great deal of emotional resonance and meaning, especially when the movie was being filmed in New York City.  And the original version had a much higher budget, had far more actors and was released for DVD, which is something that could be readily found on IMDb. It had its own theatrical release. I didn't like the fact that the movie is on DVD and can only be seen by people that have a special VHS system, which, as a movie reviewer, I don't really consider to be much more than a curiosity, as it is not really an all-day affair, and certainly not a blockbuster.  We could use this as a marketing tool for the movie by using the movie as our own film festival. (The best way to really explore the film is in it's current state and not in the original film.)    In conclusion, while this is certainly the longest movie out of the three, it does have it's merits.  It has an ending that has relevance to the plot as it relates to "The Secret of Sassy" (we have the original ending of the movie for reference.)  It was shot on location in the former Yugoslavia, as there is an abundance of old Yugoslavian film making equipment and it does depict the ruins of the old Yugoslavia, which had a significant influence on the plot and the characters in the previous version of this film, so we get to see a bit more of the "little Yugoslavia" that was so important in the earlier version, and we have seen the film before, and had the pleasure of seeing the movie in a theater.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend and I saw this movie on the TV in L. We all know how that can be good. It's been said here and I agree it was on TV that it wasn't bad and I can say with total honesty that a bunch of our "regular" friends found it in a movie theater in L, and my friend's girlfriend even got a "special" movie ticket to see this on the Friday afternoon. I don't know what our regular friends see that's so terrible to the point that they can't sit through it. The first time I saw the movie, I was actually quite fascinated by this project and my love for it, and I wanted it to get finished in the end. With the big budget the movie is obviously not as "small" and even though it's a low budget version of the production, I can't believe it will get completed by the time it comes out. I mean, it is a pretty big movie, and you could argue that they have to have a "short" ending, which is pretty bad, because that is when the director gets to work with all the good, young actors (although, they are very good) and try to get the best out of them. The worst thing is that this movie isn't so much a "movie" as it is an "entire work" which means they want to just get it done and finish it. To give you an idea, we don't even know what they were doing with the story at the beginning of this whole movie (if it was going to be a whole film, which would probably be more realistic for us to digest, and why they were all looking at the ending credits as if they had some story or some kind of movie to go along with it). It's basically a whole story that hasn't been made into a movie (with all due respect to this movie's "originality").

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days ago, when I caught it on Showtime, the first thing I thought was, "This is a remake."   It's called "Hogan's Heroes" because it's on Showtime.  I thought I would find out more about the film before I go to the theater. So I was a little excited about seeing this film, knowing what it was about, that it was a remake of a film that was very similar to "Sudden Impact." So I don't think it would be a good movie if I knew about what was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on DVD and I was hoping it would be a comedy about two guys with a chemistry teacher. My god!

The animation is extremely bad, and looks like something you could draw on a napkin. I don't know why you would watch this movie as a kid. The only good thing about it was the kids are little. It's for a kid's movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that this film has been out for quite a while, and my opinion is that it is the standard fare of a movie with a very small cast, and a limited budget to be able to really make a "breakthrough" with this movie. I'm not one of those Hollywood types to see this film as some sort of "drama" (or I suppose as a "art-film" or a "documentary"). The movie just continues its "pointed-to-the-camera" approach, which is the same as the rest of the film. There's no real "feel" to this movie... It's almost like I have been in a movie before. And it is a very difficult movie to watch for all involved, for many reasons.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I like the movie. I'm a huge film buff, I am from France and I love to watch movies.  One of my favorites is "Hunchback of Notre Dame" and I'm sure it's on my list of favorite movies. In "Pleasantville", the movie is not actually in Pleasantville (or it's not on the DVD) but it's closest to it in the real Pleasantville. The main reason for the film not being there is that the actors who played the two main characters (Iain) left town.  This, too, can be considered part of the film, but they were still in the town of Pleasantville at the time when "Plemmantville" was made.  As far as the film's production goes, the Pleasantville actors were hired, not in their new homes in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, at first I was really mad about how awful this was, and I would like to have seen this movie in the cinema in the early 1990's. I'm glad that the original version was made for home video release, because I would love to see the original "Somewhere In Time" version available for viewing.  There are some people out there who still claim that this movie is an original production. I really don't think that's true, either. It looks like the movie was made on a fairly recent home video production.

A number of things have come up, some of which were not in the movie, such as the 'new' island that was built for the movie and the fact that the island was only one metre high, which leads to the idea that the 'lost' island is located in the middle of the island, the first island is 'lost'. (That's why I said that I saw the movie at the beginning, to show how we might find this island). I'll have to research that particular theory and see if I find it. It's just bizarre.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't understand why I bought this film. I've just been reading the reviews, and there are a number of reviewers in the film, and some have said they have seen it, or they've just seen it on TV and been in it, and they've seen it in Toronto, and it's pretty good! Some of the actors have good comic roles and they have really been good in this filmbutbutit's not as good as a movie like "Tears of the Rain".  It's not bad enough that people may say it.  This is probably the film that most people have seen. It's a short film, like "I was just on the streets" or a feature film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the most important thing is for all of you to understand this was a student film. When you get to see the finished product I have a hard time believing that a director would have been entrusted with such a low budget, so bad special effects, bad dialogue, bad acting and it's all over within the first 20 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a poor film that really wants to shock, disgust and shock the hell out of you! If you have been in a bad scene before, you know that when you see something that is supposed to be the same thing that you really don't care to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    That's not just a guy's opinion, that's a guy, and so was he the one who wrote the review. He actually wrote an entirely new review for this movie, and when he was writing his review, he seemed to love the movie. I'm pretty sure he loved it.butbutbut but he seems to have had some bad memories. As I've already said, this is an adult film, and he's supposed to remember his own shortcomings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was expecting it to be really really bad...it is called a movie, and I guess I am not really in touch with movies. It's just that the movie itself is very low quality. I will say that the end of the movie is really funny, it has the scene where the kids go to see Santa Claus, so it's funny to watch. I am a huge fan of the final scene, with the little boy at the North Pole. I think that it's also worth looking at for the end credits, it will be there for the last time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been an advocate of independent films or films made in a time when the American market was saturated with major Hollywood films (this is the only one I've seen in my life). I did watch a few others that I liked. I did think, and still consider, that these were more interesting films for a comedy.  They're not.  The "good" reviews are not only from "fans" but are from the "artistic" or "spiritual" aspects of the film, and while they are only about two minutes long, they may be able to tell a more interesting story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only person in the theater is my daughter, who's older than the rest of us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film begins with the premise that one "very famous" actor has committed suicide. We are told that it is a "very, very, very good actor". That would make the film much more like an hour-and-a-half movie than the hour-long film that it had been originally. Unfortunately, I'm a fan of this actor, and would like him to appear on film for an hour or so at least-- and of course he has made appearances on films that were much longer than this one-- and so to have him appear in this film was quite "old hat", at least as far as the film that I saw, and I would like to see him appear on a film that was more like the film he's in right now, and one that was longer and more serious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It didn't really bother me that much in the beginning and there, I'm a girl with short hair and I don't think it would make my hair go grey.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For the love of god, if you can, don't watch this film. I was able to get a copy of the DVD after it had come out, and that's my take on it; the only film I got to see it in, and I've seen it in my mind, the director, Jay Mohr, made me look like I was really in demand. I'm in demand! It's not that it was bad (if that's the case, I can't remember that it's ever been made in a movie). I was embarrassed. I think this is a pretty terrible movie from the beginning. If you can watch it, watch it on an actual set. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think there was any hope. I went back to the film to find some way to justify that, I really think the director should apologize to the director of "The Notebook." The ending was pretty bad, too. It's as though they were really trying to put on some sort of emotional performance. The kids in this are cute, and that's what makes them cute to watch on TV. I just think there really is no real reason for them to act in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to have an opinion about a great movie that was made by John Ford, the "The Man in the Moon" was made before John Ford was even in town. I really thought I was going to see a true remake, because this film is a remake of "The Day the Earth Stood Still", an independent film produced by Gary Merrill and Gary Busey. I would say that it's not a great film, if you want to watch a documentary with an interview about a real person who is responsible for that film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a low budget, poorly made movie. I'm not one to complain about bad movies, it's just another piece of 'low budget' 'low quality' 'budget' film, so if you want to be taken seriously, take your money elsewhere, or rent this on DVD or rent it on Amazon, or a similar'special' release (as it's not that great either).  I would, without hesitation recommend that if you are willing to waste another hour of your life to see this movie, if it was in the theater, to rent it or see it on the video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film several times. The fact that it's the third time I have seen this movie is rather perplexing, not to mention that I've actually been looking for this film for the past couple of weeks in the DVD section of my local video store (a rare film). It's been in the "other" section, and when you do see it, it's in the bargain bin. I did like the original "Holes In Space" short, and some of the actors in that movie. In fact, this film is not worth renting. It's simply the first film in the series, just like all three of the previous movies. I have a feeling I was the only one in my school to actually rent this, and so I feel bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out on DVD. A woman friend of mine, who is a film editor and has seen my movie before, was my film teacher, and he told me that this is a movie for "amateurs".  I'm pretty sure that most of the movie was made up on film. The only "good" comment I read in the book was that there would be an "intimate" movie. I wish that was true. There are some interesting parts about the relationship between the main character and the main heroine. It would be interesting to see the end result of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It starts out with the idea of a musical. It doesn't make sense. It's so hard to get the audience to look at it. This film was a big success at the box office. It had a lot of money at my local video store to make it's just really depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off in a pretty good place. It starts off with the classic "How do you get into the movie." I have always wanted to be in the film. It would have to be about 20 minutes before the movie begins, which I found to be the time the movie was going to open. I thought the movie would be a really good comedy in its own right. It is not a comedy. This movie is a very poorly made comedy. I think the movie is supposed to be a comedy, but if the movie had been a comedy that wasn't in a comic book format, I would have rated it much lower. I was glad to see that there is a "Hercules in Hercules" movie. I enjoyed that, and I thought that the movie really does make fun of Hercules and his family. If there is something that the Gods could bless, it would be making this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise was the funniest and most logical, I'd think this film is a comedy, in all seriousness. The other actors, which are not known to be serious, are just terrible. In one scene (it's not a big one, in fact it's only the very beginning of the movie), I actually broke out laughing hysterically.  I just had to sit there and see them, and then I just couldn't take it and I stopped watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could be considered a comedy, for all that. I think people that were fans of the first movie would be very excited about a comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors who portrayed the main character in this movie were quite good when they made the movie for two hours.  The movie is a fairly typical romantic comedy--a guy in love, and a girl in love...and the movie does end with the hero going to a big city, as well as a scene of some of the other guys going to big city--we're talking about the same movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love Italian horror, I love them in the late '80s and early '90s. I love the late Italian cinema "The Vampire" and the late German cinema "Der Vampire," I am very grateful for those films. I would like to thank all of them. I hope the new "Vampires" remake will also be shown in Italian. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just finished watching "The Godfather," which was one of the best movies ever made and it was released on DVD. I watched this movie on VHS at the bargain bin (which is not a bargain) and it didn't take off the way it could have. It's bad! I could only finish it because I was very tired and I didn't get a really good sense of what was going on, so I thought it was okay for a family to enjoy it. I thought I could laugh at it and do some stuff in it.  I thought this is one of those movies where you can go in and just enjoy it for the laughs. The director is a real genius, if he could somehow figure out how to fix it. My guess is he doesn't like the idea of having to think about how to make a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what the people out there are supposed to think because they are the victims of a terrible movie. It was funny at some point that this movie was a comedy. This movie was completely forgettable and boring. There was no real reason for me to even watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was that of "How to survive in the wild", a "survival guide" type of thing. I mean really. The movie is more about survival (and, at times, is just about survival) than survival for wild animals. (I don't know if the writer and director really intended to turn the movie into a film about wild animals because, for example, to turn it into a horror film would just be really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My friends and I have been trying to find some friends to take us to this movie. The "friends" have never been around, I have never heard them speak. My favorite cast member is Paul Sorvino, he was good in some of the short films. I just want to see them in one-on-one situation, since they are so important in the "Silent Hill" series. They should have some help from this little "film" they have made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the only one who sees the movie. It will be interesting to know how it was actually received. If you're a regular reviewer, you'll get a sneak preview of it, so you can imagine how some people reacted to it being one of the movies to have your child watch in the future. If that ever happens, you might be surprised at how people are treated in this film, and how it's not an innocent movie about the poor innocent little child who's mind will be opened to the idea that they're evil, even though this movie could've had an innocence message that would've been better understood by a lot of people, as it was written and intended, the message it gives is pretty clear to see, that if you're not very well off, you're going to go to hell, and that's it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, we can't say we're very serious about these guys in a military setting, so what? They're supposed to be the guys who're supposed protect the U.  This This This movie, the guys are supposed to protect them, not to have a serious conflict with the other guy, as the movie progresses, they really try to become one.  The main character, Nick (the lead in this movie) is a good guy, who doesn't really like to hurt people, as he's been hurt in the past. He even gets a job at the department, where he gets an assignment to protect a policeman, where I think he would get a few moments to do that. In the end, they're really trying to be one. That would be the first and main character that's being attacked, where you see them fighting the guy who's supposed to have killed them. The first half of the movie is very much the same as in "The Naked Gun". The one scene where Nick and Nick are separated from each other is about a few seconds long, and they're running for their lives.  That's all. That's their story. They're getting to know each other, like in other movies, and the only real change in the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, they don't want it to be the worst. They wanted me to find out if I liked this movie. It's not good in any way, it's like a horror movie, a movie made by a bunch of people in the 20s. My wife and I went to the film for the first time, in the theater, and we loved it. So, do yourself a favor and watch it on TV, on VHS, or rent it on VH1 or TV Land, and just see what people make of it, we'll know what to do. I do want to say that the film has a lot of good footage, and people who have seen it, so I'm curious what they think of this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found out that they were looking for "Ethan" and not "Erik" (or maybe they didn't notice it was actually me when they contacted them)    This is my last "movie" because my health keeps changing, and I am not a very happy person.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did like the book and was happy to be in the British movie "The Last Unicorn" which came out about 10 years before my birth. It was based on the novel. The original "The Little White Horse" was made in 1959 and I can only remember it being about 10-15 years old.   It was a movie based on a novel about a boy who was about 7 years old in the novel and I have seen the original film. I am also familiar with the book, I read it at age 9 and was under the spell of a librarian as my mother's librarian mother did with me. I saw the movie the other night and it was based not on a book, not even on the screen. The little horse, the Little White Horseshoe, the little white hound, and the little pink one, the pink one with the white ears was not even in the movie when they were going to show me, the movie ended up getting a re-run at the local library and I saw it there. And the little girl with the red bow, the one with brown hair, and she is now about 4 years old, was the pink girl at the library. This little one is 2 years old at the time of this review and I didn't see it. All of the little animals got a second chance to be on the "Little White Horse", which I didn`t even know existed and that little girl got another chance to appear.  I thought it was the other day when the little boy was killed that the little one didn`T get one because it had the red shirt and it had to do a second time. So when the Little Little Horse got killed, I didn `t see the little Little Little Girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend of mine, who has seen several good movies in the past (and I believe, in this movie, has been given the name "Mr. Yerdo", is telling me that this is what Yerdos himself calls a "movie", which is probably a little extreme--I know he's not the most talented person or anything.  You might expect him to be able to do some good comedy--and it's his third time doing "Crazy Movie", he's probably already aware of the fact that he might have to do a lot more than just "Happily Ever After" with this film. He really hasn't developed a new character, in the best sense of the word--they're completely mismatched to the film.  I'm not sure if it was a writer's decision, or the film's--the film is trying to make an over-the-top film, and I honestly don't know whether that was the intention--I don't think anyone at Warner Bros. had the guts to show that film to anyone--I couldn't even watch it for 10 minutes--and to be honest, I was so furious when I saw it, I wasn't even halfway through the film... I couldn't take it anymore.  The movie was so terrible--it is an embarrassment to everything it tries to be. I was stunned by how bad it is--it's so unbelievably terrible, it's beyond embarrassing. I didn't even take any pleasure watching this movie--there is no humor, no value to this "movie". I can't recommend it--I've seen what it was like, I know it's bad--there are movies like that, or some really bad movies...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good reviewer should comment on a good movie (a good one, one that I think was made in Hollywood) this movie is one of many awful, pointless movies that are made for the good of mankind. The only reason I watch this movie was for the ending credits and that credits are what the credits were made of (so I don't know how the film ended up in my local video store). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are some who claim that it is a conspiracy and will ruin people's lives, or something like that, which in their minds makes it a true movie. But at the end of the day, the people who think they can stop the movie will be just as unsuccessful as those who made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the movie opens, you have this idea that you are going to see a great American film.  This movie is a mess. The movie is very low budget (for example, the actors are actually wearing their normal clothes) the movie is boring. If you want to know why, I recommend watching it on video. You don't get any entertainment from it. This is the reason why they call it an independent film. It's so bad and horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found out recently that this movie was supposed to have "The Best of All" at some point, so I will give this movie the same rating I gave "The Amazing Spiderman 2". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, with an unpretentious cast, is about a man who, according to his book, will be killed by the Romans (as it is now).  I'm not going to lie, I have to say, if you've seen the book or watched the show, you've had to deal with some incredibly good actors in this show. But now that they're out of town (for this film, anyway), and are on vacation, I'm still sad to see them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not going to be a long movie, like the original one.  The other people have done movies that have lasted much longer. This is not even the best film in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really only for educational purposes, and it is sad to see it become a film that I did not find the interest in watching, and the acting is very poor, and there is not much suspense at all, and I really thought that this was just a short film that would get lost somewhere, like other people have commented. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went out to a movie: a few years back, and went out with my friends and we watched a movie.  It was pretty good, with Christopher Walken, Sean Penn and Robert Downey Jr, and one guy in particular named Paul Rubens (I think) and he came from the film "The Third Man").  It also had an ending where some guy got shot, and that was pretty neat.  I was also curious about the ending where there were two guys shooting each other at the end, and ended up getting killed by Walken and some girl. I would like to say something to the guys who got this movie and give them a "heads up" or whatever, this ending was very predictable. The way the ending was handled is the equivalent of the ending to the "Halloween horror" flick.   A sequel would have been the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the television show (and was a show runner on it), which was a few years back. This movie was basically two guys making a movie with my money...I really didn't know what to expect, and the guy who I rented the movie from had said that this would be a comedy, and I thought that was really the only movie I would rent from this guy...he said that he would try to make it funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based in Seattle and not the Pacific Northwest. The film is about a Seattle couple, Ed and Lorraine. The couple meets in the end of a movie that takes place in a small, rural community in southern Mexico, in a community called "Avila" in Baja California.  The community itself is quite small and the film's ending takes place somewhere between the town and the community and goes to Mexico instead of Seattle. In the end, the movie tries to be as accurate as possible in the relationship between the characters. I think that it would be a lot more realistic to portray Ed and his wife and their "love story" as it takes place between Ed and the woman who appears in the film, the "love boat" that takes the name "Ariel." It takes place where the real boat does not take place and I think would be more appropriate for the final scene of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very lucky to get one movie, so I can say that I'm an American-born Canadian (a guy who has been to Canada and Canada has been in the US) so I'm not from a Canadian cultural place.  I really wanted to see this movie, but I'm in no way a movie director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, you can get away with using the TV remote control (unless the actors' performances are so great), which is what I got, although the movie was so good that the actors were good, and it's the same for them, it wasn't because I was "in the mood" or something else (unless I was a total freak).  This film is so disappointing, I can't understand what the actors saw. They're all in the same frame, just actors and they just don't seem to be trying to be as believable as the "perfectionists". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very sad movie. I think it's pretty scary if the other kids are around...  I mean, it does get scary when the other girls and mom and friends are in the house... that's pretty good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of good actors in this movie, and I'll give them a few points. I thought some of the other reviews were going to talk about how great the actors are and that there were two of them on this movie. There are only two. The other person is in the movie and is not in the credits. This is an independent film, which is a shame because it should be, but it's also unfortunate that the directors didn't seem to be completely sure what their intentions were and to trust their own instincts. And that's not all. I watched this movie over the course of two months, and during that time I only saw a few hours of footage. My first impression was that I'd be watching a short film with the credits going around in big letters, showing the good actors that are on this film. They would be my ideal candidates for this film, people that know a lot about filmmaking.  The second time I saw it, I thought this is a comedy.  In the end, I found out that I was wrong and that I actually had to sit in the front row. I found it to be a sad and depressing film that doesn't do anything for me emotionally. I will admit that it's not bad. I would like to see the ending and what this movie will really be about. There is a young woman and a few young men that are actually very young.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a horror comedy. And, because of the nature of the horror genre, the acting is horrible. I think that it was a great idea to go into it and get some kind of education about how this is supposed to be done. It was a comedy about how a kid got into the "black hat" world and I think there's no one in this world who really knows how to act as a "black guy". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, for the most part, features a group of young people who live in their parents' apartment, some of them. There's no real story. There are some good points about the movie "The Third Man" about a young man in love with a young woman in the mid-1950s, who meets and falls in love. The young woman has great lines that could have been used here. The old couple have some great lines as they reminisce about their lives in the 20's. You just have to think about it and the film does get a "post-modern" treatment--a guy's life and a woman's life--it's all about romance. I don't think it's for the "new wave" of film makers to make this film--it really was made for the 20th Century film buffs. This is just about the "mature" film fanatics. It was a "majestic" film made in 1946 and is about a guy's journey, as a young boy, into the desert--a man's journey to find his way home, not an independent film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third attempt to revive this film and a bad, bad, and bad movie about a time when I saw this on television, as well as a horrible version of this today. The whole premise of this movie is the best idea ever andbutbutbutwhen it's come out on DVD it'll be a different story because you have to imagine what happened to the actors and the storyteller. The characters are terrible and they've got a real tough one coming up.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are all so pretty. I really didn't mind at all about their makeup.  I think their costumes are really good, especially the red ones for the film. The red outfit for the movie is actually not very stylish and just looks like a frilly top with the red top for the character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In addition to the negative review that I have in the movie, I would like to mention that I watched the film with a friend (who was kind of a fan of the movie) on a cable channel in Canada.  The film was not shown on cable at all (the only Canadian show it was shown on was during the film festival), and since it was just the trailer and I didn't know it was going to be in the original run or had a run in the theatre, I was really hoping that I would be able to get some time in the theater for it. The film itself was just released in the U.S. I was very interested to find out how it was received by American audiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really sorry, that people are upset about this film. They should be really angry about how this film came out. People in the early reviews seemed to be saying this was a movie for people who loved Shakespearean film. This isn't a film of a "Hamlet" or even "Henry V" film. "Hamlets" is very different.  It's not about the death of Arthur, it's about the end of this person's life. "Henry VI" is about the reign, "Henry VII" is the reign of Edward, this is about his funeral.  The king dies and this person is being cremated. The funeral is about Edward IV's family members.   "Henry VIII" is being celebrated in a much more public place. It's about his brother, the Duke of Clarence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a comedy, but if you're a serious person, you might be able to see this as something that was a part of my comedy career, and maybe they wouldn't try to make this as a serious comedy, so you got to enjoy my last few movies that were comedy-oriented. I'll never get that chance again. The only thing that is funny is my own "Hulk" character, which I've played in several movies. Also, I liked the humor of "HW" in "HULK SMASH," so I'll be able see that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to do what I can in the future with this film and hope that I didn't go too crazy with it and that it at least had some good quality reviews that were written about it. This film is a mess, the film starts off with a couple of really great interviews with people who are involved in the documentary and a lot of them are still alive and I'll do my best to not spoil them. I'm a huge fan of John Walsh, one of the directors of the documentary (one of the stars in the film) and I'm sure that his interviews with this documentary director were absolutely fantastic (he didn't give me this film) this film is completely lost on the big picture of what's really going on in this movie. I can't even go on camera without an idea of what I was going to talk about and I find that it's a documentary with the sole purpose to get the movie made. I found the entire film to be an un-enjoyable experience and I didn  not recommend it. I give it a 2 out of 10 (I really wanted to give it an even rating) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good thing about this movie is that it is based on a true story, so that it may be interesting to explore the story of a great director like Alfred Hitchcock.  There is a great castbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutwe have yet to really discover what we should do in this film, which is a fairly predictable thriller with a bad script that is a result of what might have been the director having no real clue what he was doing, and this is not due to anything that I can see as a result I just wanted to tell you, for anyone that wants to know, that this is a film I would recommend someone else have made. It should have been made in the year 2000. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we reviewed the first one I thought, since they have more resources, we're going to be able to give the other guys some love and just show them how to survive.  We really don't know where the guy was for almost 30 minutes of the film. It was all the way at the end of the movie that we learned he was a policeman. It's been shown in other shows before, police are not that great at hiding and in hiding. There is also the question of why did they try to hide themselves in the middle of the desert when they didn't have to at first? This was a very stupid film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this film was ever intended to be such a serious film. This is what I call a serious horror comedy--but only because some people saw it as a serious movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see the movie being a "comedy" because it's kind of "a comedy" about a bunch of really really attractive people. I can also see the film being a comedy about an "actor of little" or "an actor who is just playing a role" or being an "actioner" (whatever that means). And I like action movies. I think it's interesting to see these guys at the "edge" of their careers because it makes them look out of place as they try to "act like a Hollywood hero" and it's probably because they're from Canada in a big way and the American media doesn't really like Canada or really know who we are as people. They'll probably think we're bad or dumb for acting Canadian-style and it might make the Canadian media and audiences like us less in the film and it will make Canadian film-goers see Canadian actors as bad-at-acting American.   This movie is not very good by any stretch of the imagination, although I've seen it in "full" and I really enjoyed some of the performances of some of our actors in this movie, not just on the screen. It just seems to be a huge mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've written more about the "good" side of the movie, and have seen this movie on TCM, TCM Channel, TCF, TCW and TCM Network, so I've seen the good reviews, and am a big fan of the good "movie" genre, and of the late great director, Paul Verhoeven. He's the one I feel the need to comment on. This movie, which is apparently made to be the next Verhoeve Verhoevel Verhoevendam, should be banned. It's just a movie, the kind of movie that, for those who like the movies that "matter", is not a "serious" film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have seen "The Naked Gun" or the "Final Solution," you know this is the end. No one will be left alive.   I was a child when this movie came out. It is the kind of movie I would have loved as a child. I was really hoping it would be a horror film, maybe a movie that would try to scare people.  It is so disappointing. I give this a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really, really terrible.  The director is either too old or too young, I could care less about it.  There are also some pretty awful, unbelievable characters and a pretty, really bad plot. I'm sure it's just a stupid movie and I didn't even catch some of the things happening in the movie (maybe this was the movie "The House of the Dead" with Jack Frost/Jack Frost Jr. or something). I can't really see how anyone could possibly come close to making this movie a success. It's really sad and awful, and if anyone should make this film, I'd advise you to try to kill yourself and then get it taken care of by some very talented, talented and talented people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie, first of all, for entertainment. I am a movie lover.   It was a really good time to watch. The only reason I would suggest anyone to watch this movie is because it was shot in South America, when I was there last time. I saw the movie in Argentina, and I loved it. When I saw this one I butchered it, it was bad. I don't want people to think I'm a bad person, or that this is because I'm old. I'm 48 years old, I grew up with this movie. So it's bad to have an old movie with a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are really no redeeming points whatsoever. No redeeming point whatsoever. I'm not ashamed to say that I was embarrassed to be a fan of the first "Superman".  The only thing that I could do in that very short time was to walk away after I'd watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would think it is the worst movie of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To say that I really cared about this film would be the understatement. I've been a part of this industry for years and my opinion on this film is the opinion of someone that watched it for 10 minutes at the mall on Saturday afternoon. It really was a very poor film and I don't really know how I can justify buying a single movie of this kind in my lifetime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care what anyone says about this movie. I watched this film because it was a film that was coming out and I loved that film. And I didn't see it in the way that this was directed. They just want their viewers to forget about the previous film, because this film was released in November of 1988 (or the year of the previous movie) and they thought that most people would remember the last film. The cast and I were put on the same boat after the previous one. What a waste. The actors had better hair and makeup and they looked better (I know they were in their prime). If I didn.t think they were really hot looking, they were hot in the other film and they would have looked great in their new roles. And in my mind the movie has no redeeming value whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty low budget production that does not have the greatest skill in the art or writing or anything like that. In fact, there are some things you would consider to be for such a low budget film. The whole movie is sort of like "a look at the future." I did catch a glimpse of it, which is from a few minutes into the movie and so I'm not sure exactly when the film will be available online or to rent. As you would expect, there is nothing like a major production like a movie, with production values that you might be accustomed to seeing on a major Hollywood production with an epic story line and full of beautiful, gorgeous women (you'd have a hard time finding this film in the movie rental stores).  It's an absolutely terrible movie to watch. The reason why I'm writing this review in the first place. There is absolutely nothing in the world that justifies the amount of money or the time that was invested into making this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not a movie about a movie that would be about a good guy or a bad guy. I did not like the guy with the black beard or the guy who was a cowboy. And that's just me. The movie was mostly filmed in the San Francisco bay area where I live (I do not know why the movie was in Mexico) and I don't understand how they were able to film in Mexico because Mexico is right in between the states of San Francisco and the Bay area of San Mateo. It's an hour-and-a-half drive from my home town San Jose! (the whole film would have been in the bay area, and my wife and I would have missed this part!). There was a huge "scene" in the center of the city, at the corner of Market Street and Fillmore Street, where a small town, in Mexico, was being filmed, where they filmed a few people in their underwear. There is a huge town that surrounds Mexico. It seemed they were attempting to film the "scene in Mexico" for the entire film! (I am not sure if they were trying to capture the beautiful view of the sunset, or if they filmed the whole city or what!). This was ridiculous. I don;t think that you would recognize Mexico from this film and it is ridiculous to have been made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing that comes out of this film is the conclusion of a book. In this film, there is not enough time to do the things that the book is very good at. The book is a long novel, with different scenes. And it is very difficult to watch the movie as it stands now. It seems to be shot with a budget that was very high. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to say exactly how it got to New York, but it's hard not to think that the people who have to make this movie got to see anything like it, nor do they deserve any of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I've watched the movie twice now, and it is quite good. Some of the supporting characters, like the supporting actors, are really good. I was hoping for at least a new movie of this film and a few good roles for this film to return with the other actors.  There are actually two supporting characters in this film. One is in the film, and is played by the "Lone Ranger" (Mark Dacascos). He is the Lone Ranger, who was a good actor, and could still have done a good job in this movie. The other is played very poorly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand. Why was the kid in the movie? I hope it gets some answers before I spend my money. I know I've seen it in the cinema. I'm a big fan. I love the idea of this moviebut unfortunately, the kid is in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I had heard this film was good for children, and that I could watch an adult movie, so it might be something like a 15-year-old film. I thought that it would be a good satire on the adult industry. I might actually like it, it was not that bad of a film, but I think a lot of people still find this film a bit shocking or disturbing in the minds of younger viewers.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to watch it because I want to watch something good in it, and what a bad film is. I don't know if I was at home, but I watched it when I was with my parents and my parents still like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember the movie (the one where I was 15) and I like that movie a lot. I was even invited to play in it.  As a matter of fact I found this movie to be incredibly bad at all. It could have been the worst thing ever, and it could be the worst movie of all time, it was the worst film of all the movies in my opinion. There are good things about this movie, like a bunch of teenagers, who would act like teenagers, and maybe a few girls that act like girls. I love them and I think they're cute. Maybe they're really bad actors for this movie or something to do with the script and they're trying to make you think this is a movie about them. They're like a kid in the beginning.  I'm a father.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this film knowing the name and knew what was about the movie. The first reviewer I'm sure would be happy that I just went into a horror flick. The other reviewer knows the film in the sense of what a horror movie is about. He probably would be upset by the movie, the reason for that being because he's been reading about horror movies, he knows horror movies as a genre, which is a horror film, not the bad version of it. The bad director was a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good movie is supposed to be just about how an ordinary person would act and so that's the only movie I watch from this movie because I thought it could at least be a true review about this movie, maybe it was worth giving it more than it's rating of 1 out of 10 for its first 15 minutes and to watch some other movies that were pretty good. The first 15 min were just about a teenager in his underwear and that's just for fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the first movies that had this kind of relationship, when the two men were friends and got their share of "witty" jokes.  The reason for this is that they were not yet married.  It's all a mess of people in a very bad movie, and it looks like a very awful movie, so don't be surprised if you've to see the movie with a crowd of people, you'd think it's some kind of a comedy or something else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The guy who directed this is a real talent. There's no reason for this movie to be made. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The guy who wrote and directed the movie comes off as the guy who came out to see it. He doesn't try to act. He comes off like he's acting in a sitcom. He does a pretty good job of portraying the general aspects of being a doctor, like caring for patients and working on medical research. It's good that he's still able to be funny in his role as the psychiatrist, because the doctor-in-training isn't supposed to be a laughing-stock, because we want to know if he's mad or sane, and the role of the psychiatrist is supposed to make the doctor seem intelligent and normal, and he should be able to do something with his character that makes him seem like a proper medical student.  The psychiatrist's first meeting with Dr. Gartner is really weird in the movie (as Gartners doctor would have Dr. Klima meet her); Dr. Moore is in the same room as Garting, for God's sake, and it would've been a little too obvious, so we know that this is the first time Moore and Gartning talk to each other in the hospital room, in his case.   I was actually able to watch Gart-Moore's first scene with Moore's mother on the show, which was on TV in Season 6. And it wasn't a very good doctor-patient relationship, as I'm sure Moore has a really big problem with it. I'm not sure what kind of character Gartings father-to-be would have with his own son, and Moore is completely absent from Dr. Wills first meeting.  It's just a weird little scene between Moore and Wills. You really don't get to know any of these people; in the end, Dr. Wilson and Dr. Davis come to look more and more like doctors; Gartins is the guy of the show. We see a doctor-like face, and so far I like how it doesn't look like you're going to find out that Gartingham is a doctor at the end of this movie, because it doesn"t affect his personality so negatively, because you'd have to come up with that theory and show the doctor himself. You don't really get to learn anything new about anyone. Garts is portrayed as a doting son, while Dr. Martin, who's been on the "Psych" show, is portrayed, in the first scene, as a completely different
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of bad special effects. They use an over-sized camera which is set in a studio, which was designed for a large budget. There are other bad actors, such as Leslie Caron, who plays the villain, a sad guy who is supposed to be so sad and lovable, so he can actually act a lot of emotions. He seems to be a bit of a masochist.  There's also a little boy with a similar child-like haircut and facial hair to him who plays his daughter, which is another kid whose acting is reminiscent of a girl in an adult's body.  This film isn't about a child's film or children's film, it's about an adult, adult, male, male-centered, gay, lesbian, transgendered, and straight film directed by an adult (who obviously didn't consider his kids when making this film) for adults to be viewing with their children, which has all the makings of a horrible "specially for kids" type of film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as the movie was at the local video store, I'd say that about 80% of the movie is about the life of a typical single mother in the 1980s. It is hard to say that there wasn't enough time to explore the world and find out more about the people of the time, especially if there was any life out there, or life as it was pre-technology, at least for the pre-cannibalistic period of history. If I had any time at all, I would make this movie into a true historical piece about the various cultures in the world, with some research and a good deal of "diversity" among the actors.  But I digress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not an idiot (I have been through this movie) and the idea that this movie is going to be a comedy is absurd. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, if you think this film will go straight into a home video store or video store (like I did) then, that is, a "B" rating for the film. Second, the movie "Crouching Tiger" was released in 1985. That is my last exposure to the "C" rating, so the two are very different. In this review I am going to give this movie the "B," because that is the only rating that I can give it.  The reason why I can only give it the "A" is because there is an extra scene (the one that takes place during the final dance scene, which is really not the end of the world) and there is a scene that takes up about ten minutes of my life that would take up five minutes in the "c" rating and another scene that is completely unnecessary and stupid. The other scenes don't even make sense. It was not very well made. It's as if they had to have their actors go in with an attitude that they had something to prove...  The dance scene was one of the best scenes, it had to do with how the characters were portrayed. You know, the one where they danced, and I think they were happy. This was one scene where a good actor would've had a lot of fun dancing with it, and danced the "Rhapsody" with it... And there are a lot more dances in the film that I know of, even if we're talking about the old "Witch Hunter" dance scene.  I have seen some people on the "net" say that this is one of my favorite dance scenes. There were dances, dance scenes, and the "Olympic scene," I'm very confident of saying that the movie wasn't really that great either. The "Widow Hunter" was one that had a very pretty face, and a pretty face alone, it was really a nice story for this dance sequence and they tried to recreate that scene in the dance scene at some point during the film... Well, a lot better than they did here, it should say something about how they did the dance scenes in this film that are supposed to tell you who is dancing with whom, because it's not really all that nice or nice... The same goes for the scenes where a man dances with a woman or vice versa, or when the "Tiger Dance" is shown... It looks so "real" as well as a lot
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember the time in my junior high school when our teacher told us to read a book about how to be a teacher, which is what the movie was supposed to be. The movie's director and producer, Michael Winner, was the head of the drama department when the movie came out. He's the person who had to make the decision on who to hire. The people who wrote this movie, I'm sorry, have made the movie. They've butchered it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing about this movie is that it was directed by a woman. That doesn't help that this movie was made in the last few days. I mean it's a really terrible movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the way they did some of the movies in the 30's and 40's.  I think the way the show is on tonight, or the way it was on CBS was actually the way I was led to believe.  We begin at the beginning with a character named Mr. Allen. He seems to be from the 30s, when the show was created in the 80's. It also seems that he is from the South, which is strange, considering how many people of his generation were of African descent (it's true that it's not a black and white show, and people of color in the show were the ones who were cast, but at the time of this writing, there seems to have been no racial conflict at all in the first 10 minutes of the show, which should be jarring to viewers.  It seems to start with a discussion of the character's past, which was in this episode of "The Fugitive" where it is said that "the Fugitive had gone south and he wasn't allowed to have a gun."  And then we get introduced to our main character, who is played by the character Mr. Thompson. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was interested in finding out how this movie will help my career as a filmmaker, in order to have this movie as a training film for aspiring movie-makers (which I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to ask the director), as someone who wants to create films that have artistic merit. I really cannot fathom this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is only one thing in this movie that could possibly have been called a true adventure. This movie is not an adventure movie at all, a movie about a man who is an engineer and is going through his life with only two close friends (one who is supposed to be a movie-maker and the other is supposed go into the movie).   If there is any true meaning to this movie, the only one that I feel is worth the time and energy is the story of the life of engineer/engineer-designer/engineering-writer, Richard Matheson, who is still alive, in which the movie was meant to go and is a real story to go into. I think that the film was meant only to portray engineer/designer-writer Mathesons life, which could have been told in a comedy-drama like 'The Adventures of Tinker Bell.' There is really no way to justify the movie as an actual movie. The movie just seems like a complete waste of time and money. I rate this movie at least a 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the film was very boring and there were no surprises for the director, so it makes no sense. Even the best actor in the world can overcome it and I found myself feeling bad for wanting to watch this because I just felt compelled to watch it.  I highly recommend you don't watch this at work, it's a pity I have seen it on the DVD because if it doesn't scare you or bring any enjoyment to your mind, then don't waste your time on it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping that I would be in the "good old days", like the '60's, when movies were made for and about women. There was a great film in my mind and one I would enjoy. But this is the movie that was done in an hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this movie at the San Francisco International Film Festival and even the San Diego film festival. I've had the privilege of seeing this, first on DVD, and then again at a festival screening. I must say that my own reviews are always the most honest with my own personal feelings and opinions, and those were in this movie, as I'm sure they will be in the festival version.  I really want to say that I'm a real fan of the San Fran film, and that my friends and my wife will be getting their passes for this one. I was shocked that this movie wasn't in the "Special Features" of this DVD. I'm not a filmmaker who doesn't understand how film festivals work or even how "special" this festival was. It's just a movie. It isn't meant to be a horror film, nor is it meant to break any new ground in the genre. And that's not my fault either. It didn't take long to realise this. The first scene is just about as gruesome as it could be. That's it. In the end, you get your revenge, by killing off the bad guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a mess. In fact, it is probably one of the worst films ever made. I cannot say that I had a good time watching this movie. I have seen some movies in the past. Some movies that are not this bad. I did like the "B" rating that the movie was at. Maybe I was expecting it to have one of these low movies that most movies have. If you are looking for an example of this bad movie. If the only reason you watched this movie was for entertainment and then this is why. The only reason I would ever recommend this movie to anyone, and recommend this, is if you enjoy some "B movies". And even then you'll be more than a little freaked out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original show was a "fairy tale". The series will be syndicated in syndication as well as be on the Sci-Fi Channel, with Sci-fi Channel's "Sci-Fi channel", so I guess it's only fair to say that this movie is for kids. This movie was very much a "kid" show, and had a very hard time getting me to actually care about the kids who were on this show, since they were constantly being hit by a bad guy, and they were forced to do a lot of bad, stupid things that were not funny, which was only partly to do with the characters themselves and partly due to the dumbness of the kid actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised that some of the younger friends who were friends with me ended up in this. Some of the older guys were kind of upset about the fact that I wasn't going to be a full-time firefighter, and then there's the fact I was on my way home to visit family in Florida. As it turns out, it was kind of a crazy idea to actually be a firefighter, which was kind-of the main reason I went to the fire academy, so if you're interested in that, and you can look at it from my perspective at that time, I really wanted to get it out of my system, I wanted to go see it through, and get it over with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It all started in the very first half hour of the movie, when they were doing interviews with the actors. I found myself looking at these actors as if they were some kind of expert who had all this deep knowledge of every single aspect of the story they were going to discuss.  I found the movie to be very shallow, very silly, very pretentious, and very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie with all of the usual group of kids in the past (which I will admit is a few of the biggest stars in the world - some of them are on their way here) and have to watch this one at the end of summer. Why? Why? If you are a parent - watch this movie - your kids might like it more - or they will be at least spared another bad movie that will be out of their minds by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you liked "Star Trek" movies, or have seen them in the past, you might be OK with "Trek" movies. There, they were in the space station, with the Enterprise. "Star Wars" is in a new galaxy, so the old-fashioned, hand-held devices are better suited to see a true "Star" adventure. I found the computer-generated figures to look very silly (I mean, so silly in fact that I couldn't even find a good angle on the figure, but it is true that there was a CGI model of a Rebel Trooper). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not like this movie for its lack of realism. In my opinion, it has to do with the fact that it's supposed to be a fantasy. I mean it's a comedy of course and a comedy based on a true story about a true hero.  My first thoughts when watching this were to find out how this was supposed to happen or if it was going to happen. That would be a really great movie. I would love to see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is full of a bunch of people. There's a reason why most major motion pictures are all very large. There are some really big scenes in "O-Zone" - one of the best ever. One of them actually takes place in a room that is so small that it almost looks like a small theatre. This is one of those moments of the O-Zone (a "zoo" or "animal park" - in the original O-zone) where you can't even get a big "toy" animal to fit in there - it has to fit through the gate that you put it in and squeeze it into place (literally).  It is just terrible. It was awful - completely horrible. I have no patience for it - it's not even worth viewing this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that hard to understand... it's hard to imagine an audience in such a dark time, dark story with dark characters in such circumstances, for what it is worth... the film has a few moments of some light, and there's a few lines of dialogue (e.g. the director's "I'll go get some beer") with some of the main characters (the main characters were in their natural environment for this kind of movie, they were in the desert of the Mojave desert, for instance) and a few people (mainly a few other actors). This is an entirely different kind of film. The desert is an almost exclusively white place, with absolutely no shade of any kind. The sun never rises, the sand is wet, and the film is made in the middle of a desert. The lighting is very bleak, and it's almost too dark to see anything, it looks like a kind of documentary, like a real feature film or TV series (it looks like it was made with only natural lighting, I believe). There are a few light-colored stars, mostly a couple of desert scenes (one of the girls in the "Tess of the Abyss" movie) and one or two desert scenes which are made out of artificial light, so the actors were in almost all cases wearing white and the girls were in light-colors, so, of course, we are going to see some of these desert scenes. In "TESS of the ABYM" they are very dark, so they are not wearing white. The characters are the main players in the film (the ones who inhabit the desert) who are basically wearing white, and are being played by pretty blond, white girls, and they were doing their best to make their skin look white. They were probably very excited to be "making out" with each other for their first time in this film, since this is a totally new setting, so maybe they really didn't know that they looked like that! Anyway, I can hardly see any sunlight or even any shadows in any of the desert scenes, and I think there are probably some desert scenes in the world which have that type of effects, since it's not hard to see how these places could have shadows, and, in the end, it's supposed to be a horror film, so I guess it would be the next best thing for these actors, and all of these actors had this film made in just the desert in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen this movie before and am now writing it here.  I like the original "Avengers" movies and want to see that movie again. I feel bad about this movie being the second movie in the trilogy (or whatever the sequel to "A.A.V.E.R" might be.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is "tolerated" by the "progressive" crowd. I'm glad to see that, I feel like a lot of the "radical" crowd still exist. If you have ever read an opinion piece, you know that their ideology is not to be respected or supported in this movie. If one of your friends had a girlfriend or a boyfriend, would you want him or her to go on a date with you or to see this movie?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really expecting to watch one of the newer films, one of these films. I really didn't have much information about it. I was hoping to read something about the film being about a former movie star or something. I have read through the book, the only part of the film that is about her, and it was pretty terrible. The book is a really good book, and I have just read it. It's about 100 pages. The movie wasn't even as good as the book.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is another one of those "what was once thought to be science fiction" movies. Some might say that it's more realistic, or that it has some kind of artistic merit. It is not really meant to be taken seriously. I would recommend you rent this movie to the guy in the next room or the guy that is interested in the science of it's own. This is not the movie you want to rent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was shot in New York. It was supposed to have some sort of effect on the real world, and, like all films made today, is filmed in low-budget and in a desperate attempt to salvage something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My girlfriend and I watched this movie with friends. We thought this movie was funny, something we could laugh at. I can't speak for how the movie ended up. My girlfriend (who's a huge Nancy Drew fan) thought she would laugh at how bad it ended up, she's only laughed because she didn't expect to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pleasantly surprised at how good the first 30 minutes of the movie were. It was about a black guy named James Cagney or even one of his co-stars who was an innocent teenager. This movie is about a middle aged black guy who is about the same age as a 70 year old white guy named Bill Paxton. And as I said earlier, this is a movie that was released in 1981 and is from a black perspective. It's time that I was given a chance to sit down and discuss this movie with a friend who is black. I feel that Bill Paxtons viewpoint has already been covered in many other films on this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be an original version of the movie, with Richard Chamberlain directing and me in the lead.  A few of my friends and I, including myself, have seen the original version. We liked it. Richard Chamberlain was the director and writer for the original movie. He did all the writing and directing there, and I feel he did just fine with the movie. There are still a few people who dislike the film for the same reasons and for some reason it was never released in the UK or the US. In the UK it's being released on DVD, and a few of us were also given a copy of the DVD in the US when it was on it's way out of the US for release, and we thought it was going to be released before the film was over.   The version of The Private Eye has been released in England, and it's released on Blu-Ray in the U.S.  I would imagine that the U-UK distributors are not the same, and therefore we will never know for sure. As a result of the film's being the way it was, I feel I must apologize to Mr. Chamberlain and myself. Richard is not one to let his films go untraced, and he's obviously very talented. I think he is best in his work, and his direction of the original is still great, and you just can't bring it over to a film like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie was directed by a group of about 20 friends, and I'm the only one who got paid to do it. I think it might have been very entertaining, like an independent film, because I'm pretty sure most of the "real" actors would have probably had some fun in this movie. In a group setting like this, one of the main reasons that I chose to watch this movie is because I wanted to see the "true" story, which would be a comedy. I don't think it would be an accurate portrayal of any of the characters in the movie. I thought that the movie was at least funny, and you can laugh at the idea of a group-movie, the kind of film that they made when I saw them do "My Life" and "My Time" in the 1990s. It's got a great cast in it, so I'm not the least bit embarrassed to admit to it. In fact, I recommend you watch it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I wanted to say to others "what are you doing to stop this movie" or to review it for the other reviewers.  I wanted the film to be a true masterpiece that I knew it could be. This is a movie you would be best off seeing at the festival circuit or with the cast of a feature film, not a festival or film. I'd like to make it clear to all of my fellow film makers, it's OK to be an independent filmmaker. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got a copy of the first one and was pretty close to what it was. The ending was not only bad but really, really bad. The reason I didn't see this when it was first released is because they didn't have to do a ton of reshoots or edit the film, so the director (who is, you know, still a director) can't really make an excuse for why he or she did it, and the ending is not only lame but downright terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The DVD was a movie with many great actors (Kelvin Harrison, James Cromwell, and Gary Merrill). The DVD is a movie that tries to be like a movie, a movie so bad that it's a joke. The DVD doesn't come with the usual great special effects, it's so bad, that I've never seen such a horrible movie.  If I had to watch this movie again, I'd never recommend it. It has nothing to do with the movie. If it has anything to do, it will make you laugh, or at least not get angry with it.

And I'm sure all parents have this fear of getting the kids hooked on some sort of video device. I can't even express how ridiculous this movie was.  It was utterly ridiculous, and the kids were not amused. My wife would like to give this movie a low rating for bad taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a film I wanted to watch for years, that will be aired on TNT or the SciFi Channel next fall. I just couldn't understand why they had bothered making this movie.  It is all about the Sci-Fi Channel in the original series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the film, I'm led to believe that I'm just the next to a million other Americans who were in the immediate past or were in it during World War I. I'm lead to believe I'm the only person who ever went to war, in an area not at war with my nation.    The film is called, 'The Lost Battalion' which I don't know if it was written or made up. The Lost Battalion was a unit that was involved in World War II, was given a new name by the American forces in Korea and was used for training and research purposes.  The new name is 'The "Red" Army' with the Red Cross emblem over it.  Also, they were taught how to shoot their guns, how to salute, and some of the basics of their lives.  It is the intent of the film to portray the experience of the soldier that went through the first wave of fighting, then the second wave of being surrounded by fire.

It is still the biggest and baddest thing I have ever seen. In fact, the only way I am able to watch this movie is with my eyes closed. It wasn't bad enough for the other bad guy that I think was the other one of the two bad guys in the movie.

I am not really in the mood to go down the pub with some guy who's really dressed in his underwear. It's not that the film is for me, but I'm sure you can imagine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when it first came out in 1992, with its silly-looking special effects. I was very skeptical of this movie and I thought, "I'll give it a try and I'll find out if I'm wrong". The first three or four films were made on an 8 mm camera, so I was familiar with the idea of special effects and how they're made, with such things as animatics, which are mostly very basic with clay or paper (in the case of "G" and "G-13") for this one.  The reason why I'm still waiting for a "G13" copy is because I'm so sick and tired of seeing clay figures, I really don't know why I would have to sit through this crap movie. And I can honestly say I was only mildly amused by the stupid little plot at the end. As I already wrote in the review for the first film, I was so annoyed by the "G"-13 release, I couldn't wait to get the movie back in the stores, when they were released in 1992. And, in addition, I thought I might be mad about it. It was so stupid. It's really a shame that I had to watch it over and over again, it really was boring and unbelievable. And if you're a fan of the original series, there's a reason why "G", the second time around, was so amazing. That's just one example, with the rest of the people, because the "original" series is just such an amazing piece of work. Why should it be the same for "G". What's really funny is that I did like the silly cartoon, where the guy gets his teeth pulled. I didn't really want to see another "G series", a "Garfield series", or any of those silly characters. The ending was just as unbelievable, and just so disappointing. Why did I see this movie, which was supposedly the last one, as such a "big surprise", it made me feel so cheated and cheated. The acting is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just a short film. It's about one hour long, if it even lasts that long. What makes me really sad about this movie is that it's about an adult's movie. It may not be a pedophile film. Even so, I would rather watch something like this than something like "The Lost Boys" or "Teen Beach Squad". This movie was made by a group of "specialists", "professionals". This means that the production team went out to look for actors that fit the role. These professionals will be the ones to decide whether a child actor fits into this movie, not a bunch of kids that you can buy at the mall. They are the professionals who will see the movie and judge it based on their professional standards. That's why "The Boys" is better than "Boyz."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not really a great idea. The story is about an average guy, and the guy's wife. The movie was really about the guy and his friends at the beach, and about his friend's sister and her husband, and that's about all I really can say, at least for now. I recommend you see this movie with your buddies and your friends or family who know you best. This movie had a great cast and but I did not really want to take any time away from the guy who was going to star in it, so I would recommend you go see it with him. If you watch the movie without him you may not understand what happened. I'm sure you'll all want to know what happens, you're just not really there at that moment, which is why I'd really like to say something more about this movie now. My only other advice is to go see this one with somebody who knows you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen the movie in a hotel in New York and it was very well directed. A few weeks later, I saw this film and was very confused. Why did I start watching it was supposed to be a comedy? Why did it have such a bad influence on this movie. It was very strange and it had no real story, nothing at all. It's one of the worst movies ever made and I'm not sure if it's because they can't get a license or if it was made by the director or the actor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the actors in the film, Richard Attenborough, would like us to believe that he was actually in London during the time. Attenbury and I would agree he was in the UK at that time (the early 1930s).  I think the film was originally intended to be a period piece (it was made in 1936).  This is my first attempt at a review of the film...it is only about 10 years old and was released in 1997! It's been rereleased twice, in 2000 and 2002!   It's not even really a horror film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had been a pretty good one, with an all American cast and director, so there was that to go by. That was the only reason that I'd like to go on.

In short, I found this movie much like it had been before, the same basic plot but much more boring than any attempt to make fun of. If you are looking to watch a movie that is about what it is supposed to be and is going to be really good, watch the movie that you just saw.

The movie is a piece of work. It's hard to find any laughs, and I have seen it. In fact, I don-t care about seeing it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the screening of "I" at the Los Angeles International Film Festival, this movie seems to be the first attempt to create a movie that would be released as a feature film. The end result is a pretty poor movie about a pretty good idea. It's hard to take a movie like this seriously. The only good thing about this movie is the fact that it might get shown in a video game, or in a documentary like "I'm Johnny Mathis," and I'll give that film a little credit. It was a movie about math and logic and a movie where the character "Mathis" would be playing. The math and the logic should have been on the screen in some form, and there is nothing to recommend this movie. I really hope that the end result of this movie will be the release of a film on DVD by somebody that is just as bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't read any of the books, so I can't really compare the two. If you want to compare, I can tell you that the movie is a lot like the book, and in many ways, though more subtle, the movie seems like it could have been filmed like the books. The book, for example, is much more cinematic. It's a wonderful book, with some of the best writing in the world.    If you're really reading to read, like reading a novel, the book can be read and enjoyed for years.  This film, I couldn't really do the same for the majority of reasons. Maybe the director felt the need to portray this movie as a movie of all time. As to why, I don't think the movie can hold any responsibility for my bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that by now, we were at least accustomed to seeing it on HBO.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have already discussed this movie with the movie reviewers.  I am pretty certain that this movie was directed with the same intention as the first one, which was to show that an actor who was "over-the-top" was going to be a great actor.  Because of the circumstances I would be more honest and say, "If I had the chance to make it through, this is the movie I would have liked to see."  The movie was the beginning of the year, and the story is a little ridiculous, and even the title of the movie refers to a very serious movie with "The Life" in the title, not a romantic, sentimental piece. The movie also had the movie-within-the movie which was a movie about another real-life "sister-in-law," and that sister-in law was a really good actress. The film starts out at the house with the young girl. If you have not read the book or seen the movie, you don't get the full story.  (At least I had no clue as I started watching this.) I would recommend that this film is the only one that you watch the movie within a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason for this movie is to promote a musical version of a musical which has been in the theaters for a year and a half. As a fan of the musical and as a writer, I hope to be able to make a musical, even one that would have been about some sort of character or character development. After I saw the first cut of the film, I was very disappointed. To be honest, I do believe the song for this is much better than the first one, especially when it was on Broadway. I saw an ad about it on TV that said that it was a parody, and I believe that it is a better song. So, I'll give it another chance. I believe I will enjoy the song.butbutbutBUTbutbut but the version that is on the DVD, I can't imagine the director really getting into it. There are a lot of actors involved in the movie. The movie opens with a scene of a big house in the mountains. You see a mountain that is like the size of Texas.  And you go to this house that has the town sign for the town of Pheonix, with three actors there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you know anything about me, you know that I'm a film buff and that I can find something to watch with anything. I don't think they just found something to find the film. The film itself, in it's worst aspect, is a very, very poor "prestige movie" made by the big Hollywood stars. There's nothing like the film industry as a whole, with no "A" movie made in 2001 and a "B" film made in "A." The film's actors are good. It seems the people who made this film were fans of the film, or at least people who had the good fortune of seeing the film in theaters, and were able to recognize the real stars, and that's the best they could do.  It's obvious to me that it's not made by a group of people who were trying to make money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As bad as this movie seems to be, it actually seems to have been filmed. It is actually a film.butbutbutBUTbutbutbecause it is a low budget production, you don't get very nice looking or attractive people in your films. They are pretty much all pretty and pretty decent looking people (they are in the film anyway, with a few exceptions).  The lead in this film, is played by the guy who plays the lead in the original. (G). This leads me to conclude that it is meant to be a film for teenagers and teenagers who are only interested in being very good looking. The idea of this film was to give the general public the impression of the film. As a result of that, there are a couple of girls in the movie who are not so innocent as they were in the 'original' movie.   What the heck are we going to do? The guys in the audience have never seen a film about this topic, so I don't know if they are going to have an emotional response about this.  I would recommend you spend a couple hours and watch the original 'Tower of Terror'.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is awful.  I didn't like the idea of a guy getting his foot crushed by a car or his head crushed by an SUV. I didn to, and I don't know how the movie gets out of this movie. Maybe it was just poorly directed and I just don't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this film was made in a day. This was just about a month of filming, and there were only two leads, one who was a nice, charming, funny man, and the other who looked just as goofy and foolish as he does here. I found myself laughing, in the same place, at some of the antics they did, like when they were pretending to be drunk (you know, the ones where they were dancing and falling down). And you know, you don't have to sit still for a minute. So I didn't like the comedy factor of this movie. I think it's best when it was very light and simple, as in a comedy show. In my opinion, it was a very, very silly film, and I think I might have been a "good kid" by pretending to watch it. I've been a big fan of the silly-comedy films that were made when I was younger, and thought I might get to see some of those today. This one seemed very, VERY serious, and it just doesn't make sense to me as a comedy movie, and that's one of the reasons that the film was so badly written from the beginning, as to how it was supposed to be done. To make it even more sad, I found out that, when they had a baby (who was about a year-and-a-half old), they found out about the terrible thing they did on this film and decided not to release it, because it was too much of a mess...  I'm just not a kid that is going to let myself be subjected to this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few hours after seeing it, I found myself in the same state as when the movie started (which was in a theater in Hollywood) and had the same feelings, the same kind of disappointment I had when watching the movie "A Woman in Love" about a few weeks later. It's sad that this movie will get more exposure at this time, because it's a movie with the purpose of raising awareness about domestic violence. I feel like the director wanted to make a movie that would give people insight and change behavior. I really felt it was the wrong movie for domestic violence survivors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like movies with real, simple endings. I like films where you feel involved. And when I think of movies that have real endings, I think they're sad. I can't even watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had ever met anyone who was involved in this production, I would have been the first to know about this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens with a brief mention of the existence of some film buffs, who had seen this particular version of the film (it was the only version on video, and I had seen it in 1980). So, I'd guess that the film buffs had already seen this one at the time, perhaps because it was the one that was being released as part of "A Movie of the Week".  This was probably just one of the last copies, and was made for the TV set.  It was originally released on video in the UK (I think) in 1981.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an adaptation of a very interesting book, and the actors (all except one) seem to be trying to take a page out of the book in their attempts to re-work the story. They keep coming back to "The girl that was on the train", "the girl with the scar", and this is what they keep saying. I don't think they can come up with an idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to this film because the movie was so great and the acting was great. There were three actors from the movie that are credited in it. I really wanted to see the movie because when I saw this film it was one of the first movies I ever saw (from the 70s) and I think I remember it. The actors that were credited in the movie were just from the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After my wife and I drove from Denver to Chicago, I sat in Chicago, which is an hour and a half from downtown Chicago. It is just so awful. What an insult. The best part of it's the idea of an "American accent", because this movie is so obviously an attempt at making a joke out of it.  The only reason I watched this movie was to get my mind off the movie.  I could have stayed and watched it, which isn't a good idea, at least, of course, at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good reviews that people have of "Discovery" came from the good reviews of Richard Alpert's work as the original "DARWIN", so I thought it might be a good movie. This movie has a very confusing story, which can be summed up in two words: The movie is all about the "Danger of being wrong." This movie could not be more stupid and is in no way related to the character's death or his mother's journey. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about the murder of a white male on campus (with a few white females thrown in there).  It's pretty scary, I mean the killer is about to bite the skin off of someone and then take off some people. It's not one of the most suspenseful movies, since there's more than just a white killer stalking around campus (as well as more white females, and the killer doesn't bite the people as he tries to bite other people's throats, in the end of the movie, with a killer who is about 30 or 40 years old, he's not much different from what you'd see in the first film (which was based on a true story).  The movie goes beyond just the murder. It was the subject of a campus review, with the topic of sexual harassment, and it's about a killer getting into a frat house, or a fraternity house and trying to sexually assault a female student. If you think about it, you don't really find out the "story" until after the frat party ends and when the woman says, "You killed my friend and raped my roommate" or "You tried to rape this woman". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening sequence features a scene of a guy getting his head stuck in a plastic barrel. The opening scene is so unbelievably bad... and I swear I saw this at some point in the past, it is beyond stupid... and at the end, the opening scene ends with the character getting her head stuck up into a telephone pole, too... I would never recommend this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be a film that would show the horror of Vietnam vets coming back and finding their lost comrades. The Vietnam vets have no clue as to what they are supposed to do or what's going on. They have no idea how to be an actor and they are not good actors. I saw a good Vietnam vet who had a good eye for the situation and who had an interesting way of acting and I would say they made Vietnam's John Wayne look like a god. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that kept me from seeing this movie was that I was really not looking for an action movie. There were some really nice actors, and I was looking for the same type of thing in this movie. I didn't get to watch them. The best acting was done by Richard Belzer, and he is a big fan of this film. He is the main character in the film.  So, the movie is very bad and it doesn't make sense. I was in the same boat with Richard Belzner, who was trying to do his own movie and just found out about this one, too. Richard Belzman was so annoying and annoying, in a movie I like to watch. He even got mad and said that he has changed his acting style! That is the only reason I'm giving this movie a 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why I've watched this film is because my friends and I have talked about the future of the "Star Wars" franchise, and we want to know what kind of future we have. The future of this film may end up as an important lesson for "Star Trek," in terms of the idea that there is no future in "Star Treks," and what they should really do. If the future direction of the new "Star Tours" is "StarTrek," with the same kind of commitment to "StarWars" movies as we've seen in "A New Hope," then this would be a perfect opportunity to end this trilogy on a high note, but instead, we've got to watch this movie again after 10 years in theaters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see this movie at the New York Film Festival, so, I got a bit of a taste for the festival. The New York fest was in Manhattan and had a much more diverse crowd of the movie goers. In Manhattan, the film was screened at a cinema that was all white, all males, and was the only movie shown in black and white.   It was the "Wendy" movie, with the "Aunt Wenda" (that's me). I'm not surprised that this movie is "wonderfully" acted, I just don't understand why we wasted our time, money, and energy trying to see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One thing that may or may not surprise you is that I really should have been making movies when I was in middle school. I had the pleasure of seeing the original "Rocky" movie for 10 minutes.  It is possible that this movie is for children and children's film groups, so, in that case, don't go see it with your kids unless you have a really good reason to do so, because I found it to be very dull.  I am a big fan of John Lithgow and had really high hopes that this was going to make a point about the "Babe" part of my film and a point of this film. It is not going to be entertaining and I can't recommend this movie for anyone. It may be entertaining to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is horrendous. The character is so ridiculous. He is just one step away from being a buff. His clothes, his height, his weight, his face, he's just so pathetic. His face was about to drop off. His wife and his friend think that he's such a big man. He was in such a hurry, his head has nothing to show. And just for a few seconds, he actually looked up at me while he said something to the effect of "Hey, my wife is looking at me like a man!"  I didn't get any "Honey" or "Baby" or anything. And no matter how much of a freak show or anything else you want to believe about it. He's an idiot, pathetic, and a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To me, this movie was as a whole about the movie "The One With the One Tree".  I am not sure how much influence the movie has in the world of real estate. It really doesn't have anything to do with real estate, real estate agents, realtor, realtors. I think they have all already been told. "The Movie with the One Trees" was a very important, very influential movie with a lot of influence and meaning. The plot and message was in direct conflict with this movie, and in fact, this would make the perfect ending to the movie. I am still waiting for it to come out on DVD, and I hope this movie never makes it to DVD. The movie is very dull, the characters are completely flat, and the story is just awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of Frank Capra, and have seen and liked most of his work. I believe that this film would appeal to a young audience, or a "Hollywood" crowd. The Capra film would have been a family film, and this would be more about a "teen film" in my opinion, which would be the reason why I saw this film. There were no really strong leads in this film, which may have been the result of some "talent" being lost. I was not exactly looking for a "serious" film. This film was very similar to other films I have seen. It is about a guy who is in love, which is exactly what it was about in Capra's film, in terms of the love for his mother and the mother-daughter bond. So I thought there could have been some variation in this, to make it more realistic and not just like a love story that was in this one too. It was really disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of a lot of "Gods" movies, and this is one of those movies, with an English cast who is trying to do "English God" roles, the film is about to enter into the "Hollywood" realm, and the film will be forever "Hurt" and "Hated" by me, so I'd suggest it be avoided by movie-goers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is set in the city of San Francisco, on the western outskirts of the city (the "Outer Mission" section of the Mission San Francisco). This is a neighborhood within the city that, due to its urban setting, has a large immigrant population. I assume this is the neighborhood where the movie was filmed. I find it unfortunate that this film (and the series, for that matter) was set in one of the areas where the people were more integrated and closer to the Mission residents. The Mission Bar was a neighborhood where many Mission residents live. We have a couple of other Mission bars in the Outer Mission and some very well known Mission people who are in bar scene scenes here and there (Cristina Calderon, James Belushi, Joe Cocker, etc.), and who would have been good candidates for this film, had they been chosen. The bar scene in "The Big Bang Theory" is a very small one, as I recall, and the same goes for the bar scene at the start of the film. This film is a "lost" part of the SF Mission Mission Street scene. I did watch it at a screening, so I am biased. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so far from being a movie that you feel so bad, that's how I'm feeling about it, it's all about a real movie, it doesn't feel like a real film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how they do this or even why this movie exists. I was very surprised at the review here, this film is probably the worst film of all the films from the point of the release of this one. This movie has the worst special effects I've seen, and the actors are just terrible. The whole film is just a piece of crap.  The only redeeming quality in this film was that there's a scene of some people in the movie. This really was the only part that really made me watch this entire film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is boring, and the girl looks at a boy.  This movie is so bad and so bad that I didn't want to watch it for two weeks. I can't even be sure whether this is made for girls, boys or men, since I was very suspicious about the whole thing and had to watch this movie again after reading the book.  It could have been a horror movie, or even a stupid one. The only thing that might be remotely funny is this guy's movie, because he's just a kid! If you enjoy horror or comedy, you might laugh with this movie, and I'm not saying it's the last horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a sucker for all things Sci-Fi. The first Sci-fi movie was the first film I ever saw on TV when it came out in the 70's and it was my favorite Sci-Film of all time. The second Sci-F movie is a piece of garbage. It doesn't deserve it's honor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After I saw the movie in the theater, I watched it on cable TV in January, and even though the movie had just ended, I still thought that maybe someone would have given me a copy, because I'm not really into movies that are too expensive, I don't really like watching movies that come in a vacuum, and have an entire movie on DVD to just have this. I'd like to give the filmmakers credit for putting up a decent movie, which they have done in the past. I think that they made the "Scoop" with the "Tropic Storm" series, which was a great movie.  The characters were all well-played, but I felt that this movie had nothing to do with the characters themselves. I am not trying to be rude to the characters; I was really just saying that the plot wasn't really that good either. It didn't help that the actors were good.   The movie could have been a really good film for the "Hole In The Wall" or "Randy's Rodeo" series. There's another movie, "The Man From New York" that I thought was really good, and one that the "Crimson Ace" series is a great sequel to. So I thought that the story would have been something that is just really, really good and make the movie into a great one. The story about the young woman wanting to have an affair is really very interesting, because it's the most typical thing that any woman goes through in life, with her mother, her father, her best friends, etc.  A good movie is really a movie that touches your emotions and gets you to really, truly, really, totally freak out. We're all, even though we're not normally in the "romantic" department, just kind of numb or are in shock to what's going on, with someone acting really, and getting us so completely turned off that you would say you'd never want to spend any more money. You get sucked in and lose interest in what you're watching.  I'm sorry, just really really, because you will lose the plot to get your eyes to work at the end.  If you were to be looking for a horror movie, or something like that, you would watch this movie, and think about it more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, the film starts out good because it is a documentary about the life of this legendary writer of the novel, in this film, I find that the director of the film, as well as the cast, is trying to make a film about something that they have not really been trained to do. The acting is not great. There are some scenes that are very dark and sad and I thought, because of how dark the film is, the cast could go completely crazy and jump on some drugs and play the part like an actor playing the part of someone who has just lost their baby. Some people might find some solace in this part of the story and that some of the characters might be given some sort of psychological breakdown (if you watch a lot of the TV series). And this is why people like to see the film. I don't think they wanted to make another 'Godsend', they wanted something serious and tragic. If the director is to blame for this, they are trying to follow the path the film was trying to go with, rather than following a typical horror film and drama-driven film like the one that the film really is (although I suppose the director and the producer are doing the best they can in this genre).  I am not sure if I would say that this film is a masterpiece in this regard, which is probably just my personal opinion, because a film by director John Hillcoat, 'Gates of Heaven', is a true masterpiece in that regard, in that he directed a film that was extremely serious and dramatic with a story that was very good and well-crafted. There is a reason why he was so well-known for doing so.   My hope is that this is just the film that John Hill coat and the cast were working off of.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of John Carpenter and he's already got the remake and the first movie coming out and all of his other movies.  John Carpenter is one of the most brilliant directors out there (he directed all of those classic horror flicks). So it's very shocking to me that they just made this movie. What I was able to say is that the "prequel" was a much bigger budget horror movie which was actually quite good (I did like the fact that the original movie had "precursor" to this one).  The film was very slow and didn't give you a satisfying look. It was very much a "pre-movie" and made me think that it was going to end up as another horror movie like the other one (not really sure about the other two films).

If you have read the book, then you would know exactly what you would expect. Not for the book. If there was any justice in this movie, I would have a total of 50+ views in this review, because I don't think it's going to go well with the cast.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must say I don't think this movie is a masterpiece. It is just like the next movie: a total ripoff of what the original was and what it tried to be. I was a huge fan of the show and enjoyed seeing the first two seasons and was really disappointed about watching the second episode in the car as I tried to watch it on the show. There was a lot of money spent in creating that show and it deserved a 10/10 (like it did for a lot on the DVD cover). I can understand a lack of appreciation for the show or for being so cheap (how many people know about the first episode!) and I can imagine that the episode was a one-shot or one-night show. My friends and I would have just wasted our money watching that episode. I found the first couple of episodes and the episode with Michael in the diner to really interesting and interesting, and we got to see all the old-timers in a small way and learn about how the show had been done.  So it's a good thing I like the first few episodes of this show, and the one I remember from watching the show before I watch this one. I don`t find the pilot episode to be very fascinating or entertaining in any way, and don`ts really seem to be made for TV. That`s really just an excuse. As for the rest, it`s not a series. The first season was about a group of misfits and the second season was more like a series of misadventures. The second episode of the pilot (for some reason) has a "Carry On!" episode for a couple of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see it on DVD, so that's why you know how this movie turned out on DVD.    It's because it was a huge hit on TV.  And they kept showing it on TV, and then it was released on DVD and they put a new cover on it with some new features in it. That was one of the reasons the cover had the features in the box.  That was because they were trying to recapture the TV show, and they made it look more real and have the actors in it, and try to bring the feel of the TV series back. But it's terrible. I don't understand why it even had the cover it did, or even why they put the film out on T. It's just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to make this movie into a film for everyone. It's a movie for a small number of friends, and people who know what they're talking about (and they'll be in for a surprise!). There's a good bit of humor in this film, but it's not so big a thing as you might have hoped. I mean, I just made this movie about 4 months ago, and the movie really is about the two leads, who are only 10 years old.  It's also a short movie. I have to say, there's very little time. And I can understand why you might want to go find out what really happens. There might be a plot and all that jazz, you might get to see some of the best of the actors and their brilliant acting. It would certainly be a great movie to make with a lot more time. I think a director should be allowed to make their movie, so they can try to show a real life scenario about a real person, rather than a fake movie. For example, if the movie had been a comedy, this would be very much different. It was a true story about a group of friends who lost a friend of theirs, with one of the biggest names in town (like Gary Merrill). You can definitely make a movie with just the two main leads, and they are really good.   And so, this is about two young people with some small roles and a real plot, but nothing too exciting (at least for me) or really anything that would really stand out, since you just don't really get to know the characters that much, because the movie is really short and it's basically all about them.  I guess it just didn't happen to be an ideal opportunity to go to the beach, you know?  And also, the movie does come off like a little silly because there's a bunch of kids in a beach (even though it's really about two kids) in a really silly, "The Beach" type scenario. There's some very cute (I'm sure I'm right) children's toys, as well as some funny, "adult" things, like a silly parody of a horror movie. There are some great actors, and I just wanted to give them the chance to shine in this movie, and in a way they're a bit lacking (maybe it's because I didn't have the chance), since there are a couple of very cute kids and there are
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not the greatest comedy ever done in Hollywood. It could be a really funny and light film for this movie. I could see the movie at a small, late night "adult movie" theater showing a great "Comedy" joke or a joke at some comedy club. There is no point in trying to do this, it is the worst movie ever. Don't bother buying it and don't buy it at any price. I recommend you watch this on tape or read the book version of the book, which is really funny, but it is so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really poorly made.  It's a really awful, horrible movie that leaves an awful taste in your mouth and can't even make you finish it. It's just awful. The movie has the ability to have its own plot, I think there is a really sick joke somewhere with how I can even finish this movie. I'm still finding the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie is the only movie it will be pretty terrible.  If you go see the movie on the big screen, you will be able to really appreciate how stunningly beautiful that the girl looks but you will want to sit down and have a drink of something to calm your nerves after you see her on the small screen... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea how this movie was made or what exactly it is about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is not interesting. The guy doesn't even wear a suit and he is in a tuxedo and he has a mustache. If you were to really look at him, you'd see a total of six or seven inches on his frame. It is unbelievable that a movie would be about "The King of Kings". To be honest, this movie was more like a love letter to a movie director and writer who was not really involved in the movie, and it is disappointing. I have no idea how it is possible that this movie is considered a "film" and it will certainly make the movie "better". This film is, as I read, really awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this in the US on cable about 3 years ago.  The movie was rated PG-13, and there was a good amount of explicit language in this film, as well as nudity, and it wasn't really all that extreme. (I think it's about 5 minutes for each of the main characters. The actors are pretty good, though.)   The scene with the guys in the library and the girls in the town square is very, very, really, very sexy, and I think I've seen that scene a couple of times. I found it so,but only on the beach. On the beach, the guys were naked (I found that at the end of the scene in the bar). This scene happens in a town.  I found that it was so inappropriate.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know the director was in the film business before, and that may have influenced his thinking. I have no idea what his reasoning is. Maybe I'm too old to make this film about this stuff... Or maybe he thinks it'll be funny to make a comedy about his friend's kid getting killed by a freakish little man in an alleyway... He seems to think his friend will like it, which is the best guess from his performance in the rest of his life. Perhaps he's trying to make an honest, funny, realistic, and realistic comedy about the death of a real person, which seems to have been completely disregarded. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Citizen Kane" is considered the best film ever, a great documentary with an excellent cast. The problem I found was how long the film was, about 30 to 35 minutes. I wasn't going to watch it over and over again, so there was an extra hour. It's a small film in comparison to the one made by Citizen Kane, and I guess it's a little bit less interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One scene is worth watching, in which I try to see how I'm going to handle a female director; I do have an interest in film and the ability to direct, since I grew up on films in the '50s, and had to watch and work on my brother's movies. I really don't want to think about that. In another scene there's a woman who wants to do something that I think of being the best actress in the world.   What was the purpose of even taking it on the road, since we had it in the hotel?  I don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this movie before and had the opportunity to see the first one again.  I thought it was quite funny at the beginning with Billy Connolly (a small and short guy) and I figured, perhaps, that I could just get into the movie and see how Connolly came to be such a famous actor. Well, I had watched this for what it was to get a laugh. It had nothing to do with the movie as an honest attempt to depict Connolly as an actor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a fan of the old "Vampires" type of movies, and I never was one of the movie makers for such movies.  The actors in this version are from another planet. The Earth has already given birth to the other two planets. What kind of planet has been given birth? Is it a planet that is capable of reproduction in the usual manner? There are no good guys or bad guys, good guys, bad guys or heroes... It's just really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is not really any "twist" here. It seems they did this film just for laughs and wanted to be a big hit with their friends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening credits are pretty good. It was "Patton on his way to the theater" who made his way there, it was about a "newbie" in theater who was still in the Army and had never acted in a movie before. They had to learn the ropes, since he was no real veteran, just another theater goer.  You can watch the movie on HBO, you can't watch it on HBO. It's been shown on HBO in some movies. I don't know why you'd rent it. And they made it worse.

I am really in need of answers. I found the movie was boring. And after an hour of my life I was so angry with the end result that I went to see this. I will admit the movie had an element of tragedy/suicide. I think it was pretty cool and there are scenes of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did not expect much. I was watching this for the money, to be honest. The movie is made for people to enjoy,but not the best it can be. The guy playing his guitar seems to be really good and has some great ideas for the movie, so I am hoping that he can make it in time for the DVD release. This is a story about people who are trying to be the best, so it's important that it's good, and if it's the only movie you ever hear of the guy playing guitar for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched "Seven" and enjoyed that movie. I was looking forward to a movie in which I could come back to see a familiar face.

I give it the lowest rating I can give this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is pretty good: the movie is a black man's story. It's about a black guy who was born into slavery and who was saved by the story of another black man.  In the movie, this man's life isn't given enough.  The movie tries to tell us the story, and its hard to believe it's from the movie version. What about the film version is worth viewing?  The film was based on the book and has a story that revolves around the history of the slave trade in the US and has lots of detail and depth to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched this movie, I was totally unaware of the premise behind it. A friend of mine who lives in the San Francisco Bay area told me about the movie "A Day in the Life", and I was a student at San Francisco State. That's where he is, and he explained it to me, and I just didn't get it. So, I don't blame the director for trying to figure out the right way to do this movie. I've never seen this movie before, so it was like the opening of a horror flick, I knew it was going to be like a horror movie, and then my friends and I are all sort of biased towards it.   I can't say I got the enjoyment of watching this movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really painful. If you've ever watched a horror movie, this is the type of movie that is meant to inspire you. It is hard to believe that a director could do this movie in the same movie that he released his last movie, "The Devil Inside." It was funny because there was a lot of gore and gory movies (which I saw the first of which was titled, "Halloween Haunt"). It just wasn't funny or good. There was really no real purpose for the whole movie, from start to finish. If anyone saw the movie with the original trailer that I had on the shelf, you'd find that there was no gore, no real gore, and the whole thing seemed like a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first movie that had just been released. I'd just seen a copy of "The Sound of Music", as we were in New York to see the film, and found it to be an Oscar nominee or something, as I'd been told. And, since this movie was released in late September in the UK and was in the "New York" section in stores, I felt I was just getting into it (I just didn't think it'd have been a good movie, in the way it came out). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how they came up with the "perfect" person, or how this guy is supposed to be in the perfect marriage. I have been to the wedding of all my friends and have seen it, the bride and groom are in love with each other but there's nothing to say that he feels the same way. The whole movie is not that great and the music is a bit loud. But this is all about the two of them getting married, not about the movie itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is very slow, as if it were made for a very slow film festival, as the actors, both in character and in acting, they do not really seem to be a team; they don't really get to know each other, and the movie tries to convince us that a small army was going to come in and rescue us from the end. This is just pure ignorance of the basic fact that it's supposed to be "The Last Stand." I've seen this movie at a few other festivals, so I've already got an idea of how to defend myself, and I thought I was prepared for it. This movie is about the Last Man, the last one alive.  I'm just glad I didn't go home and watch this movie with my father or my mother.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the most famous writers in the world, William Goldman (author of Treasure Island and other Treasure Island novels) is supposed to be directing this movie. He is actually directing the movie on the set of the original Treasure Island.  I have been through the entire Treasure Island books myself. The only differences between the two novels are the fact that William Goldman is now making his debut as a screenwriter in a movie, and that he is writing for an independent production company, which is one of the reasons that this movie will be released in the U.S. on video (in this country at least) rather than print (it was a hard sell back in 1974).

So you want to see it, there's a reason to see the rest of the movie, just go see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been made for a big screen in the UK and it was to be released as a big blockbuster. It seems they didn't understand the first "noise" in the film when the crew left the station.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has a pretty good story behind it with some of the best actors of the 80s.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all let me just say, that there are some people out there that may like this movie. They've all probably already seen it, and as the reviewer, this is for people who didn't see it. The premise of this movie is an extremely stupid one. The movie makes absolutely no sense. And I'm not even going to touch on the whole incest scene, or incestuous scene. It's a completely absurd premise for a movie that anyone who's not already depressed, sick, or crazy, to get into. This film doesn't deserve your time. And if you're lucky you can get your money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about two friends, a woman, and a man, and, really, you should know the story by now and if you do not, then you're just making up your mind about who you're going to see. I was surprised by how many people I met on this trip, some who seemed genuinely interested in the movie and really, sincerely wanted to see this movie, like I was talking to one woman in New York City. I did not like the fact that I had to meet my own husband in the film and, by some strange accident of fate, I knew that this film would be about me. I had seen the trailer for this movie on the web, and I was already certain that I would want to see a short, one-scene movie about my own wedding. I didn't want to think that it would be this overrated, like this movie is. I gave my film a rating of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only hope that this was the only movie that ever was to find out just how bad it was. The director's characterizations of himself and his girlfriend were not even close to real. He made no effort at trying to make himself look good. When I say "real", I mean "real". The only good thing that could come out of this movie is a short film that was made by the same person, the director of this one was made about eight years earlier, so he knows the actor in question, who I know, has been in similar roles in a couple of movies. He should have done his part as a professional actor and, by his very own admission, he should have been the one making this movie. He was too young to be an actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen some of the worst movies out there, and I don't know if it was the director, or if it is just me, but I don the title from the video, and it doesn't make it appear to be the "bad movie". Maybe the movie just isn't for some people, but it's not a movie to watch and just plain sucks. It has some very good moments that I thought made it better. I saw it the first time on TV in France, and then on TCM France and VTCM France, the movie was the "Rabbit's Day" or "Hog's Day".  I was curious about what would happen. I guess I was also curious what the title of the movie would be. And there is a scene in the movie about a couple of cowboys, who are at a farm and having a love affair. The couple get in the vehicle and the scene is very sweet, and "Ricochet" (the director calls it) is all about making the cowboys very close to each other.  I hope the cows are well cared for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't give this movie the highest rating because it wasn't meant to be a serious study, or something like that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the movie was going to be a "big" film (I'm a writer and know the industry). Maybe one or two people would have wanted to see this movie and some of these writers from the late '70's had written this story. This movie was not written by the late "Hollywood" era writers. This film was a "HBO" or "Cinemax" movie (whoever, really), a "C-movie". What does that mean? And the movie didn't change after two hours. Why? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to find a good quote from the man who wrote the book, or to find any decent review on his book, and to be honest, if you were an expert in writing, you would probably be able to put this movie into some form of "story" which would not have to be called "fiction", because it's only "factual" or "historical" or something like that.  I didn't think it would be that hard to do and the last movie made it into "literary fiction" or some similar form, and I'm afraid it was a success as that film was "literature". The movie is very difficult to watch because it tries to be like "The Ten Commandments" or similar kind of movie, and most movies have something to do with the characters.  It is also pretty bad at everything else, and is definitely a waste of 90 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited to have just seen the film and be able to enjoy a film with other people that I might just get a chance to see a film by people at my college. I think that in retrospect it's time to move on with the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has been said that this film is based on "The Naked Gun" and the only nudity involved in that one scene. I think the film is "The Dog" if you like that sort of thing. It's funny that the director was so open about this idea of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought this movie would be about "The great silent film era", about a group of young men, and I thought that it would be a pretty funny, offbeat, fun movie with a lot of "mystery", that would be all I would say. The whole idea behind this movie is not just to re-visit silent films, it's a series of short, mostly unrelated stories that don't all fit together in a neat little package. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this film in a rather relaxed frame of mind (i think it was "Waking Up in New York" or something) and, with no real knowledge of the events of the past that were so important to me, was hoping that it would at least be a film with an "intimate" feel (since i've only seen "The Queen" and the "The Lady" so far and the latter is one of the more popular films of the time), to find out what i would be sitting in front of was completely disappointing.  The acting was so bad that I was at a loss to watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was made in 1983, which is about 30 years ago, and it was released in 1991, so they went ahead and released it.  "Soylent Green" is a completely different film with a completely new cast, and this is just the start of the problems.  The film is called "Soya", which means that it's a vegetarian film, and since it was made by people who are not vegetarian, they apparently weren't familiar with all the chemicals that are used in making the movie, or just the food that isn't vegetarian, and the film was released by a major movie distributor, the Criterion Collection, which releases some truly amazing documentaries about meat (see "Meat City", "Meat Market", etc). They aren't used to the "S" that we have here, and they didn't seem to understand the message behind it. It's not about getting people to stop eating meat, it's about educating people about all the things that go into making a perfectly good vegetarian meal, and I don't believe they thought that the film would be a "film" about the film they had to make, and as such, the film doesn't have any credibility. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're like me, a fan of "The X Files", you'll probably find the series quite attractive, in that it's "A long way from home" which makes it appealing as a TV series and the cast, including John Cusack, is decent, including a few of the regular supporting characters. It appears that a few other supporting actors got lost, such as the supporting character played by Richard Belzer in a scene in which he takes a dump in the middle of the street. Perhaps one of the other characters was also in the wrong part of town.  I think it was the other supporting actor that was supposed to be in the local neighborhood and didn't know he'd be in town, or perhaps one of them didn't like to be reminded of the fact that they were actors. In any case, the supporting cast is good, though if you were expecting more than just a brief "spoof on the old series" (as would be the case in most of the films of the show), you'd be disappointed because they're doing exactly that here. I'm sure you'd really like the "spoils" (see a little more below) which are quite famous, and I think I'd see more of them!  A good idea is to see if you can spot them, as they're in "The House That Dripped Blood", and then you can really find them.  This film, while set in the real town of Redding, doesn't really have the "filler" you would see in a sitcom, in which case you would have had to pay money to see it. The "house" itself is a small, so maybe the supporting characters would have liked to have been in some form of "house," because they would have been better off, of course.  It's more or less a comedy, a far cry from an hour-long drama, and it was to be expected of that, though it didn't make sense that it should have been more serious than it was. Also, it doesn't seem like the other "researchers" who made films of this subject would have the luxury of doing research on the subject matter for this, just as the other character in the film is a complete amateur. It is a waste of time, not to mention an embarrassment to the very name of "Redding High School".  (The school district is about a 90-minute drive from the nearest town,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found that the movie was mostly about "how this movie affects people in the future." This movie had little to no real focus, and was about so many things. I can't tell you how much it cost to get this movie in. And don't get me started about the fact that the director wanted to film it in Los Angeles, where I live in Florida. I would recommend renting it in New York City, or even Chicago (the same movie). In any event, this movie was a bad, crappy piece of work, which will leave you cold and tired after viewing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Mysteries" is a fairly good movie. It has some very good actors in it, including a couple of well known actors in Hollywood, and I was looking forward to seeing this one because I'm a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's (the "Eternal Runner") film "A Starship For Everyone" (the first of his two films to come out in 1998). There are good reviews on IMDb (i.e. the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" fansite). I didn't even know who Verhoever was, and the "A Star Trek" movie is such a cult classic, so I guess I shouldn't be expecting any great acting from this film. It's certainly one of the most over rated and controversial movies that has ever been released. So take it for what it is -- it's an honest attempt at comedy, and it's a comedy with an over-the-top villain who is the perfect villain for such a low budget film. The villain of the film is Verhoev's creation (a villain who can be best described as Verhoevers own version of himself), and who can't resist a good plot twist.but it's not a major part of the "mysteries." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's my own opinion that there is a lot more to the "real" world than is depicted here, and that it was never meant to be a definitive documentary film. My hope is that some kind of definitive film is made out of the material available from this film. A lot of people are still discussing it's potential. I think this has a lot of potential and is, but I do not think it's going to be "The Omen". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very happy to own the movie "Alvin Miller," a big fan of him (he was on the show with his character "Alvina Miller" and in my mind Alvin Miller is one of the best actors in the world.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For someone with high ambitions, like the creator, this is a low-brow project. The guy is no one's idea of a genius, and his own ideas are taken and manipulated for the better part of the next 20 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the reviews were very funny and didn't think that a movie is actually serious.  I didn't know the movie was supposed to be this serious. I watched it the other day and thought, "Wow, that's pretty serious." This movie is not funny or not well directed. It's very bad in several aspects. I had a hard time laughing, I think it's because it doesn't have a comedy writer (in English). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horror movie that has been made over the last 30 years or so, probably since "Halloween" has been released in the United States and other parts of the world (if you can find that film). You'll see it in the library of your university, and you'll be scared by itbutbutbutnot by the film itself.  I understand the argument that it's "a lot more" than an "80s" horror film, or, I don't know, a "Hollywood" film (which was released at the time of this review), and I understand why it could be seen as a very "modern" film, if you were to watch this movie on a "modern day" channel, which would probably appeal to my "modern age" audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To make matters worse, the cast was a true ensemble. But the movie had to play all the way to Japan, and I don't know how the director of it would have survived it. This movie didn't play in Tokyo, even though it was supposed to be on video at the video store. Also, the movie itself looks very good. The director's name was on the back of the DVD. It looks as if he's one of the Japanese directors. As you'll see below, this movie has very similar look to "Mystery Men". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that the director, or whoever he's working with, knows what he's doing and is on the same page with the others about what he needs from the movie.

As I've said, I've talked to a bunch of these actors, they've all done other movies and I'm sure they all got this movie for the same reasons. They're trying to get all of them into the same space for the movie and they'll probably have a big group on set and it won't take long to find people who are just all around them. And that's why they'll all go off and do their scenes because that's the way it was when they were actually trying to figure out the movie for me, in the same place. The scene was so awkward because everyone is off camera and in a scene with nobody there to see them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made in 1997 and is supposed to be about the movie that was released in 1994.  The "original" movie was about a teenager named Jack Burton and he was the main character. This movie is about a girl named Jackie who is about 10 years old, and her character is in the early 20's. If you look at this movie and try to figure out who the character was that was in "Jack Burton's movie", it is hard to figure it out. There was no sign of Burton in this movie (and it's very sad considering what he had done in the past). Burton is only appearing briefly and when he is there, he is in black leather jeans and a black shirt with a hoodie and there is no sign that Burton ever even got close to Burton's house, and what was supposed to show that Burton was staying at the Holiday Inn or Hilton, when the movie ended, there were no posters of Burton anywhere in the world. I'm sure it was only a short stint in the hotel room. If this movie is going to be made into a feature film, I'm hoping that they make this movie into a mini feature with Jackie and Burton in it. If I ever get that chance, this movie might be in good shape and we could watch it on the internet or something like that. If so, I would buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it should have been an A+ because at the end of the day it's a horror film. It was a lot of fun when the movie was made, like it was the year 1990, I think everyone from the actors to the director could do it again. But then again, maybe I missed something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an absolutely awful film. I have seen worse things on the video. It's almost impossible for a film to make it through, and the only way it was made into a short film was through the help of some really talented people. I'll leave you to do your own research and make the best of this piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was an interview. That means it could be that the director's wife/girlfriend was the interviewer. It could be someone else. I haven't gone into any deep detail because that's why I'm not an expert, but the point here is that it's very difficult to make the movie. To be honest, I don't think it's a good movie, and I don'st really know why someone would want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What the hell is this? This was the biggest disappointment of the whole movie. I didn't like the fact that he got drunk one time, and how he was a complete slob that day, and I don't like people's lack of respect for the whole world in terms of who he was and what he did. I know a lot about that world and I never got to know him, so I don,t think that it was my fault. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the first 90 minutes of this film, it was almost a comedy (or slapstick).   It's hard to tell what it was supposed to be. I found myself rooting for the bad guys (in one scene). The good guy was so stupid. I have no idea how he could survive in this film. How can you laugh, really. He's as dumb as a sack of paper. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really good and shows a few of the actors. It is very low budget, so some of the things mentioned (such as "waking up in the woods" and "hugging the woman" and things that I don't know what is happening at that part) are supposed to be true. "Lying on the floor" is a completely false statement, and the movie is very boring to watch and completely unrealistic. I've been trying to watch it over the past five years, and this film is just awful. I don' have time to waste my time or energy, and I had to watch this film in a theatre. It's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest, it's not that bad...  They got a lot of people in that movie because of "Survivors" and "Shawns" and people wanted to see those other two survivors. The movie doesn't really deal with the other two.  It also doesn't tell you what really happened to them.  They show what is written in the book and give a little bit about the people that were there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my fourth time seeing this film, and I'm looking at it as it's DVD release (like I did the first time). My friend, who is a film buff, has already given me the DVD, and if there is any chance that he or any of the other critics will rate this film with anything close to a five, he will be shocked at how terrible it is. The opening sequence is so bad it would be funny.  This movie is supposed to be a comedy. My friends and I were laughing hysterically at the very idea of this movie. It doesn't belong in a comedy! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main character is an idiot. He makes decisions based on luck. He's got a really bad character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To the film makers, they are an idiot.  I can't give them credit for that. If that were your only film, and it wasn't for the fact that they are in a movie with an actor that was in that movie, I would give this film 10 stars. It is bad. The film is not well done. The actors are bad. I will give it some credit for a "documentary" look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a good reason for the idea of this being a parody of an American movie.  This is the only thing about the movie that makes sense. I think I found the same thing in the first movie. I thought I had found some of these guys playing the villain. The "jungle guy" looks like a monkey, he doesn't look like a jungle person, and the "woman in the jungle" looks a bit like a woman.   I didn't like the final twist at all.  The end of the movie has a good story about some crazy person being in a mental institution, I guess they just added in a bit more violence and torture. "The guy who does the monkey" or "The girl who does it again".  The twist makes a great movie,butbut it's like that part in "The Naked Gun" with the girl in the forest. And if you find yourself watching this version, you may just "find yourself" there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as part of an independent film festival, where the festival is a one-night affair, and the movie was released on the DVD on July 10, 1999. The festival took place on Saturday and Sunday, July 11-12, 1999, and it is very possible that there was some overlap of my time as a participant at the festival, since I was able to talk to some festival people.  I have to admit that I didn't really watch this movie in the festival atmosphere, and I didn-t understand the entire point of it, but the movie is a sort of "prestige piece" which is very much a Hollywood type movie, and so it will play on the big screen.  If you can get a bunch of people together, you'll find them on film, at least those that aren't dead, and even if you watch it in that environment, they will try to act exactly as they did in the movie, the only difference being that they're older and probably older than the main cast of the film was when they made it.  You could imagine what would happen with an actor playing the role of "Billy," or "Danny," or other members of the main character's family who's still around, where it's not that bad. I haven't seen this movie yet, so I don't know if the film would have been so bad if it had been played in a "pistol" format. The character is completely wrong in every aspect. It isn't a horror film, it's a horror comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been watching this movie for two months. I've watched more than 50 films that are more extensive. This is not a real documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping the movie would at least make an impression on people who watched the movie and were friends with the actors and crew. I was in the theater when this movie was released and I've seen it in its entirety, and I can only say that it will do no harm to be honest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My best friend had suggested watching this film with me. I thought that, "a movie where we're all going to have fun" would be a great movie to see at the local movie theater. I didn't understand why the producers put so much effort into this film and it was soooooo annoying to watch it was absolutely terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to wonder, in light of the fact that some of the best directors of the day, if not the world, whether they were working at BVH or not, if this is the way they're going to do their work, then you may be asking yourself how one writer can, or why one person with a script in hand can do a good job as a storyteller.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this movie knowing what it was about. It's about people who live in the area. If you know the story of the movie or read the book, you know what happens to the people, and if you read the novel, you won't find any mention of this film. I did read that this film would make you think about what happened to those who live there. I'm sure the producers would rather have a little bit of this movie and not have people think what I just saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved that one.  It was a comedy. I don't know what happened to the movie. The last time I saw it was like 2004 and I think it was titled The End of an Era, so it's only 4 years ago. I have a feeling that it will have a horrible ending that everyone will watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What can be said that the movie has been "reviewed" by some of the "top film critics" from the west. This movie, while "filmed in Los Angeles", was made in the desert of Utah, and it's hard to know how well it was edited. The best way to show you all of this is to rent it again, because I haven't seen any of the trailers or any interviews about it (if you can figure out the way to rent the DVD or if there are any). I'll leave you with my personal review of this movie: "I'll say it again. I was really mad at myself for buying it. I thought it would be a big blockbuster movie with the big Hollywood stars, and then I would have to see it, and I really thought I was going to get a movie about a guy fighting off sandstorm and stuff." I can't give it another rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts on the same day as the original "Giant Days" (September 18, 1976) and is playing off of the idea that it's "Gigantic" big. We see this movie in the spring, where I was living back then in San Francisco. I would be glad to watch the original film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was released on VHS. The VCR was the standard in these days, so let's go with that.  This movie was on videotape, which means it only cost around $1.00 or so, with no promotional support. I'm not trying to bash this movie, just trying to keep in mind that if the movie had some sort of promotional video, then it would have already been released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was going to be like a movie that was released during the summer, where it would be a summer's movie, like a bunch of other "kids" movies with actors and actresses in their 20's (in the U.S.)  I really want to laugh at the stupidity of people that watch this, because it really is a kids' movie. You know, one of those movies with a few songs by the "kids". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard about this movie on the radio, and I figured I was at least going to see the director. This is probably the worst of the three films (though not a bad film by any means, just not good) to say the least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a good movie, movies that are not about religion and have to do with the truth and love. I'm glad that there are a lot of religious movies out there that are about love and peace and so I will not hold the movie against the fact that it is about someone having love for but rather, I just don't really get into the movie (maybe it's just me, maybe it's a matter of my own stupidity). I don't like this movie because it's bad, not because of the truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is, according to the IMDB, the third straight film by director Paul Schrader, and that should make a difference when it comes to the quality of the film.  Schrader has not even been nominated for his film debut, let alone for another feature. The film starts out looking like it was a comedy with two friends, one of whom works on a sketch comedy TV show called "Spin City" and the other of whom is best known for his first two film "Citizen Kane", which he wrote, directed and starred in. He's not an actor, and I don't think he's ever been an actor. I don. Schrader's own voice can be heard in the very first scene of this film, and the one person I saw him appear in that day was the one who plays John Thaw, the film's writer and producer.  As an artist and filmmaker, he did create a great character and interesting storyline for the "Clerks", which was very good for that film, in the first installment.  He's created a wonderful character for John Thaws in the "Spinner" film, but he has been given no time to create his own character for this film. So there are two main reasons why I think he wrote his book. One is that he wants to be famous, as he does in the book, and he is quite talented in that regard. The other is that it's difficult for me to relate to this character.  A great, interesting character was created for John Thurman in "Spiner" in the film, who was very likable and in love with his daughter. He has a very close relationship with the Thurman family and the Thurmans are one of the reasons that would make this character so fascinating, even better than this one. The Thurman children are adorable, just look at them, and we would all be just like them. Schrack, in his own way, has a great mind and he can create characters. You've seen his own "Dinosaur" character in the early 90's, for example, and how he created the character of "Logan", an incredibly likable character. He should be able to create a wonderful, complicated character for his next venture. I just don't see the point in doing this kind of film, because I'm sure it would end up being better than it is at this point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the other reviews I thought I was in for a pleasant afternoon and a break to read a book. Well, this is a very poor, very bad movie. I would rate it as an 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's been almost five years since the first of these movies (the first one was released in 1992) and that movie is still available on the video store.   I had the opportunity to watch the original film in London (the London premiere).  And it was the first film, it had only one scene and it was about half an hour long.  You know, I've always been a big, enthusiastic movie lover, and the first time I watched this I was pretty thrilled to be able to watch it, I was looking forward to seeing a modern-day version of the first movie, and I'd like to see one, because I'm a big fan of the original.  And if the producers of this version really had hoped to see my reaction, they'd have got it by now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry. This is the most poorly acted movie I've ever seen. I swear it was terrible.   It made you think it was funny.  Don't. You just have to hope that it is the worst movie ever made, like the other movie. I wish I knew what was going on in this movie. The only good thing in this was that the movie is not about suicide. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is more about "relief" than "relieve" and in that regard makes you wonder why it took the time out of my life to make this film (I can't even get into it). The filmmakers themselves seem to be getting so comfortable in their own mind they've been able to forget the concept of telling the audience how to really think about the movie. They've gone beyond the movie that they're supposed to be a "film about" and so many are now asking me, "Did the film teach me anything in regards to how to survive off the land, how to make fire, how it can be used to create shelter, how all these things are needed in order to make a living for me in the wilderness."  To those who might say that a film like this would give me some useful tips and teachings, I suggest you take some time out to actually go and live in the wilds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just happened to stumble onto this movie at an unadvertised time, and it was so good that I'm just curious to find out what happened. I had to catch this movie with my roommate because he knew what it was. And of course I like my roommate and he likes my roommate. And he knew that there was no chance that this movie would be bad. So I had high expectations for it. I thought I was going to see something like "The Office," and now it's out, because of course it would be.  It is also disappointing because of the story. I wish they were honest enough to tell the audience how things are like in real life, because at least then it would make sense. The movie begins with a girl who is very pretty (you would like her and I'm sure that this is a completely honest and honest movie) and later on in the movie, I could see that the girl's family was really upset about their daughter, and she is going to have to learn that you shouldn't be giving away all of your heart to a man (or a family member), that she should let her parents down, or she will be in for a life changing experience. It is the same story that is told in this movie. If you are a woman with a man, it's basically, "I'd like to be a girl," and if you are not. The girl's parents aren't in the picture, and you know how hard it is for people to take the initiative and be honest with their families, and give them the benefit of the doubt, the girl goes along with the parents' plan. And it goes against the entire spirit of the movie.  I won't lie that I was pretty upset when the movie was over, I was a total skeptic that this story would end up being a "happy ending," and I just finished watching this movie, so I know that I am not alone in this. This is not a movie that makes sense, and at times, you have to question whether the movie really is made by real people or it is a movie made by actors. It was a completely awful, terrible movie. It had everything to do with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and it is made up by this writer who is only a friend of the writer for the first part of the movie. They're both in town for two days, and the first time I saw this movie it was "The Writer's Diary". The movie is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's an entire section devoted to it in this one movie, and if I'm being really honest, the movie itself, the acting, just isn't good.  I found myself thinking of why it's called a horror movie in the first place.  The movie is about the "twins" and their family members (i.e. the "family resemblance"). And the twins are the best of the lot. They're really pretty. The twins were very pretty. They were attractive to look at, and had long hair, so it made it seem like they had very attractive families. I'm sure that there are people out there who look at the twins, and think they're pretty hot and pretty. This is because I've only seen them in the original film, so I'll be honest, I'm an adolescent male, so my brain doesn't think that they're attractive at all, and it's obvious, for those who see them, that they would be the twins who were born without their mother, so if you're looking at the movie as a movie about the original "twin", or the "sisters", then go ahead and watch it, because they are, as I said, very pretty, and beautiful. They have beautiful blue eyes. If you look at them like the twins do, in that way, they would have looked a bit like the "little sisters". That's how they look to me. The movie was made for an adult male viewer. They'd have probably been very interested in how the twins looked, and the whole experience would have been much more interesting and enlightening.  It was made by the American public, at least as it's released to the public.   I know, I've seen the first film, and I just didn't find the movie to be that good, as well. I think there are some pretty great movies out there. I can't recall them all, they are on my VHS collection, so go out and rent them, because the movie is not really suitable for children at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd love to see the other half of this movie, as it was written and produced and edited by my good friend, David Orenstein. I'd really like to know if this movie was produced by David O'Neill, and if this is his first or second effort, I have no idea. I'm a fan of David OReilly, his films, and the people involved with his work, and I'd definitely be interested to see more of his films. I do hope that this movie would be available on DVD or other format, because if this doesn't, I would be really sad, and it is the first piece I've seen from him in three years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the film for the "drama class" that is run on the college campus. It will be presented on the screen for all of our fellow college students, but I don't think it is something that the college film student would want to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why they did this. They should stick to their true calling as doctors who treat patients. If you have ever watched a documentary, you know that if you go into a doc, you can make the decision that you would like to see happen. You have just to show some compassion, and they should show that they didn't do their homework. They don't know exactly how to treat the patient in a doctor's way, and their treatment is completely unacceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For a person that has been in this business for 20 years, the fact that this movie is so very VERY very very very VERY VERY very, well that's a no-brainer to me. It's got to be a movie that the audience is really, really, into, and that the director has to know what he is doing, and has got to know a few things about making horror movies. That he isn't making a film that is very popular among the crowd at the moment, or that it is going to appeal to a big crowd like "Silent Hill". I'm really not interested in this film, and for all its flaws I would rather watch it to be on tape.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few people have suggested that the film was directed by a woman. I didn't find this film funny, funny, or even funny at all. There was no plot to be told. I found it strange that there was a guy on the back of a bus. The guy was so far away from the bus.  A woman I had just been with a few minutes prior to this was just as funny and charming, and just as sweet as her husband. He just walked away from me at the end of the film. When he saw me on the bus, I thought it was a good idea to walk on and then back in his direction. I was so disappointed. This is a real tragedy that I really hope the two leads got the most out of their careers. I can't recommend this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is completely unbelievable. It makes no sense.

And there were a few times when some of the film's directors made statements about eating less or no soy.  My main comment in this film is that this film was filmed in a manner that was very close to the "SOS" television program on the late 90s. That is, that the "foodies" are probably the type of people who watched "Sos" regularly and had their own DVD set (or something of that nature). Also, "Sorcha" was one of those movies that was never released, so you can say that "Sorscha" may have some food in his refrigerator, but there are other aspects of his life and character that were probably more likely to be filmed in such a manner. The other aspect that I will say is that the film was supposed to be about "surviving" on Soylent Island. So I guess it would have been kind of funny to say "Soros Island" or something. I'm just a dumbass, and am the one who must live on this horrible island. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched a lot of movies, and I don't believe this movie is suitable for viewing. The movie is all about the girl (and there are some great, honest, sensitive parts about the relationship between the girl and her father), and I hope that the film would be a little more about the boy, with the little boy (or father, or sister) of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had the same title as "The Blue Planet" for the whole movie, and the plot of "The planet" would be a comedy.  It would be like someone getting a taste of a movie: I gave it 5 stars because it was a sequel to "The Planet." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen other actors, actors who have played some of these people, and they were good. This is a low budget film with a fairly low budget and a very low budget production and I found it difficult to find any of the actors in the movie, I didn't like the casting of the "hero" (the main character) and I had some fun in the casting process and the "main" hero was the same as in the previous film in terms of "the good guys" who were good guys, the "villain" was the main hero's arch-nemesis (the "hero's" arch-enemy) and the main villain was the hero of the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts as a comedy because it will be easier to take to the theatre and get in. It is really sad and pathetic.  The only funny part is the girl who is in the bath tub in the shower while she is naked in the tub, who is naked underneath the shower and it is just about an hour long, plus it's a pity that I didn't want to see this movie with my boyfriend and friends who were laughing at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending credits are all wrong and the movie is just plain awful. The movie isn't even a parody anymore. I can't recommend it to anyone, and it is just horrible. There is no reason why the movie was made in the first place. It is not a film worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do know that this is not intended as a real movie, and I am pretty sure that the actors were on a budget or something else entirely and that they were in a movie theatre somewhere. I did see some movie clips on the internet and I thought that they would at least have had a sense of humour about this. I can't really blame the movie for being a "low budget" or even a movie in the theatre, although it could use some editing and I hope I don't lose out on any money. The movie starts off with an opening that is supposed to give it the "spirit of a movie" (i.e., the idea that this movie will be some sort of "journey to another planet or something" or something like that) and there are a bunch of very boring and very bad actors.  The movie begins to "talk" about the "good old days of Hollywood" and about how "they" have the same problems that we do, which, like I said, is really dumb, and not at all a very good excuse to get people to see the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was originally shot in the Netherlands, where it was not supposed to be an art film. The story was originally about a female Dutch film star who was to star in it as the "mother" of the film. When the film was re-edited, they added a whole new plot and a whole bunch of new characters, but those who don't know Dutch history, or who are unfamiliar with Dutch films, may not understand why the original story was made. I have tried my best to explain the situation here, as best I can, and am writing a negative comment about a good movie: Because it is not about the Dutch film industry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with my husband when he went to get married to me at an art museum in Kansas City, where I have seen the original, which was on videotape, I was in town with a group of friends for a bachelor party and our group got together to watch the movie, and the whole thing has been pretty much the same. There are so many things to be wrong with this movie that it's amazing that I made it through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out as a series of five short documentaries about the people of the island, who are supposedly the main characters in the film. It is a film about the islanders, who actually live on the island now, as the island has never been colonized. The movie is also very heavily influenced by European films, which were, as you may have heard, a major influence of Hollywood at the turn of the 20th Century, so it was a big hit back then.  The islanders have very strange characters. They have a man who looks like he is mentally disabled, or a totally mentally ill individual, with absolutely no discernible motivation for life whatsoever. There is one woman who is an idiot and who is obsessed with the island. The island itself is completely devoid of any actual value, so much so that I actually felt bad when I was watching the movie, and I felt even worse when it was over. I don't know if the island looks like it's supposed to be a big, barren island in a scene, or if it was simply because of some of the effects, or it's all because of the "film" as it was made. I guess there's also a lot of it in the movie and it's hard to resist the movie in its attempt to appeal to "everybody". I suppose it's also the sort of movie that you can only enjoy once, so, let's go with it, because there's no point in being too critical about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a comedy. I have seen many movies that are comedies, or just comedy in general. A comedy is a very different genre of movie than the "funny" films that have come out in the past. My expectations of what a movie would be (a good comedy) were higher than what was being shown to me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read some of the comments here, and even though I was only 9 years old, I remember how much I was involved in the film when I was younger and even when I'm old enough, the movie is too dark, too bleak, too depressing. It's very disappointing, and the film is just about the "big bad guy". There's only one scene in the movie (about 30 seconds) that actually shows the good guy, and it was very poorly done, and you get to see the bad guy's evil face all the time, which I don't think that would have been a good idea, at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is my second movie, i'm also a person who loves movies and movies are supposed to be about two things, one of them is romance and love and love. This movie is basically a love-but-never-sex-and-love movie. This is not a good movie. I don't have anything to say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a huge respect for the work of "The Office" and I thought the show would do something different, that show would have a different show in my opinion. I would love to see the "Office" writers work on this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are terrible!  I have read some good reviews from others about this movie, i was hoping for some insight into this, i am going to continue to read the book, I really don't know how they got the good reviews, I honestly was hoping to watch a real, honest, honest version of this. I thought that the movie would be more like a documentary about a real story about the life of a real person, a real family, a man who truly understands what it is like to be a true, ordinary person, this is not a documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into the movie expecting a comedy movie and just because I'm old and am an old comedian does not mean I need to sit down and really think about this movie or I'm afraid. The director is a young man who came from New York and was a filmmaker himself before he made this movie. He is also in the middle of a career transition which means he is trying to make his movie, too, the same as he made his own movie, which is not a good idea and I am the type of person who is really quick to jump on the right train, so I thought he would do this movie on a Friday night. I do not want to ruin this movie for him and give it away to a bunch of people because he is really young. I can't say it has been a success because of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a big Hollywood studio that is going to make "The Great Movie" you are probably going to think that I am making a big hit.  I guess that I should be worried because of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the way they portray the characters in the series, the main problem is that the show is made on an Indian canvas. As it was in the early days of the series (as it was filmed in the Indian countryside) this time around, the camera crew were forced to shoot a flashback, a pre-existing show and show, "The Indian Wars", in the middle of the night (night). The show's lead producer, Sam Simon, has said in the past that he'd like to show the actual Indian Wars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many good, well written, well directed and intelligent films that are out there. I thought that this would be the film about me, where I was going to get some information about the life of my favorite actor, or something to help me understand him better, the idea was for a very good film, a movie that would tell us about life with my beloved character, and to show that the life with Mr. McQueenbut here we find out about what his life was like before he decided to do this horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't believe that they used a real actress in their acting.  That would ruin the movie, for any reason. I'm just saying the movie wasn't "real", it wasn't very good. The story didn't have anything to do with the characters, or, you know, who they are.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I got off the phone with the casting agency and saw the movie, I was very shocked at the "top" level. I have seen many movies of "top level" talent and this is by far the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie. The film is an insult to a good movie like "Little Miss Sunshine" from 10 years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never seen an episode of this show, but I don't care about this show. It may get cancelled or get turned into a TV movie, and maybe it should. A lot of people would probably like to see how bad this show is or the "Drama" it has. I don to pay it any attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best way to describe this movie is "butchered."  The only good way I can come up with this film is a really good one that is probably happening in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with a female lead, and a little girl.   This movie starts off with a male lead and two male leads.  It's odd that I found the movie so boring. It's not as bad as it could have been because there is nothing more to do than sit there for hours and hours.  I'm no genius and I knew that there are plenty of movies out there that were directed by men. I saw "Losing" and didn't think it was awful, and "Dog Days", and even had the movie been about a week before I'd be in front of a camera.  There is a reason why they don't let the world know about this movie. I don't care what anyone says about it being "a "thriller" or "a real film". The guy who made this movie must be very bored himself. He must've been extremely bored during filming and directing this movie, and he didn't even get a refund because his movie was so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure it has many redeeming qualities. Maybe we were talking about that at the beginning.  I didn't know that we would be talking about our own lives in this movie. I'm just one of the people who are involved in the project, and I'm also supposed to be some kind of expert who can determine whether this movie is about to be a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the main reasons for watching this movie was that the book was an excellent film. And for those who have read the book, you'll understand that it's not that simple. The book is actually an excellent book, and there is nothing in this movie that would make it look good, or even worth my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it's funny (no really funny, though). My opinion is that I think the director tried to do this movie justice by doing some research on this subject. I give this movie a 1 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been lucky to have watched many movies, and I do not believe that many people have seen the whole picture or have been told the whole story. I did watch the preview for this film on the Internet.    The entire story is told from the standpoint of a couple in a hotel room. Not the standpoint as it should be told. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a weird film, in the sense that it is a real weird film...  I have been interested in seeing a real Weird film, the kind that is completely and utterly bizarre and I have seen a lot of those movies, like for example, "the first one", which is basically the film's origin. This film is very strange. You really don't know what you're in for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it is obvious, but that movie was made before the new studio and the budget was probably smaller, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, including the "bad movie" genre, and have seen it.  The bad movie genre is the type of films that are completely made of trash, and are so bad they're good for laughs. I saw the "good" movies, and found them to be good movies, for me and for you. So if you like "good movies", you might have some fun watching them. If you like the bad movie that it's in now, or the one in the movie, I guess it's a sign that I'm some kind of weirdo or weird friend, I'm very sorry for the rest of you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the film goes on it is obvious that the director is trying to make a film about the'man who killed' that is the killer. And this movie is all about the killer, not about the guy who killed, so the movie will be the first time you see him in this film. The story isn't about that guy, who had a real impact on society as a guy who was known as 'The Killer' in the 80s and 90s, this is a movie that is about a killer, and he's not a good killer. He has no real connection to the character he should be in. In the scene where he kills the woman in the house, he's a good guy. He kills her, and tries to protect her. He's trying to get information out of her, but he kills a good number of people in the movie, who just didn't die like in the film. He gets killed off by the bad guy in the end, and the good guy (Dennis Haysbert) gets tortured by the good guys for no good reason. If you want to read the book, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had this movie since 1996 and watched it on HBO the other day, and I can tell you that the movie is about 12 years old. Not to be ridiculous and to make light of the situation, if that is.  If you're a parent, you would be disappointed with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a sucker for that. I know you think this is going to be a movie with some of the big stars, and that this was directed by a big name like Louis Lasseter, I have to admit, I'm not going to go out of my way to find the best actor in the world. As is the case with many movies, the stars are not the only ones involved, it's a serious topic to write about and I have no intention of writing about it here. I don't think it would be right. The only person I trust to do this right is Louis Lisseter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really not a fan of "The Ring" or "The Return of the King". If I ever did see any of these two films, they were either made to be a trilogy or were made in a similar way to the first "Ring" and the "Return of the Kings". That means that the director wanted me to see this movie because it's supposed to be the first of the two.  And although he did promise me a "great" movie, he did actually make it sound like it was going to be one of the great movies and I was really hoping that this was going on a similar level as the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I went in, I knew nothing about the movie (I was really looking forward to a'real' thriller about a killer stalking somebody through the wilderness in the mountains of Montana). I thought I was going to be seeing a very cool movie with a killer who is stalking some pretty attractive people who could have some fun and be chased, perhaps kill some animals (which is a really dumb idea anyway).  I also had to endure the obnoxious 'good guy' talking and acting of this movie, which was not even very good in the least part, and it seems the movie was only really made in the last 30 years or so, so that's how bad it got (and I do mean bad). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the "Eternal Sunshine" movie--which was a romantic film about the sun and the moon--and "Crimson Peak" has a very good cast, but the one thing that keeps me away from this film is the story itself. The movie is a romantic comedy. There are also some very sexy ladies--so I just wanted to watch this with my date. As I am not a very open person, I don't think it would be very "sexy". I guess you would have to watch the movie with a friend of mine and I am sure we would all like to watch it again! :) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is too easy. I tried to make this movie last night after it's short run, and even the movie was not that bad, the guy should have been able to see that the movie is a "real" one. And as it is, I can only recommend that he watch it on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always loved the characters from the first two films. The characters of this one were so terribly written, the character who was supposed to be a young man (Trent), was a child who didn't even turn six, and the actors weren't bad actors, but rather childlike and stupid. I mean, it's like a real life episode. It's really hard to even see the resemblance of an old person and then imagine them having a family life. The show really doesn't even have a good ending to the episode, and that is not the only reason why I don't think that the show was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To say that it is a remake of The Sound of Music is absurd. I was shocked when I saw that the composer of this film was credited with composing the film. The film is so slow paced. I think that I watched it five or six times before, and it's hard to say who's fault this is. The movie really reminded me of a really awful comedy I was a teen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know a lot of people love John Carpenter and go on about his films, and that makes me feel even more foolish for watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My opinion is that this movie was a waste of time. There is a good guy in there somewhere, who is a veteran. This film was an hour long.  There was a great chance for a good film with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do understand that this is my second movie. I can only imagine that people have to get back into shape after a long hiatus and it's my own fault for sitting out in the heat all day. And it was also the day that I first saw this, so I had my phone on and was listening to some music. I had to look for this movie and I can't get it and it doesn't have a DVD cover either. It's just like a lost movie. And I was also very angry at how the director made the movie and made a few other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been so painful to watch, and it makes no sense at all. I am really sad about this movie, and I really hope I can find the movie itself, so I am going to go into the studio and hopefully find something I can watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not an actor. I'm a writer. That's what I used to write. I didn't like that at all, and that's one of the reasons why I didn the movie came out on DVD.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting in this movie is about on par with "the other" (although a good few people still seem to enjoy the great acting that was done in "Dawn of the Dead" and the great role that Robert Wagner had played in the original "Dawson's Creek". This is pretty much an updated version of that movie with a few minor tweaks here and there. The movie's director's own take on the events of the movie, is that it will be a "zombie-film" which was based on "Dance of the Vampires", which is another film that was based loosely off the events from "The Walking Dead", with a bit of gore thrown in there.  I was not sure if the film was going to be a comedy, horror, drama, drama/horror, or just a "walking movie", and since I can't remember my preferences (and they are very important for a film to keep in mind here), I chose to watch it, and to be honest, I don't like it, I really don't. I was hoping it would be a horror/comedy, a "post apocalyptic" film, or a "Zombie comedy" since that is what the film is called in the credits, and I believe the movie is pretty faithful to the TV show in those regards, and that it would make me feel as if I were actually living through one of the zombie-days (something similar to the "zombies" seen in the movie), or seeing one or the other, and in the "Dancing with the Vamps" scenario, or whatever. In "The Dancers", it feels very fake, and very unauthentic. It's not a really funny movie, I was disappointed by it and feel like I have to make more of an effort than just a dumb laugh or a mindless "Zom-Zom" type comment I usually try to make in these things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing about 'The Thing' that got it made, is the fact that it is a movie made by Universal, who had the rights to the movie for 15 years, they also have rights for a sequel to the original. So that is what is happening with this one, and yes, there was a very good reason for making a sequel, that is when there was interest to continue the story of 'The Strangers'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good review about the movie being about the "real" world gives you a sense of what kind of film this is.  The movie was filmed in a very small country (Argentina) with no sound (no dialogue) and was only shown on video for the last week or so. That is really depressing and makes the movie all the worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad I'm not in a movie right now.  I want to say that I had fun reading a book about this.  And that's why I enjoyed reading it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people have commented on this movie before and I don't know why. What does the director know that all the other cast members, directors, or writers? This movie was filmed in Canada and the people who live in it. That means that it's going to be a bit more difficult for some people to adjust to some of the quirks of Canadian culture.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What really saddens me is that people I know have talked about it. I'm not sure that everyone is in a state of mind to even consider watching this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really weird, and weird to me as a kid, but it was good to have a movie with Tom Hanks and a movie called "Tom Hanks". It is pretty interesting that the movie went on a quest, and we get to know the people in the town (in the town), but it's not exactly the sort of movie that was meant to be released to the public.  I think this was released in 1970, or perhaps 1971, and there were actually two movies with the same name, and this is the one that has been released, which is probably a good comparison for comparison sake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing I hated the most was the one where I'm going to walk off and pretend to be dead, and that was the last one where it happened so I don't really know what else I can say. The thing with the movie is that it's trying to be a horror movie. It's been described as a "love story", which is why I don of like it, because of the way the movie ends. I'm sorry I couldn't stay to watch it last night when it was so good. I was very curious about what was going to happen to the characters, to see how the characters would react and would I like them to have a happy ending.  This movie is about a "drama" or a "comedy". It's about a guy who's going to die and so it ends up in that genre, and so that's a little sad and disappointing. It might be that he died during the movie, in a "twilight" type way where it ends with him in heaven and is happy with his life and family.  I'm not saying that this movie wasn't interesting, in that respect I have no doubt that it was very good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As is typical for this type of film, when you watch it on the big screen it's at least somewhat close to the true story. This film is a far cry from it's subject matter. The film starts in the mountains, has a rather lame hero, and a weak supporting cast. The cinematography, photography, lighting, and sound effects all pale in comparison to the movie that came out on VHS back in '95. I'll give credit to a few "cult films" that have been re-released and some are actually pretty good. The idea behind this film is to recreate the feeling of going to see "Night Gallery" in the early '90s, i.e. to watch a 70's style horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie on TV, and I would be quite surprised if it was the only one, and to me it seems that it is quite an eclectic collection of films, from period pieces to low budget stuff. This movie was the first film, so I would assume it was a lot more expensive to make, maybe in the tens of millions of dollars. There are so many movies out there, in which the makers don't have a lot of control over what they put in their own films. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to this movie, it's just an over the top thriller, which I'm not really a big fan of, and what they are trying to do is try and be cute with this one, because the other movies are more cute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a group of girls who are trying to kill a serial killer, and it should take up 90% of the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all the director claims he got the script straight from the French. I'm sure it was more of a translation job than what I am assuming. I believe he got it straight from an unknown, French translator. I was very curious if any American-born Frenchmen would come forward and give their opinion on this film since it's such a strange French film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first film, which was made for a couple of years and had great reviews, I thought that a movie would be a movie and be about love and peace. I must say that this movie was made just so that it could cash in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is basically a parody of the classic "The Ten Commandments" or the "Three Pillars of the Faith" of the Holy Scriptures (the Hebrew Bible). It is unfortunate that this is not just a comedy movie, as I have heard horror movies that were very good in comparison. It is best to look at this movie to see if there is a comedy, or if it is a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched a film like "Tales of Aladdin" last year and I didn't have any problems with it, so I thought I would just go out and rent another bad movie.  This movie has its own special effects and was produced on a small budget and I can't really recommend it to anyone who wants to see some quality entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the "Citizen Kane" film and it is probably one of the best films ever made. I was a member of the jury at the New York Film Festival and one of those film festival filmmakers had one of his films up for the Jury and he put a great performance on it had the same director.but this one is about to be released as a "video" feature on the internet and I am curious as to why it wasn't released on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are plenty of critics out there that think this movie is pretty good.  This movie is a complete mess. There are so many bad scenes (many bad shots, many bad actors). This movie made the original, and was the "classic" of the series. This remake has no redeeming value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're from the UK, you'll be able to relate to this movie, but in other countries the movie would be dubbed so badly that they wouldn't be able talk. I had the movie in my local video store for 7 days before I was sent this movie. If you know me, you know what kind of person this is, so if you want to watch this movie you might just keep it at home. I will say that I don't see why a guy who likes this movie would feel the need to review it. It's the last thing that I expect from this movie because it is not in any way worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the film yesterday, then I watched it again yesterday. It's probably only about a quarter of the film... there is not a lot of action in this movie... it was pretty bad at the beginning, but I'll give it some credit, since it's still the beginning of the movie, so it can't have all of its bad early episodes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A short film made by David Waver in 1976 is an ideal model to look at for this analysis. (I was so surprised how well this analysis could work)  I can't see how this short could possibly be made into a feature film. It's completely unbelievable! I'm a big believer in people and their ability to make movies. I was so angry watching it! I would have taken my wife's advice and said, "Oh, you don't think so, don't you?" A small movie, and the movie ends right when I say "they're just getting started." The same "feel good" feeling I experienced watching that short is all I got from this short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read the script and have seen the film. There is no "movie" and I don't think there ever will be any sort of film release. We all get to be in court and have our day in court. What's this "debt" that everyone is fighting for in this "thing"? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a movie is supposed to be, a person's opinion might be taken on the fact that this is a movie about a man.  This movie is actually about a girl that's played by Lela Roch on the TV series "Beverly Hills Housewives". I don't think this is something that a girl can really relate to, and the movie only lasted like an hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a sort of sequel to the second film, because they're all sort of sort of sequels to each other.  A very long time has passed since the second movie, and it was only the first film that I watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the original TV series and have never seen an episode where all the characters and situations were on the same level of the TV series, so it would have been nice to watch these shows as a part of the same TV series. I'm really looking for someone to write a positive review about this show,but alas, this is really just a one-hour piece which features all the actors for one reason or another appearing together in the same place. All of the characters appear to have a little bit of an age gap which, to be honest, doesn't make any sense when the show is in its original television format. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm an actor, a filmmaker, a critic. This film isn't really a serious documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is set in the 1970's, but since it's so long, I didn't like it. In the book, it's narrated by Paul Auster (who narrates the books). Auster's narration is so wonderful in the film (in the novel, he just does a very good job, in fact, I just love the book), and since he just did an excellent job, I wanted to watch his narration again, but the film was narrated by Jack Nicholson. It's interesting to hear Nicholson give a voice to the character and to see him use the voice that was used in the book.  Jack Nicholson is an Oscar-winning actor who is just wonderful in butbutbutbutBUTbutbutButbutbutyetbutbut butbut but but he was using the same voice as he did in the novel (which is Jack Nicholson's voice). Since this film was shot on celluloid, I don't think he was given the right actor to do his narration. He's just awful. If you've ever seen a silent film, you'll understand what I'm talking about. Even if you're into this sort of thing, you'd probably just walk away.   It's just bad, horrible. And it doesn't make any sense. The movie should be about a bunch of lies that happened in this stupid film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is called "The Biggest Movie of All Time", and it really looks like it would be one of those "T.V.H.B" type of movies with 20-25 minutes of screen time.  There are really too many characters and the movie just doesn't end. The ending has really bad acting and I was really upset when I watched the film for the first time, so I would like to explain the ending with a lot of detail. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was made in 1982 when I was 14, and I remember it being made in L. I think maybe it was made at a different location, and maybe that might have been a better idea. Maybe it was all filmed in one city.  My grandmother lived in the suburbs of Boston, which is about an hour from the movie set, and she would have been able to watch the movie with us for a few hours, so I just happened to watch it at the Boston Theater.  The people who knew that it was going to be a family film came into the theater and were totally bewildered by the scene. I don't understand how they made it.  I didn't understand why they felt it necessary to make a "family film", it was horrible. If you can't stand to watch a film in that condition, don't watch it. The worst movie I have ever seen. This movie is really really awful, it's so bad that if you give it a rating, it is an 8. It is actually worse than "Shakespeare's Romeo". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well the movie starts out on one of the most promising fronts. I thought it was going to be a low-budget "citizen of the world" film, the fact that it has all the "credible" actors who play in the movie indicates that it was intended for a low budget movie. Well, even though there are some excellent people in the US military (such as Lieutenant Colonel Scott Davis and Major Scott Hartsock), it is hard to compare the quality of the rest of the movie. I did not feel that it had the same quality as a John Carpenter film, and I know that a lot of "serious" film-goers would probably think that it did, and might be angry about that, so this is not meant to be meant as a critical review of the film, just in general, in terms of the quality as far as story and butchered dialog. I give this review an "9." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read about people who don't care about movies, and they may be the only person who cares about movies. There's still a whole world out there. I'll tell you who I found: A lot of people who have never liked this movie.  I'll give you a few reasons why they may have liked it, and I'll try to break them down to make it short. They may have been good actors. I've seen them in more movies than not, or at least, I know them. I'm just not someone who finds themselves in the mood to watch it again, if you get my drift. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I have some experience and what I think about this movie. When it was first released I remember it being a very serious comedy, and if the movie were released today, it would be very bad for the two reasons mentioned in the title, and it wasn't just because of me. It was not because of some poor actor, and I would hope that I was alone in this opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that makes a statement. When it isn't so.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I was about to see this movie, I happened to catch it on DVD, and I thought I'd take the chance of seeing it at home. And I must admit that I had the film sitting in the DVD case, and that I did not expect it to be a lot longer than it was. And if you were expecting a 90 minute movie, you'd be surprised at how much longer it was, because the DVD release was about 4 1/2 hours. I've seen the director make a 90 minutes documentary about "Alvin Toaster" and it was just like that. I must say, this was the biggest piece of crap film I've ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's been so much written about the relationship between the actors and the story being told by the first film, and this movie is a remake of the movie "The Man From Tomorrow". And if you go by the reviews here and elsewhere, you'll see that this remake is just a remake. It could of course be more accurate. The Man From Yesterday was a very faithful remake, but was very accurate in explaining the Man from Tomorrow's history and origins, whereas this new remake just shows that it's "man in the future", and that's the end result.  This is not a movie that anyone should have to spend time with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a believer in the power of movie magic and when I saw that the movie was to be based on this, I couldn't help but pity the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To put this movie into context, this is a horror movie that is not rated R in any of the major film review websites, in either the US or the UK. This movie has been released on DVD, in the US, by the distributors for the past four or five years.   It is an absolutely horrible horror, and it's an insult to every man that's ever been in this movie, and the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves, and should really just give this movie away for free to any one who will see this thing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a disaster. The script was awful. I was expecting some awful movie and I was wrong. This movie tries to do a remake of 'The Naked Gun' and I would suggest it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a horror film. That's the only reason I watch it now and then. I'm giving it 10.  I have no idea if the film-maker, director, or producer knew what a horror movie was about. I found myself cringing on a number of occasions throughout the film and that was in the movie. (There were many, many scenes of very disturbing and disturbing images. That is the kind of stuff that a horror-film should be). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first viewing was very different: I saw a comedy about two guys who became friends in a very unlikely scenario. I thought they would be more optimistic. I've come to expect the unexpected in my movies, and this film is no exception. The characters are basically bad actors. One character's daughter is very attractive, and another character is very unattractive.   The guy who plays the character "John" in the movie is absolutely disgusting, and I know that it's an adult film, and that he's a father-to-be. He's got his own film coming out in September with this sequel. He was very much like his character in "A-Team" in "Air Force One."   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did find myself watching this movie on the television.  If you can imagine that... It was an extremely depressing movie.  I found the ending... completely ridiculous and pointless. I felt it was just a rip-off of the movie. I have seen it at another time and I did enjoy it. This is a movie that doesn't deserve the time of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first episode had the good idea that they'd tell the story of the two families. This episode is like a sequel. It's just a bad and depressing episode, I don't want to give this episode more than two hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this movie, it's probably a week since it was first released in the UK, and I remember having this movie in my DVD collection on VHS, this movie was the equivalent of the first one, so in this one I've seen some of the actors and they do sound quite similar, for example in the British accent, and it certainly doesn't take away from the fact that these two actors were once friends, or that they both go by the name "Piers Morgan". I know that in the US they're both known as "PJ", and on TV they're supposed to be PJ Morgan and "Penny", although I've only seen them in the movies and I'm pretty sure this is how they were known in England, or at least that was the only way they were given names by the BBC. "Paddy" has been around a lot longer, and he also appears in this movie.  And that's the extent of the similarities. If you were to take a stroll down the street in London with both of them, you would see them. I can't imagine a TV or DVD producer letting me watch this movie again. I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is hard to describe how bad this film is. The only way I will describe it is truly awful. The acting is absolutely terrible, pathetic, horrible, terrible, horrible. They try to be cute and naive and so are awful and just as bad as they were in the first film.  It's awful, horrible and disgusting in every way possible. It's like a terrible horror flick. The whole premise of the movie is that this is a cute little film that would be funny to watch.  This film is like the second or third version of "Night of the Living Dead."  It must be a horror film. This is just a "film" that was produced for money, and it doesn't deserve to exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got off the phone with my friend, this movie is on my way and I will give it credit, I was actually in the same boat and watching this movie on my local TV station. My only positive review for that is that I will have seen a few episodes of this movie before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens in a desolate area and a little girl's head pops up. It's a dead little girl, but she gets up and heads toward a town and then she gets hit by a car and is killed. The woman, who is the "girl," appears to have become the woman of the film because her face is very young. She's just a woman and nothing special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like Robert DeNiro in The Godfather. DeNier in God's Garden doesn't do any good for God's garden as he is a movie-star, actor, singer and movie-producer.  DeNiere has not been the best actor here. He's gone over-the-top in this movie as a love-struck teenager or as an alcoholic. As in his first God's world he's been a loving father. The film would've been better served with him in a movie about his life as an old man. He looks more like he's a young boy on his way to college. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think if someone would tell me the premise, I would have laughed hysterically. The movie was simply an awful, awful piece of junk, at least from what I saw in it. I don't see how it would be worth to rent it to rent if you see it on DVD or buy it, there was no redeeming value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the TV show. I thought the TV movie could be considered a comedy because of some of the jokes made in it, or even some of these "homicides" the murders are actually worse than the TV series. I have seen the TV comedy, and it only got a couple of times I know it's bad and they only get one in a lifetime, and I don't know what's worse, the TV or the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is my first time seeing it, which was a total dud, I was not expecting a great film or movie. I got a total rip-off of it. I am a die hard fan of the book and this movie. This is a dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't read any review yet, but the book is very funny and it's just a matter of getting the movie out there in the form of a movie that is not the work of a professional movie writer, who wrote the book. The movie is the work that of a person who was a writer for a short time back in 1972 at the beginning of the 70's (that is, about 4 years before the "Star Trek" series was even produced), with the exception of the fact that it is shot on film and thus does not have the quality of a film. You can see it for yourself, when you watch the end credits. If you are not an avid "Star Wars" fan, I think you have to wait for the DVD and buy it (I have one on order) or rent it on video (i.e., I know why it came out on VHS). There are some very good fan-made "Starlogs" films. In fact, the "The Making of Star Wars" and "The Art of 'Star Wars'" films were made by the same director who directed this film, and I will not take the time to talk about them, either.  The original "Star Fleet" had its fans as well, the original "X-wing" series of games had fan films, and you will find the original film series on video or VHS somewhere. This is a very serious, serious, tragic, but very little fun movie.  I think this is one of those films that should be given a serious review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the movie at the film festival in Montreal (May 22-28) and getting involved in it, I can safely say it is a documentary and not a movie.  For me this was a movie with a lot of questions - mainly why they had to make this movie, who was in the position to be a participant. A documentary can address the question about what was really going on in this part of the world.  The documentary was the one thing that could have addressed this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As I've already stated, there is nothing original about this movie.  The movie starts with a really intense scene in the bathroom, where we get to see the two young people (Michael Jai White and Catherine Zeta Jones) going up to their grandmother (Dianna O'Shea) on the toilet and it goes from there.  I'm not surprised that the movie went from first prize in the festival to a second one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was all too easy for me to forget about my role as a teenager. It was so easy for someone who played a very similar role to me in middle school to copy me. (This one isn't so easy to remember.) And it's too bad for me as a movie star. The kid in middle was one of my best actors in a kid movie, while the kid in high school was one my funniest in a high school movie (he has the best story, or "family movie," for kids in middle age) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can honestly say that I have never watched any of the previous 90 minute or so films that had been done in the years previous to this one. I cannot imagine what it was like for the director or whoever was doing it to begin with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it comes to a plot, and judging by this movie, it has no plot. I had an idea of this movie being a movie with some sort of story, or some sort film that I could make a movie about, a film of my name. My name was used on this movie at the beginning of the movie, as one of the leads in the movie.  It is a sad excuse for a movie. I would really recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a movie that has a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As I was watching the movie, I thought that this would be a film that had some sort of religious theme, just like every other film I've ever seen, because it was the 20th Century version of the "God's Plan".  We All Know That The 20th century version Of The Plan Was, "The Rapture" Or "The Second Coming". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my fourth or fifth film, so I'm used to that, and it's been good at that (I won't mention any of the good films of the 70s)  This has been made for a major studio, so it has to carry the weight of the major Hollywood studios, and they (the major studios) have the ultimate responsibility. In the opinion of some (I'm not one of them), this movie does have a very interesting plot, and some very important characters (the director is very much able to make a very good "B" film out of such characters in the past), and the way the director's made up this character is butbutbutbut (it does not go so far as to do what the major studios seem to want). And what's really bothering me is that this character isn't very likable. I think he has been given some very interesting reasons to think he's very cold-blooded and evil, and I think they should make this character much like he's been made up before, and to keep this character as "B", I think this is a character that, in a major movie, could be given a proper, complete, complete make-up. I'll get back to this in a second. I've just been watching a number of other movies of this era (both from major and independent producers) where this character has been "B". "B"'s a very serious, serious, very serious character. This character has had his character made up for several different types of movie, and is the same in all of them, which is why I would like to see him given a make-over like many other characters in other films, not a makeover of any type. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first half of the movie, we are introduced to the good-looking and innocent-looking James Garner. We see the great performance he gave in the "Deathtrap" miniseries, and the miniserie he was in, and I thought that would be enough to get him a role in this movie. We have seen some of the other people who have played James Garner before, and it seems that they are a fan of his acting, and would like him to do the same here, and maybe he has something to say for his own part here.  In this, he has been demoted to the position of the "good cop", which means that he's supposed to be a real "law and order" type of cop, not a real law enforcement type of detective, and this film is still being edited and filmed, and there is no script that tells us what James Garner is supposed to do, or where he's going in this, and is a complete waste of $10 at the very end, and about $5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the worst films in history. It was a real disappointment that I had ever seen this movie. I was really disappointed. There wasn't a good reason to see it, even for a laugh. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's going to be bad for most of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was filmed in New Jersey, the same state the movie "Last Train" was made.   That movie is the true crime movie, this movie was made in the state of New York. It was a New York based movie, and New York-based actors.  New York City actors are in the movie as extras, and are being paid for their appearance. New York actors were the ones that got "shocked" on their subway.  In the late 90s, when actors were "reformed," they went back into the studios and got paid a lot more. As they were doing "last train," we just saw them getting a 10 figure paycheck for their performance in the "last year of movies." They didn't get paid so much for their participation in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a point in making this movie to discuss the movie's effects in a documentary and what effect those effects have in the real world. I will also mention that this movie doesn't just cover the effects of space flight and includes everything, including the effects on humans. As of today, I can't say I have even the slightest idea what the movie is about or what I am seeing on screen, not to mention that the cast is just a few guys in black tuxed up to play an entire, very thin group of characters with no real depth to them. All the acting on display in this movie is terrible. There is not a single scene that could be considered entertaining or even remotely believable. To say that it's simply a "tired" movie would be a huge understatement. I could tell, when I saw it at the theater, that I was supposed to like this movie and that it is an "old film" or that it was just too far into production.  I was surprised to read some people's comments and say that there are still some of my friends who think that this is a pretty good movie. It's even one of my favorites and one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I'm not just going to go watch it, I have an appointment set up at a movie theatre on Friday afternoon. The entire premise, from the beginning, is that it will be about a guy (I.e. a story that is told in a very bad way) and to have it even released before a whole movie is on the shelves, let alone a half hour before it's released, is a complete waste of my time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dawn" is the "film" to my knowledge; I can't help but wonder if the "Dewey-Travers" approach was more effective or if this is a good film for the public, I'm sure it would have been a different story entirely (with Dawn and Nick's characters in the same movie). We just found out on Friday that they shot this film as we were getting off the plane from London to the U.K., which was only a week ago! And we had to sit down and see this first hand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen and heard people talk about this movie since its release. I've spent the last 30 days or so talking to people who saw it and who were more qualified to talk about the film then me. This was another story about the same story told from a different person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I have seen this movie twice in the theaters. I do not recall being told the title before I rented this movie... I rented it to see what I thought might be a pretty good comedy about the end of WWII. This is a total waste of your time, a total mess that was completely horrible... "I don't remember the title of this movie for sure, so this may be a movie that's so bad that it was made because it's so unbelievable. You don't get a proper ending, so it wasn't very good at all, and it's all the time worse than the terrible ending that you get in the movie "E.T. for you" because you get so mad at this movie. Don't be fooled by this movie, I didn't expect a very good ending. I wanted a really good movie with a nice ending of all the movies that are out there, with people falling in love... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know much about this movie beforehand, it was only released in 1990. It's a surprise to me that it is still being made! I am really confused about the movie. I have seen the documentary on this subject and am very familiar with the subject matter of the movie and am not used to watching the film.  This movie has only one director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd heard people talk about how this was going to be a low-budget film and they'd be right. After seeing this film, I don't see how it could be classified as a low budget film. The cost of production of this movie is, as far as I know, at least four or five times what it cost to produce the original, and it has to be the same. What we have here is a film that is very poorly acted, badly directed, and has to deal with a score of actors who were all in it for the love of the role. A film of this sort could only be made by someone who really cared about the characters in the movie, and I'd hate to think of it as a movie of which I'd find myself enjoying a second time, and the film is not the slightest bit entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is more like an hour-and-a-half long piece. And it is a piece of art that should be entertaining, not tedious or worse, like a Hollywood film.  This piece of garbage is bad art, bad actors, bad dialogue, terrible performances, bad acting, bad music, poor direction, and worse movies than crap, and if you are stupid enough to see this movie, you will pay for that stupidity, so if you buy this, please, don't waste your money. I would highly recommend that you rent it again after a while and see if it was worth the money, if you enjoy this piece of junk, you won't enjoy it, and it is the worst piece of trash that ever was made. It's a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, my friends and I were having fun watching this movie, so we figured there was no chance of this being a complete waste of time. So, we were pretty lucky with the cast and the timing of it, as it was a Friday night and so we were on campus. In the grand scheme of things, the movie is basically a sequel to the original (and this is how it has been released) to the 1997 cult classic, and so there will have to be the same cast members and the same people in it, along with the same script and just that much time and effort put into itbut we will be getting it out at some point. It will probably be the first film to appear on DVD since this one came out on Video, and that is the way the plot for this sequel was supposed to go. I'll admit, I'm not an expert on cult films (I've been doing this since 1989 and have a hard time being good at this), so I do believe this could have been a great cult movie that had been the same person playing both roles again.   I think this movie is about a decade or so older than the first. This is all due to the fact that some of the original members were still alive and the original producers still had some of them on hand at the time of the 1997 release of The Lost.  Of course, the 1997 film was really about a couple of guys who were 20, and there was some overlap of material from that point as well, so perhaps it was just too late to release that.  In any event, the main actor who plays Max is Mark Pellegrini, the same actor who played him in the 1997 version. In 1997, Pellegrin was a big star for cult films, so it is a bit weird for the audience to see him playing Max in a movie about a guy with his age (it's hard to believe, really).  This is the film that had a more prominent cast and was being released on DVD back then. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a very bad joke. The characters are annoying and stupid, the plot is stupid and boring, the dialog is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe how this movie got made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those "realistic" Hollywood movies, so I will try to imagine the movie is for those that are trying to make movies like The Notebook.  If you watch this movie, you might be able to understand why I have never heard anyone rave about this movie (unless you are a big fan of the show). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of movies in my time. I've also seen more funny or more insightful movies. This is by far the most boring movie I've ever seen. It's really bad and awful, and I'm embarrassed for these actors who have had this role in my movie before, because the movie itself is very low-budget and horrible. I mean, I really don't know how they did it in 'Gloria'. It was very low budget because they made this movie. They are not a good guy's movie. It was just another movie about a horrible man who is an idiot, who has no redeeming value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw the movie it was on a black and white VHS cover that I would have guessed it to be somewhere in the vicinity of two hours and forty minutes. After seeing it's really not very good, it doesn't make sense and it's not so bad as to be not worth seeing or to be "worth the rental" if you ask me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find it hard to see who the director is or who he wants to be. I found the movie a little boring. The director is a real talent and has to direct a lot of movies that are like this one. I'm sure there was a point in this movie where we are all expected to "feel" for the character. I'd give you a movie on his hands, that's what I thought.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a guy named Jack (I think) who gets his job as a police officer by chance, who is sent out on a call in the middle of the night.  I can't seem to wrap my head around this movie, it could be my imagination, and I'm not about to sit through a minute of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen it from the 'original release' in 1973, it was a great movie with great music. It was the soundtrack to the 'Rocky Horror Picture', which is on DVD. And my personal guess is that this would be the soundtrack for a 'Rock 'n' roll version of the 'ROCK AND ROLL' film, which is the 'REVENGE OF THE BEGINNING' of the 1973 movie, which has all but vanished from the scene, along with the only thing resembling the 1971 version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion of this movie is pretty much like everyone else's. I like the concept of the film, so I am glad to have found it on the site. It's not that hard to find, I just didn't find it easy to comprehend. This isn't an isolated case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been said in the last review that I think people should see it and if they really like it, then that's what they'll be looking for. I'm going to ask the viewer, are you the type of person that is willing to watch this movie and spend the time necessary to see it through? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if they were really bad at this film or they were just bad, but I feel that it was more than just the script. I feel for the actors that are not from New Jersey or New York, they need to know that people are angry and upset, just like how I know it is with mine and my husband's friends and family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens with a girl named Ruby who is being held at a local school and she gets raped in this movie. There are plenty of other rape and murder movies that were released in the 80's and 90's. I think this one is very poor, although it could be worse. As a matter of fact, it looks like a real horror movie, although maybe a lot of my other movie-watching friends have seen this movie, which I think is on the video for sale at the local video store. I do not recommend this movie for anyone. If it is your only time or if you're really bored and/or if you want to watch it for the sake of entertainment, this is a good movie to see. The ending of the movie is very disturbing and the sex scenes are very good in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I was a believer in the power of art and poetry. When I was first exposed to film as a kid, I loved watching movies with words (WOW! there are thousands of them and so are thousands still around and in print!). I was in grad school when the first big-budget film was made and I went to film school and watched it with my classmates, I still went to class every day and I liked it.  I still loved watching "Citizen Kane" and so did the students I taught who were the film's subjects. "Clueless Guy" is not even close to a documentary or even close a full-length feature. There is not one piece of music worth listening to. There are bad actors, bad directing, bad cinematography, bad editing, bad writing. I think they're trying to imitate the documentary they tried to do on the subject of the film, which is really pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My personal opinion is that this is a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason for this movie is because of a movie called "The Dreamers" which is a documentary film.  A documentary is supposed to tell the truth, what's happening in the Dreamers' film makes for a very hard-to-believe documentary.  I don't even know how this documentary got made, and I don,t know how I could ever give this movie the name "The Story Of Dreamers". That's all I could think of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw it, as well as the film, and it was very hard to take my eyes off the screen.  If you want to be honest, I would recommend watching it without me around. I do believe the film has a certain purpose, and I wanted to see how the characters were portrayed and developed, and if it was a realistic drama about someone trying to move up in life, and trying to rise in the sport, it could be a good film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's difficult to say which one of these things is a new movie, and who knows if it ever will exist.  I'm afraid to say that I'm about to watch it, so you know what I'm saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's pretty well done in the idea of being a "documentary" but the film doesn't seem to be able to find any connection with the characters. The people are really mean and I think they're all pretty terrible people. They really do need to be a bunch of losers and have a stupid love for themselves. I don't think I'd like to see the film, I would rather watch a whole bunch of the guys' lives. What is there any connection at all? I find this movie very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not your average "movie". And that's a good thing because it will hopefully bring in some sort of critical review. I think I'll just make the observation that I've seen some "film-house" films (as in "Filmhouse" meaning "film"): some of the movie-houses have never seen a movie that was half this length, and this is one of the shorter films in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is made up of interviews and a few short films, which are supposed to be "scripted", and the interviews are mostly taken from the movie I was in the movie, i.e. the interviews in the film were all in English, and they were on the phone with the director.  I don't know what they were doing to the people in the interviews, and most of the interviews that I've done on the internet are really well done, so i'm glad they're being taken into account, though the people who interviewed in the video were probably pretty good too. i really can't blame them for doing a really good job and showing my character, though there are probably a few people in there who had nothing in common with them, i have a hard time finding a link between any of the "interviewees" and the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was originally released on videotape in the UK and I believe is still in use. Some reviewers have pointed out the similarity between the two, which would be the "same director", the reason for the DVD release is to prevent the film from being a self glorification of its director and cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I am not one of those who believe in the power of the gods, so I was trying to imagine how much it could change someone's life, I have to say that if it was to be as entertaining as it was in the beginning, I'm guessing that you have it all.  I have seen every episode of the first season, and enjoyed them immensely. I have always, for many years, looked forward to this series.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutalthough I am about two thirds of the way through the first episode, I still haven't really gotten a look at the first movie, and although I'm sure that I'll be able to watch it in the next few days, I donbut feel like I should wait. That's not to say I'm going to watch this movie and not watch it at all, Ibut I don't know what they were thinking when they made it, because it really doesn't seem that they were serious about the project. There are things that should be taken seriously. One of the most important parts of this movie is to keep the secrets about the "special" group of people who were in there before, and about the actual nature of the powers that this movie will be offering, which in my opinion, is absolutely crucial to the success of this project. They had a plan for the movie to be really serious, and with a great cast and director and I donI see no reason for this.  In any case, I was so looking forward to watching it and to be able review it for other people. I hope you all have a wonderful viewing, and please let me know. I can't wait!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To make matters worse, the first time I watched this movie, my husband was with me and I was very upset at the end of the movie with him. I mean, what if his friend was also in the theater? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why they would give a "B" rating, because this movie is really just a bunch of people on stage. And if you are really lucky, you might get lucky and actually have an actor playing a part of the part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not an exaggeration to say that I had to watch a great deal of it... it was good that the director knew what he was doing, since he could use that knowledge to create a sort of "mini-series", since it would have been very weird for the series to have been created with the help of a great number of writers and actors from all the writers, and for those who were familiar with the book would have seen that this was "a small movie". There were no good actors. In the beginning I thought that "this would be a series of short stories" and maybe some kind of a low budget, so to see it at a theater in the very last minute, or during the very early stages, it just took the best of good taste and "film people" to understand that "the movie is a film" (whatever that may be), and it's the same as it was for a very poor (and I mean, poor) one, and a few "funny" things, such as a couple lines of the film with a woman that look like they were improvised on their parts by a director who had never before been involved in film.  The only good thing that I can find in the film is that it has the excellent "theatrical trailer" that's available on the DVD, which shows a lot of nudity and such, since the trailer has been done for previous films, so maybe that's a good film (or rather, that's what the trailer is used for). I think the reason it's been in cinemas is mainly because the film had already been released in theaters, and it would be kind of pointless to make the same trailer for the film, as well as the same actress and actors perform the film. We'd be at the mercy of the production team... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very interested to see how this would compare to some of the other "B" films, and would have found this film interesting. It was a "B"-movie made in the 1990s, so I would have been more likely to see some of those older films.  I do not consider myself a serious film critic, so don't take the last movie's "film noir" remark personally.

We are talking about a movie that has been out for five years now...and so if you have seen it, you will know what we are talking here about now...it's about an hour-long movie, and that is really disappointing. You have to see it in order to appreciate the greatness of this moviebut it really just gets you on a plane and brings you home.  I wish this movie was better and had all the actors I felt comfortable in front of.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the first few minutes of this movie I thought it was a documentary about the last 40 years of the lives of the guys, just like with any documentary there are always those who want to tell the story of the movie and the first five minutes is still on the shelf, so it is possible to rent. I am surprised at how bad this movie is! It's not even a comedy!  The actors were terrible and the movie was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the movie was going to be a "thriller" and just one more film to be released in the summer. I would have been surprised to see any of the actors go through what they did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a great time in that I really liked the cast in the first film. So, in the second one, I did enjoy the characters and the but it was not the greatest of all time and there were a few scenes that were just ridiculous and the worst of them were at the beach where two actors played some weird and totally unrealistic version of a lifeguard. They were in swim trunks, they were in little flip-flops. They got in the lifeguard's car, a couple of the kids got in it, the life guard got in and he opened the door to take out a life preserver and they went into the beach and got into the car. The life guard gets out of the car and is about to open the door of the beach house.  My wife was just so appalled and upset about it that she told me how terrible that scene was. It was so ridiculous. This was a really terrible movie. I really think they should have stopped this movie on its third day. This movie was actually the best one I've seen for the life of me in the old Universal Studios. This one was completely awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard about this movie from the big screen (the TV show), and I had thought that I would just find out about this once or twice a year, and maybe a few episodes of the TV show. After reading the reviews, I'm sorry to say that it was the only movie made for the TV station, which I don't know if that was a good thing, it's a TV station so it can afford it's budget on this. I thought I would be able to take this film with the knowledge that I could still get my hands on a DVD copy (I was about to rent this at my local video store) and still have a few friends to watch it. I can say that I'm going to spend my hard earned money (about $40) on this movie. This is one movie that I wish to see as an end product. The director doesn't know when to tell the truth, when to do the right thing, what to expect, how to act, what type of person he wants to be associated with and he has a bad cast of actors, with the exception of two really funny young ones, who are both very talented and will play a small part in this movie, I'll give them credit for their acting ability, and that's why I felt they were on the show, in a different film, which will be shown later on and will take an hour or two to do a really funny comedy piece (a comedy like "Beetlejuice"). I wish for these people to be paid for their talents. I love the idea of "Stacking up the pay" (I love "Anchorman"), but they did an incredible job in a short amount of time on "Beeta" as the "Beete". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The end result was quite possibly the most exciting film ever made.butbutinstead, it was an extremely disappointing film and very, very few people seem to have the guts to take the risk of watching this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Girl" had some kind of mysticism, with a white rabbit, which was the primary character.  She's got the title "The Man," and I'm sure they didn't realize how serious she's taken with this project, which is "I Have a Problem With This Movie," which is why she's been shooting for about six hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to be so cynical. I guess I was so busy getting my work done during the movie. The only reason I went out was to see a show about a young girl with autism and her dad that was on TV when this show came out.  My hope is that the show is at least as good as this one is awful bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I watched the movie, I was entranced by the incredible script which was so entertaining. In this sequel, it seemed as if the writers got bored and bored with the concept and just couldn't handle the idea. At one point the hero (Tom) and his friend run into a group of men and their friend's friend, and they both jump in front of the vehicle and try to take a picture of the two.   I have had some wonderful experiences on set and on set with actors from all over the world. I have seen them make films with great chemistry and try their best to get the most of whatever it is they have to work with and try very hard to bring the film to life. I am no expert in writing and directing, so I don't want to comment on this film with any kind of expertise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw it, it was for my high school graduation.  I was a bit bored and didn't get all the gory parts, and that was the case because I liked it with the gimp guy, and I thought he looked like an old man in the original picture, and for the film, I'm looking at it like the first time, and as such the gimps are being played by the first two characters who were actually wearing them. I don't understand how it's a good idea to throw out the first 2 characters in the film for the sake of the film... They didn't do such a good job of looking silly for Halloween on their own... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it weren't for the fact that I'm a horror fan, I would say this is a low-budget horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have never seen the film before, you will not understand the point of this film, which is that it's not about any one particular group, in the sense that the other members of the band are not there to guide you through. In a perfect world, the film would be called "Biteback", as they all want to live in the same area and share their music. They are all musicians, not rock stars. The music is not as good as the new one, and that's because the band members of The Velvet Underground were in the film as well, singing. And that was all done on stage, in front of the audience at the time of their performances.  And that's an old version of the film, from 1947, with their old material. And then again, "The Velvet Underground" was a very different band at that time. It didn't do any concerts, and did not perform the exact same songs. It also didn't have the same drummer, in fact, and he had passed away by this time. I'll tell you this; if it was all about a reunion and reunion performance, they probably would have never done it; it was a reunion of sorts, because they needed help getting out of the house and out into the street with their fans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really know why, but I really don't believe that this movie would be good. It has a bad ending. I don to really understand why, and they should be apologizing, because it's like I was watching a comedy or a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of the TV show and, on the TV, "Gangland" looks like it was done in 1994 when it was about to be released and when I read this review, I thought, hey, a real Gangland film could look like this. I did some research and, yeah, this movie looks good. This is because some of the gangland movies (Gangster Disciples, Gangsters) looked like they were done in the 70s and 80s and the 70 and 80 years look like they are from today, so some of them have "new" locations. This was a new movie and I can't say I liked it. The lighting was poor. The acting was very bad. I felt like, in the gangster films, this was done by someone who didn't know what he was doing and that he'd been influenced by the good guys. I found it more like a film that would be shown on television. If you want to see a good movie about a great film, watch the movie "Gangs of New York" and watch "Grim Reaper" (the first film) on television, "Rise of the Dragon" was a great movie. If anything, that movie was inspired by this movie. It was a good film, and I just had to see it again.  I give it a 10 or a 9 on the IMDb rating. I rate it 8.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started out at an unknown studio and was made under the premise of it being "the best film ever made". As the credits rolled I was so stunned.  To say it, it was bad.    It is obvious from the movie that the director really put some time into this film and that he was trying to make this film into something it should've been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just bad. I really felt like I was watching a bad B-movie. I think the movie was better when the other guys were talking, because they're really good actors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was the one who had it released on DVD. So, I'm gonna assume that if you have a DVD, you can see the movie at its peak, in the dark. It's the DVD that was "cured," and then released to the general public. In any event, there is an almost unbelievable plot that goes on forever. It is not possible for the human mind to comprehend. It seems to me that if it were possible, the filmmakers would not even try to make it more entertaining, or funny. I find myself agreeing with the many comments of people who have seen this film, that the "man in the house" would be laughing at it. There is not even the slightest bit of subtle humor or subtle irony. And if you read the "review" of this film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not even kidding. There was a woman at a party who, by some miracle, was given a copy of this movie and was allowed to rent it. She rented it and went and rented this movie. It was a horror film at that time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why I'm even writing this review is because of the DVD's (the movie was on DVD in the UK). That's not the only reason I'd like to see a movie out there, it was the first time the actors were in this industry, which was in their late 20s, they were in their early 30's at the time of the movie. As to why I'd see this film was because of "the people who are in the business" (I know, I'm a writer). The reason I'm writing this is because this film isn't being put out to be a comedy, or it's being put into the public domain to be "mockery", or a mock "drama" (to borrow from a movie called 'Troll 2', which was a comedy with an absurd plot). The plot in this film is very poor. I don't think that this movie could ever be a successful comedy or an "A-level" comedy. It is a film you have to see for itself to see the actual quality of it. If you watch it with friends, you probably won't enjoy it (I would just say that for the sake of comedy). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The original series was on the Syfy network and the last "Space Shuttle", they just flew to space. This time around, we have to wait until late afternoon to see the second episode, which could still be taped.  There's also an episode with the "Space Station" in it, which was just about to air. There was only one episode of "Shuttles" before the cancellation of the show (the very last one) because it was in reruns, and it didn't really do well on Syfy (although it did have the same "space station") so the only other two episodes of this season, "Pioneers" and "Walking With the Astronauts", are of the actual Space Shuttle. That's the "space shuttle" which, for the rest of us, has made several more appearances than the "toy" version of the shuttle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not good at all. It's just like a bad dream. I would recommend watching this movie for entertainment purposes alone. Don't waste your time and money. This movie, unfortunately, is worth watching for comedy purposes. It is worth seeing the comedy. I had a very hard time finding the funniest line in the movie, let alone the "jokes." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a horrible movie. The movie is about to be released by "Warners". The movie itself is about a horror-comedy.  I can say that I'm familiar with the world of "horror-comics". As soon as a movie tries to do horror movies, I can't tell if it's a man or woman or whatever, it makes people laugh. They have such a huge budget for this movie, why didn't they give it a serious look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did like the film because it was about the relationship of a boy and girl. A boy and boy, or some of the other film makers.  There was some connection of it was my second film (ROCKY MONKEY) with THE BLUE MAN and THE BLOODY MAN. I think I know that. And since the last time we had seen ROCKY MONK, we'd all gotten to know each other and been friends with each other for over 30 years... I was sure he would be willing to play the part of a man... I think he's been asked about it. We don't know his feelings about that... He just didn't seem at ease in his role. We are talking about a small movie that has only one or two leads... we had to watch this for the first time last Friday evening when we had lunch at the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For those who like the original, there are spoilers here.  For all other moviegoers, it is probably best to read the book. The other movie features a woman and a man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's too hard to sit down and too long to get to the end. I'm not an idiot, I understand that movie-making techniques have changed since the 60's when the only other film that I've ever seen that was this long was "WEST SIDE STORY". "WESTERN WEST" is probably my third best movie.  The other two have a lot more time to prepare, and that's the only thing that the new film was good at in my opinion. The guy who made "Wes" had to sit alone in a cabin at night to get ready to make this one.  If this is one of the greatest western movies ever made, why did you decide to make a movie like this one?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As for the DVD I was given this I was promised a decent ending of my life's work and that is what the DVD offers me.  I would say to watch this movie from any angle, with any form of comedy, any form, for that matter, just so you know exactly what's in your mind, just to get to know who I was and what I was, and so far, I've only seen it on TV and I don't believe it's made any kind of money and I would really like for this movie to actually have a decent budget. I'm still pretty sure if the film had any sort of budget, it would be a comedy of a different genre, and it really shouldn't have the time and effort to be made into a comedy about the real world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how this movie could possibly reach the same level of quality of "The Dictator," let alone "The Ten Commandments," when "The Last Temptation of Christ" is still my number one, for my personal satisfaction and to keep this movie from becoming a rip-off, it needs to be as good as "The Testament of Moses" or at least as good if not better, and it has never been released in video, so there are no "previews" or anything like that that we have of it in book form. The director is currently in the process of putting together a new film to get this movie to the stage that this one needs to reach. I'll keep you all posted! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a terrible effort at both the writing and the directing. It is unbelievable that this movie could possibly succeed, it is even worse than the worst movie of "The Day After Tomorrow". I am shocked. The only reason why the director had the faith in this movie to write it and direct it, is because this movie is like a remake of "Day After Tomorrow"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an "art film".  I have seen a few of the movies with the real actors. I have also seen some movies with real actors, the usual suspects who will always be the real stars of the films. This is "realism". This movie is "art". I did enjoy reading books like "The Art of the Paperback Book" (which was, as I recall, another art film) and the story behind that. This movie has nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What was the movie was a "classic" horror film, was a horror film with a horror premise.  It has two of the three horror actors who have done horror films together and the only one who has done the film in the past, Jack Cassidy. The other two are of different age and don't know each other's "street stories". The older actor doesn't know Jack Cassidy's story, which is an interesting thing that happens when you don't do a movie that's about the characters of "The Ring" with Jack Cassidy, but this is the "classic horror" film from the 80's that has to do with murder, rape, and the supernatural. This time, the young actor goes with the script from a friend and his friend's friend. The old one, his character isn't the one Jack Cassidy plays in the classic horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find it strange that the movie goes so far as to include two of my friends in it. They both live in Chicago and they have not yet written a negative critique about this movie. We don't know what sort of role she was meant to play. We haven't seen a single scene from her that I have found to be worthy of a second viewing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens with a lot of enthusiasm. "Mysterious" is an actual mystery, not an obscure film, and it's about a mystery that isn't so mystery itself. "Strange" is a film with an ambiguous plot (the mysterious man's name is always mentioned in reference to "the stranger").  There are numerous instances of "bad movie theater" - I love "bad movies", especially the old ones that came out before DVD players. "The Strange" isn't scary. It's just confusing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had some success with this one in the movie theater because the director did not do his own voice work and did not speak out loud in the theater with an American accent. I have not had an opportunity to read the novel, and so I cannot comment on any aspects of the novel. I am also quite certain that the director will not be able to understand much of what you are saying at any moment during the film. This film is very difficult to understand, particularly if the subject matter is difficult to relate to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the type to be an actor, but for a comedy, that's a whole different ball game. The "original" version was a very good comedy with a lot of laughs and moments in the film. If you're not familiar with the original version, it was very funny. They brought back many of the old "Bubba" voices and brought in new ones. I'm surprised that I actually know more people who don't know the original film than those who do, and there were still some very good people in the cast. The writer and director of the original is John Carradine, who was an extremely brilliant writer. He had the idea for a really good movie, one which I loved and which was released on the VHS format in the U.S. as "A Christmas Story".  As for the cast, I have been around for "the Bus" and have been in many films and can honestly say that most of them are fine. They're pretty well-known and, for the most part, haven't done any bad work, either.  So far, they've just been too old. I guess there are a lot more talented people in their 20's and 30's than those of us who were 30 when the original was released, and these actors are the same age. I would never say that they're less talented because the new generation of actors has been around in this business for almost 15 years or so. I can imagine that the younger group's audition videos, as well as their films, were also very good (the Bus was about 30 years old when I wrote and directed it). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you ask me, what the ultimate point of this movie is, I think that this movie has nothing to do with what we are trying to accomplish here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a good screening of "Granada" in 2003, the director has his "G" cut in a day. He claims the film's a comedy and that he has to look at it at film festivals. Actually, his "film" isn't funny and is just a collection of recycled clichés, and the whole movie has to make a point!  The film is too long, too dumb and dumb and bad at all the points, and it is hard to get into the movie. To quote a reviewer here: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I have ever written about a movie so I thought this might be a review of a film, and I was very excited for the review on the website (see this website for "reviews" and movies from a number of different directors and actors) to be able to read reviews from people I have never heard of.  After reading this movie is a pretty poor work of art. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of Mr. DeNiro and have watched a lot of his movies. The reason this is a "DeNiro movie" is because of the way it is marketed. This movie was very poorly put together, very predictable, badly directed, and the dialogue is just unbelievable. The movie ends with a very lame scene with a completely ridiculous scene at the end where DeNair runs home. And a good scene from "Good Will Hunting" has DeNoree chasing the truck with DeNario's head on fire. There was no real sense of what happened in this, and nothing makes sense. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, even if you have to watch it on TV. It was a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw the movie this afternoon, and my jaw was dropping at the awful acting in the movie, and terrible timing of when the movie comes out. I'm shocked to see how the movie was in the theatres. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is about a "new guy who is taking on an old guy." He has a new buddy named "The Big Guy," who is a "bad guy." If you liked "Little Man Who Loved" then you will understand the story.  I really wanted to be able to write about this movie because of the fantastic premise and story. I found myself looking for the words "the story" in the comments from people, as this movie was filmed. I didn't get the opportunity to sit down and really think about the story, which makes me feel like I wasted an hour of my life. The movie doesn't make up for the great premise, not only with what it doesn't have, but it's got a "big guy" as a "little man" at the end, which is a bad guy who has a stupid and stupid idea about how the world works and how a bad character should act. It doesn't help that the story is made in a bad timeframe. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must confess, after I saw the original version of this movie back in the late 1990's, I really loved it.   In my humble opinion, it is the best horror film ever made. But for some reason, it still had the same director, who is a man who I've known since he made the original movie. I'm not exactly sure why, but he must've been busy somewhere.  I'll be honest, he didn't really look like a horror director, so that's why I gave him an 11 out of 10, because I didn't realize just how important this role was in this movie, because he was the wrong guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "A" cast is in it's third installment, and it was supposed to be this film's "A-cast" at the end of this film, so I thought I would give this one a try and see what might happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie at a flea market in NYC. It has a small budget compared to some other movies and it is very hard to find a place to rent this movie in NYC, and I'm not sure why.  The movie starts with a flashback about "a big city" and goes straight to NYC, which is not exactly true to what the movie tells about NYC. The movie is about "Little America", "Little Italy" and "Little Germany".  I really can't find that Little America is really little and Little Italy is not really little either, and the movie makes a point of showing us little Americans.   For all of these little Americans to act this little, with no real acting education, just really stupid, I think I'd give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't want to be a reviewer about movies, but since I don't know how to go about this movie, the only way I can describe it is "I really don' know what to do". It might be better to have a really good script (like I was in "Frost") and I really hope that it comes up for me to look for.  I know that there are people working on this movie (on IMDb), and I hope to find out that I'm not the only one affected by this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was in the film theater when this happened, and a lot of the people there were laughing about it (and I was, not laughing at this). I really thought that I would see the movie in my local community, which is near Seattle, where I had just finished college, and see how people would react to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to be brutally honest about this film, even though I've seen it with my own eyes on tape, or watched it for several hours on a video tape.  The reason why I'm so blunt with this is because they're so poor in the script, they do not have any chemistry, nor do they know how to do it. They're bad actors, the worst thing about this movie is that the two leads have even had sex, and they're both so incredibly awful. The girls are just not in the least bit cute or cute, and it's so obvious, that the director, who is only in it because of how many people have fallen for it, has been able to find happiness in making movies with beautiful people. In real life, they're more than unattractive. The whole concept of what the girls do, with any excuse, is wrong. If you look in the mirror and are not in a porno, you're not going to find a decent person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm trying to watch this movie for a year or more. When the credits were up I had a feeling that I'd never be able to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a man, or woman, or gay couple, or straight couple would be about one man and one woman, in that case it would be a straight film. A movie like this should be called "a movie about something." If you like anything that is gay or lesbian then you'll probably enjoy itbut if you don't you might not like it. The movie starts out as a rather good comedy with some great supporting performances, with some of the characters you'd find in a comedy about love, with Adam Sandler and Robert Downey Jr. They are good people. Adam Sanderson does a great job as a stand up comedian. His acting is solid and the but there is one scene in the movie that I'll leave you to discuss. In the movie, a couple of minutes before the credits, Adam Sandberg is in a saucy nightclub scene.  I didn't find out why he didn't do it, but when he's in the saucylube he's the star attraction, that's the scene that starts in the video.  The scene was really offensive, very vulgar and pornographic. There is some nudity in the scene where Adam Sandberger is with his friend in the bathroom, with an naked woman, and there's nothing in this scene that is really inappropriate, or that you should be offended by. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My only good review was the end of this movie, which was very depressing in that movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised at how much of a difference in quality between the two, in the first two episodes.  There was only a little bit of "wish me luck" in the second episode.  And in the third episode, I actually went back to the first episode and rewatched it... And this episode is "Wish you luck". It's very bad... If you don't mind watching this episode at your local library. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was going to be just a couple of people who didn't have anything else to do...like a couple days off...or something. I like to read, I love to write, thisbut it's a bad one, that's all I'm going to say for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the chance to watch this with my daughter on the other side of the country. It was also on the Sci Fi channel in the UK. We have to keep up with Sci Fi, I can't keep up anymore with SciFi channels. When I'm finished with this, it will probably get re-edited into a decent Sci Fi film, like this is supposed to be.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about one day when the protagonist gets bored, goes to a movie theater, and watches a movie at the "backyard" of the theater and plays with various "artists". I'm not even sure whether there's even a movie here because if there is, I'd rather watch a really boring film, even on television, that might be shown in a movie channel somewhere. And to me, "art" means something that can be understood. I'm sure that there are people who are good at visual art, and I guess there are also people who can tell the difference between good movies and bad movies, because it isn't that it's good to be "artistic" or good to do "art", or that it is bad, and there are still people who try to make it look like something it isn'y. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is about the relationship of a group of people who are friends and then at the end of the movie, the director decided to create an alternative universe for a film called "The Way of the Masters" (another film of the same title) and has taken away from this true story that I felt would have been more of a film on the screen of the stage. "Masters" is supposed to have its own unique storyline, as it would have in the film "The Master of Masters" which is a film that was so great and well made. The movie "M" was the only one that was truly a perfect blend of drama and humor that the movie "the Way of Masters". The only thing that makes this movie a complete and satisfactory piece of work are the songs. As I listened to "M Masters", I felt that they were butbutbutthat are now missing, and it seemed as if the director and I had parted company at the beginning of the film, at least according to the original cast-members. The way things are set up now in the movie is so inconsistent, that it's not funny at all. "The way of the masters" has its own plot, and there is no way for a true "master to die" and for the movie to be "The master's way of life" either. This is the movie that should have been made for the stage, not the movie in which I spent almost 5 hours of my life watching. I would encourage people to stay away from the movie and rent it and pay a movie or show what it is really supposed to be about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to guess that I was not the only person in this movie who had this "con" experience. I don't really care who is more wrong. The movie is supposed to be about a person's transformation (not the guy going in the lake). I couldn't find the transition, couldn't see how the guy was going to turn into his "tough guy" self. It's really awful, and really makes you question what the hell is going on with this movie, and why it was made. And this is for something that was supposed to really help him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first film with a real ending. This is another one. It has a real plot,but it is very far down the list of "good". I really don't recommend this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to this movie being about the "old school" or something similar. I am a sucker for "real" movies, as I will admit, and in any case I'm not a kid and certainly have never played the game myself, nor do I play this stupid game called "Tyson". I find it disgusting, horrible, and totally unbelievable that the makers of this movie ever even considered allowing anyone of us to own or rent this movie, and that is a sad feeling indeed. Tyson was absolutely terrible on the field, and I am not exaggerating here. He is a pathetic man. It's impossible for you to see him as an athlete and be proud of that.  The only reason Tyson wins in the boxing ring, he is that the guy is the only one with his back to the camera, and as you may be aware, the more you lose, the angrier he gets.  He is truly a disgrace to himself, and he should never have been in the cage with us. He's absolutely worthless. I had to rent it in a few parts of the city, and if I would have paid to see this movie the first time around, I would never have bothered to rent or rent again, and, at the very least, I'm embarrassed for my country and to Tyson's fans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen some films that were more politically oriented and more serious, I have certainly seen some political films before. In some of these films the political content is very, very obvious, and in other cases there are plenty of political films like "The Godfather" that can be understood in the context of the historical events they are about. In this film I feel like I have to ask a lot of questions and understand a lot more in order to really figure out what is going on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the late nineties I rented this movie off of DVD and I have seen it on video in the past. It is the most popular film of it's genre-- I rented it off of video and had no idea if it would be a B- or an A-rated film. I watched the first three "B" films-- they were the first in the series, and so I had the feeling of "this is going to be something like a B movie," so I have no idea how it ended up with "The Cat and the Mouse" or "Little Shop of Horrors." In fact, it appears that the production budget was only a hundred bucks, and it is clear that it is the film which has been made at the behest of the producer-- I am very sorry to see what my movie was like because I'm certain that it was well worth the money. (It has a great cast and many great actors). butbutbutBUTbutbutyet the rest of the film is made by the "Cat and Mouse" producers-- who apparently just went back to make another sequel because they are bored or perhaps just to re-make the first film for some reason... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a great movie with some great songs and great actors. Why does a movie just come out of a box?  It's not for a good movie, I'd say, for the next 5 minutes or so. And the guy with the voice of Jesus is really annoying (and that's no exaggeration, and it doesn't really seem like a person who's been good at acting for more than 15 years), too, and really doesn't have a convincing voice, too, not that it's the worst of anything (it's actually pretty good as far as being a guy who sounds like a man).  And then you have the guy who plays a good guy, the one who plays in the "Bible" movie and who plays the "God" character (and I don't really like that guy as Jesus). He had a pretty good voice. I'd probably like it to sound like his voice in the movie, and I think he has a pretty decent impression of Jesus and he has pretty good body language, I wouldn't say like that he's doing the voice as good as the guy in the Bible, since it's a bit wooden, and the lines are a bit vague and unsympathetic in that movie, especially in that part when he's in front of the mother.  Maybe that's the guy playing Jesus in the other "movie". He was probably good in that other movie and I really enjoyed watching him, I actually loved "The Last Temptation" and this is just bad, or at least very disappointing. "Mystery Men" is a great story about a good comedy with some good actors. The way it was done. A good director and a really funny movie could come up with something good. It could be a comedy where this one is made to be one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of David Lynch, and I just saw a David Lynch movie called DREAM ON, which is the second movie in the David Lynch trilogy.  DREAM was a great movie and so were the people involved with it. DREAM had a great soundtrack that was very memorable, but this movie is a total waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's because I watched it on the computer and not at a theater in Los Angeles. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen a lot of horror movies. Some of them are made with people in masks. Some are made like a horror film. This is the first ever movie with this particular type of creature (and I've seen more movies made by the makers of "Shrink It down", "Shake It Down", "Down", "Scare It Down" etc.) The reason for this movie is apparently because they have no idea what a good horror movie is and, since they are Hollywood movies and, therefore, think they can make it with great success, which is to be expected. I can say that while it is a great story and well executed, the actual genre of "horror" is not that great. It's the kind of movie where you watch a lot and enjoy it and where you know that you are going to be in a safe place and not be threatened by a bad monster, so that it won't go on a killing spree. I did get to see some scary little creature scenes when I was in San Francisco for the opening of "The Hills Have Eyes", "Rosemary's Baby" or "Poltergeist". The creature in the house, the thing that looks like a bat or some insect-type creature, looks almost as if it's wearing a hat and it does look like there's a mask and some kind of eyeglasses on it. It could have been a real scare. It wasn't creepy at all. It just wasn't scary at all, that's all. I think that there are no better examples of this kind of "gothic" horror (with black hair, white clothes, blue eyes) that are available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending scene was like the beginning scene--so I'm going to recommend you to watch this movie once--after you see the movie, because the movie is not very good--like I'm sure you want to see it anyway--there are no really good characters in it--so if you're gonna see it, and if you want the ending scene, then you're in for a very strange experience, in the movie--no spoilers, just my opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very close to becoming the headliner, not to mention being able to sit in the same theater for the movie.  I don't think it was meant to be that I would have been allowed to attend, to think of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is a real student of film-making and has been in the industry for over 40 years. His films have been in many languages throughout his career, which could have allowed him to make a film about the Holocaust or just the Jewish community in New York. I can understand why the New York Holocaust Museum is not giving back the film because he's been trying to contact some people in the community, who have made this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first few minutes were cute, if I got the DVD (i didn't see this) I would have been shocked that people would actually like it. It had to be so different. A different movie to see in a different theater or at different time (when people can really appreciate it). The story itself is pretty boring. I don't know who thought that a really small story would be the movie it would end up as, I don;t understand what happened there. I think it's really hard to see the whole thing and what I have had to watch is just a small part of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so predictable. I didn't care for a lot of the characters. This is a movie about a group of friends and family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the movie had come out in the early 1990s, it would have been very different. This movie came out in 1992. It was made for a syndicated television show and it was intended for a wide audience. The movie has all the ingredients of a poor, poorly made film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that they are trying to make an epic film. I believe that it was a little too late to find out what was going to happen to the project after the success of the film. The film was a real disappointment, with a weak plot and weak characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the kind to really watch other people's movies (for better or worse), but this is about the last movie in the "New Movie Series" - and I have to say that the production values here are extremely low - from the terrible (or at least not funny) dialog to the completely bad or worse-made film (the one I caught in my local theater) to the absolutely awful movie (as bad or bad-bad-bad) - I have never seen anything like this in my life, and that's on a very brief review, not one minute of my life worth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the most ridiculous of the bunch and it's not even a comedy. I've got no idea how to write this review and I'm going to have to do it. Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of the original series. The original show ended when the gang got tired of living in San Francisco, they moved to the outskirts of town, got a job, got the gold suit, and so on.  In The Series, the gang travels through out the state of California in search of the gold.  I've never liked the series because it seems like they were supposed to follow the original show through to the end. Why not just do the series. I don't think this is the movie for kids, although it might be great for kids.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was one of the most interesting and thought provoking pictures I have ever seen in a while, especially with a story about reincarnation, reincarnation and the "good" end of people having been bad and vice versa (good vs. bad).butbutbutBUTbutbutyet it wasbutbecause a lot of it was shot with actors who went to film the aforementioned movie and a lot more people, including manybutbutthough. Not only was the butbutbut because a lot people, especially those who were good, wanted to come to this film and they were told there was going to be a reunion, they were also asked to dress up and dressbutbut. I don't know if I've ever said this,but I am a person who's an avid movie watcher, and when Ibutbut, the but. I've just been told that these "good actors" weren't good enough to wear their good looks on top of their good clothes. Not because of the but butbutbecause they were too good for those bad looks. In fact the bad actors weren't even "bad" or anything like that, they just looked too "good". This was the kind of movie that should have been about good people acting bad (not "bad people acting good", which is the story). I just feel bad for the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just terrible... There is nothing I can do but wait for it to get released on video... I mean who would buy this, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself with a big grin on my face throughout the entire film,but because I was watching it and not actually playing it (and because it was too expensive for me to actually play the game)I was too happy with myself and that I was going to make it out to be what it was going. Now I have to admit, I did enjoy a lot of video game video games and a lot about the game industry. I was planning on spending the money I made from playing the game to pay for this one. I didn't see the point in doing it. It isn't the biggest RPG ever and doesn't try to emulate it; it isn't a bad video game. It wasn't bad in any way at all.but the lack of gameplay is why it was given a 7 out of 10 score. There's a whole lot more you can do in a game than just wander around and shoot things. As I mentioned in the game review, the camera in the beginning was completely static, which was due to the lack in a decent level of graphics. If you want a game that has just two characters, but one is armed and the other unarmed you can buy it. They shoot at each other. When the enemy gets near the camera, shoot the first guy, shoot a little more slowly than usual and it would be just that, static and in the distance. It was the same with the enemy's camera in your face every few minutes. I don't know how the camera moved around at all and was supposed to be able to follow my character. I had to spend about an hour trying to figure out the camera position. And while it's not that hard, I had the whole time thinking about what to do with it, what to shoot, what was the best way to hold the camera so it was all one line. And I didn' t find the same sort of interest from the game world as I did from the one in the movie. The first time around, the enemy was just a man, in a dungeon with a bunch of zombies and skeletons and that sort of thing. And of course this is a totally different kind of setting. It's a completely different kind, with a whole bunch of people that you don't have a clue about and some really dumb and stupid enemies that can be easily beaten with basic logic.  The story and characters were completely ridiculous. There are some really stupid things in it.  It doesn't make you think.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that much of an exaggeration.  The only good review about the movie is it being available for rental. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the first three of this. As far as being a fan of the film, which was very high, I really enjoyed the first film. I would really like to see that this is at least a half hour long movie, I do not know why it does not. I watched this film with an extremely small group of friends, and then at a nearby bar where they all watched it with me, and it was only really for entertainment purposes. My friends and I were pretty disappointed that the movie was made in Hollywood, and that is a film that has a very good chance of being really, really good, with all the talents of the director and a lot of really good actors. It's kind of a big deal to be cast in a truly top quality film, and the actors, both in front and behind the camera, should be able to carry the picture but we will have to wait until the end of the summer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, let me say that I am not a historian. Second, the fact that this film was a History Channel documentary. It is obvious to the viewer, that this movie is intended for kids, and that's it.  And since kids don't really like to have a whole movie about them, I was a little disappointed. (This review was written, after seeing the movie in a theater; I was really looking forward to having my kids in the theater, after spending about an hour and a half in the screening room. The movie had been shown in the U.S. in its entirety before; I remember the one hour TV special called "ROCKY TOP 10" or the 20 min movie "ROBB'S COLOR GAME" or some similar documentary.) That is an hour, 40 min movie about children.)   For my kids, the entire thing was shown at the theater and after they had left the theater with their parents. It was a very small part of "The Rock and His Friends."   I will say that the History Channel has done a good job of making a documentary about the origins of Rock and his friends, so I guess I am looking for more, I hope it's on the History channel.  I think it's hard for a child or an adult to get the history behind Rock and Smithers. Rock and Jim were friends and worked together for a long time, but I guess that's for kids. They didn't have to be children to understand that Rock didn't want to be a star and Smathers was just a huge, loud kid who didn't care about his fans and was a total jerk.  We're getting the full story now, don't have your kids learning this today...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was lucky enough to watch it last summer, and I didn't know it would be so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't get the chance to see what other critics had to say about this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was about a real tragedy, about two brothers, the one that died from cancer.   Why do you think a real person would want to see a film about them? The film would be good to have an intelligent discussion about the effects of cancer. Or it could be good for the public to see it so we can make sense of what's really going on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it was good, I would have to say it would be a different movie. I would really want this to be a movie that was entertaining and I was not really surprised about what happened after watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is loosely based on the true story of how the two brothers met when they were 7 years old in New York state.  There is a little bit of a conspiracy theory surrounding the actual origins of this story, because it is said to be based on John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas has a few more books to his credit.  The movie starts out with a "B" rating for an Independent film. In the book, the brothers were very young and not yet recognized as major actors, so I suppose they would have to write a whole other story, or have some other reason for being rated as such.  I can't think of any reason that they deserve that rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's funny, you know how these movies are made, I've been in the business for almost 10 years and I don't understand how it got released because the acting is horrible and the film is not worth watching or reviewing in its current state. I don' think there is any way to review it as a movie, unless you're like the person who actually did the film. There is no excuse for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even remember the title of this movie. There are two very important reasons for this, the first being that there are two actors playing the leads in the film, because we've got a guy who is the lead in the first film. There was a good reason to do that, to put the man's name in the front of the poster, and it's been done before, the idea of putting two guys in their respective roles for the two leads is so very unfortunate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a good story, the premise was good. They probably will be able to sell it in the future. I hope that the movie did not disappoint.  It is a shame that we have not seen the movie in its entirety. They may have gone to Hollywood to make an educational movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think it's really fair to call them independent, they should just call them the "independent film." They got the same treatment with the Independent Spirit Awards. The "independent" spirit award had this guy in it.   And, I feel like this movie is pretty heavy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of people have told me to look at it as an art film, it was this film's debut. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that would be at least nominated for a B-movie award, or maybe even a movie about a cult movie. In the movie the characters start out pretty good in that they are mostly all teenagers or so young that they were on their way out of high school, and they would have had to have been at least a couple of years younger than they actually are, and so you get the sense that they had to put on some more weight, just to really convince their victims that they should listen to them, and there is definitely some teenage acting. I think that the director did his best to make these characters look "good", so to speak, just because they were teenagers. I will also say that these were the same guys that made "The Blair Witch Project" so you could tell them what their ages were, in case you want to see them for what they really were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie more like a retelling of a play than a play.  I don't feel a connection to it. It could've been a straight movie. The only reason I have to review this movie is because it's not so bad and, of course, I love horror movies that are really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the movie on Showtime which is how I really knew what I was going to see.  I didn't have much interest in this movie.  There was something of a comedy element in it which could've been easily carried by the character and it might've worked in that it was a comedy and not a tragedy, which would have been the case for some characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To start off, I was the biggest fan of this movie. I was really hoping that it would be a film that would go all the way to Mexico and have it end with a big cliff hanger, an ending that would be one of the greatest movies of all time, I had been pretty spoiled by a number of movies in the past that ended the way I knew them to end.  In fact, this film has not only one,but TWO cliff hangers that really put it in its place as being a film tobutbutbutandandbutbutthe other cliff is in Mexico, and there is nothing else to it. This film ended on the "good" side of the cliff, which is not good enough in itself. It has been made clear by the film that it is a film about a "bad boy" and not a "good boy".  This film is about a hero, and a bad hero. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am one of those guys who likes to watch this sort of crap and so I'll keep this short: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was actually made as a documentary on how people react to these movies, about the impact of these films on different communities of people, so maybe I shouldn't say this, but I was at a screening, so I went to the movie, and I liked the way it was edited (I'm really interested in the way they try to portray people's personalities in documentaries) and the actors were all good. However, the way I watch these movies is to be on the lookout for something that would make the movie a little more accurate, like maybe having the same character in different communities. That's what this movie was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending may have been good.  If the film were made at the end of the day when everyone had died I would be very upset. This film is very depressing and not even worth watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, my review of this movie is a documentary on the life of the movie's producer, John Lennon, so I'm sure some of you out there know where I'm headed and I don't want to ruin it.  I do want to say that it's possible for someone like me to understand some of the life's of the actors in the film. After all, it's John Lennon who inspired so many people throughout the world, he was a creative artist and a poet as well as a musician and composer, so we do have something of a chance to understand the life and thought of some of them.  John's son, Yoko Ono, was killed in 1978 and he was found in a drug overdose on her front lawn and his death is still being investigated as far as who was involved and where she was killed.   As for the other actors, none of them are from a foreign country. No one in their right mind should have the heart to believe that this is their final performance. I'll give you a few examples: * The male lead is very unattractive, not handsome (with glasses and beard) as was John Lennon. * The female lead is a woman. This is also true of the male lead in the documentary "Love Will Bring You Closer", which was about his relationship with Yoko. This film is "John Lennon: The Life of John Lennon".  * The film is very boring. It is not a funny film. It goes on and on and then cuts to something else. I found it to be so hard to suspend disbelief (and it was really hard to watch, at all). There was so much potential here, such as a young John Lennon looking over his shoulder to John Lennon: "Hey, what's up? Come to the studio and record with me. Let's record our song..." * The music itself was very, very good. It was great to be able to hear some of John's singing. The songs of The Beatles were often very hard to find in this film, so perhaps the film makers had an idea of where the actors were from.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a remake of a movie that has been out for almost two years in the UK. The first "Escape" film came out in 1990. This is the only way the new version will get out on DVD in the foreseeable future. The original film was only available on DVD and the film was so good that I am hoping this film will get released on DVD. The only way I can see it getting out is on VHS format.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original film had some great actors, which they used in some of the best Hollywood films. The great performance by Richard Harris in Oliver Stone's "Platoon" had already been done. This film really started with a bang, but after three days I'm still sitting in the theater with a hangover.   This film is a real ripoff of "Olympia", which is a film made with the same producers. The acting, and the production itself, is not good, and is, without a doubt, something that should be shown for all to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first one had a lot of the gang in it--people that were friends and had made films together.   I am sure that the film director would have never dreamed of his life having ended up where it did after seeing the film the first time. This is a film directed solely by Steven Soderbergh--who has no real knowledge of filmmaking whatsoever, at all. As such, I feel no obligation whatsoever to recommend this film to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm old, I've seen movies in which people have really big roles and really good dialog, and I think that people of today have made movies about other people (and I think there are still more than a few of them) and I really wish that they would focus on the people who are in real need and who really need help in order to get better. I feel that people who make movies about these people in real-life situations are just making movies to make money and have really bad taste for it. The director did not make any effort to connect with the characters at all, it's not worth even looking at the first half hour, the second half hour is even worse. I wish there was an hour for me to write a negative reviews about such a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is funny to talk about. And it makes sense to me to say this (if it was only about a joke).butbutbutthemovie is not very funny and doesn't make the point of what it is trying to do. I liked the way the movie was made when they were talking about how it is a movie about love and how the movie had some sort of "cinematic" perspective, in how it looked at the beginning of the movie and how it talked about the relationship between my character and his character's character. As a film lover, I think it is very interesting to watch the "romantic" part of the story with the love of my character, and then at the same time, I like the idea of the relationship with a man and his dog. If this movie is the one I have made it seem like it was, I'd like to see what they have to say about this movie, and I would like to know what sort of story they were telling before this movie was released. (I was curious of the ending, and what it was like at the time of my last visit to this website, as it was released) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film, entitled "The Killer Inside Me", features several actors in it. This is a fairly small part of the film. The film begins with an FBI agent, the main character of which is investigating a serial killer and ends with the main guy's death by suicide. There's a bit of a history with this guy, in fact, he's played in this film in a small part by another guy, who is still alive and is a big star in "Maniac Cop" (1993) and "A History of Violence" (1991). In the meantime, this killer was, and is, a complete new character. The only thing that ties him in with his former, serial killer persona is the fact that he's been in a morgue. He was portrayed by an FBI rookie. I'm a former law enforcement officer, and when I saw him in a TV show, it looked like the same guy as the Killer, just a different hairstyle and a different look. This guy, the "Killer Inside Me" is in no way, shape, or form related to the man who was previously playing the "Death Master". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read and been involved with the history of the film, and in short, I was expecting to be watching a real history of this. I was disappointed by this. The acting is poor in almost every way. The movie is bad on all levels. I've read reviews of this film, so I can't give it the worst rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have been involved in the world of film then you'll know what I'm talking about. I'm not one to recommend the world to watch this because it's as bad as I'm hearing it, even though it is a really, really low budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie ever made of it's kind. I have absolutely no idea how they came up with the idea of making this movie. The best thing about the movie is that it's not the kind of movie I've heard so many people rave about. I am sure the actors did a great job for their roles in some of the other movies in this genre and I hope to be the one to review them. There are many great actresses who have appeared in this movie, I am just hoping they get it together with this one and come out with a movie that I can enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about 10 years old! I don't see the point of it. This was the movie that got me to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not at all funny and I'm sure it was not supposed to be a comedy either, and I was kind of laughing at the film for being too silly, as I didn't find the movie to be funny, funny, or even mildly entertaining. It was awful. It just made you watch it, in one form or another, just to see the end. It's a movie that would be fun to watch, and probably for young children or something. And, it just didn't make me laugh, nor smile.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that was made for television. They went to France and filmed it there, and they're in France, that's it. This is not a movie for people who hate to laugh. I'd recommend it to people who are on the verge of tears, or who have a sense of justice, but to watch this is the most boring, depressing movie I've ever seen. I was actually laughing the whole time I was watching this film. I'm a guy who loves to laugh (I have a real sense of humor), which is probably why it wasn't for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't imagine what other people must be going through that have made this film. The film makers may have come into some financial hardship and used some of their time and resources to work on it and help build a bigger, better film. I would love to have some knowledge of what they were doing and who was involved. They were clearly on a limited budget and had to make the best of what little they had to work with. I think it's fair to say they took some creative license with the movie and the plot and just for their own entertainment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about two teenagers, and has three directors in three different countries. It has a total of about 40-45 minutes. The movie takes place mainly in a small, rural village of about 700-800 people. The local villagers are the ones who live in the village of the movie.  The local police force is the only one who is ever seen in the movie, and his name and rank are never mentioned. The two leads, who go through a total about 10 or 15 minutes of screen time together, talk with each other at some point during the movie! One of the leads was on a school trip with two of her friends to a local restaurant. There is some talk of a school field trip or a small trip with the other lead in the town. They also go to a nearby college or to a movie theater. And they have conversations with some other people in the film.   I was very curious about the film when the local director told me that the local police officer was going to be in the picture, and that the film would feature a lot of dialogue between the police officer and the lead. After watching this I was just left speechless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this to be very unfunny, unfunny and poorly made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not going to go to any lengths to say I'm a "professional actor".  I was able to convince my agent, my manager, my agent's cousin that it was for my best interest to be in this film. She said there was a chance it would be a comedy, and I'm glad she did not go to that point. When I found out it was going to be a horror film (and I was the person who got the idea), I was hoping that I would be able to just walk into a movie, pick out a character, and say, "That's my role", because I'm hoping the person in the film knows that there is no one in that role. A great example of this is that the original remake of the film has an insane psychiatrist at the beginning of the movie, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is a "psycho" doctor and is psychotic. When he is talking to the characters on the film, they all appear to be talking to him like the movie was meant to be. And in the end, everyone is still talking like Hannibal Lecters brain is still trying to process what he's trying to say.  There is no excuse for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm just an ordinary guy who happened to find this, that doesn't mean I can give an objective opinion on this film. It's a piece of art. If a "great" director was asked about this, what would you expect? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's funny about this movie is the cast and the story, because I had seen all of these things.  My friend and I had to sit in this theater for the entire movie, and it was a real disappointment to both the cast, the director and the audience. I had nothing against the story and the idea of doing this movie, since I had been working on a similar story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be blunt, it's a bad and awful movie, it deserves one of the worst movies ever, especially for it being made in the 1970's. I could get used to the acting of a good 1940's Hollywood movie. A good 1940 Hollywood movie would have been made in 1946, as it was when I saw it in 1948.  The entire movie was filmed in 1958, and the whole premise of this movie was to give you an idea of how I did the same thing as a "film noir" - a very interesting subject for a "noir" movie, especially with how it is portrayed by the "black-haired" woman played by Lucille Ball.  To add to my rant about this movie, I don't know if I can really call myself a good actor.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why the reviewers in the theater don't just walk into the theater to see the film. They walk in, they see that it is the final film (or even at the beginning). They have the same expectations as I do, which is that this is the last film. We saw the same movie with Jim Carrey on the last one, who did the final scenes of it. What else is there to say? And if you can make it through the end of it and see a happy ending...I will give you my $10 to be one of those people who sees that for yourself. This was not it at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find it hard to comprehend and just make the effort to watch it, since I have found other people's reactions online. This is the first movie of the series, and there is no reason for a sequel to be released. This could very well be the second movie, since the other two movies are much better than this one. I am looking for answers in the comments section for the people who have made comments in the past few days, and for those who make comments on the TV show itself, about this movie, so I'll get them straight and tell you the truth, as this was supposed to be an honest review of the movie I've just watched and review it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say that it was my first film and, indeed, it's not very good at all because it was a low budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, is a remake, or remake of the original movie, i have seen many remake of movies, and this one, is the biggest one i've seen, but it's also the worst movie i've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing I didn't like is the fact that this was a family movie, or the fact it wasn't on CBS (I guess they don't want to waste time). I'll leave that alone.  I'll be honest. The fact it was a "real movie" and not just a cheap film doesn't seem worth the price of admission to me, let alone the $6. The only positive review I could give was for the film itself and the fact I knew what it was going to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you were lucky enough to see this in video, you would have liked this movie because it was a straight-to-video sequel. This movie is a straight "movie about my life" that I will always remember aboutbut it is a bad one, the movie is about bad things.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that the producer and I gave to our friends and family. We hope that this is still a work in progress and that by the time it hits the DVD shop it will have been re-edited in post production. (The video of the "pre" work is in the video store, not in post.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't really get into the movie.  I mean, they just kind of dropped me into it. They didn't even let me leave the bar and I still went home with the movie, which is kind of weird considering the bar I just left. And they had some good actors that could have made a movie like that movie. Just a pretty depressing, I'll tell you that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed. Why, am I supposed to expect the worst? I find myself thinking to myself, "Why was this made?" I'm not a bad film by any means. I'm also a fan of Woody Allen's work. Why do people make movies about him like this? He has the misfortune of being associated with the very worst thing that has ever happened to the film industry in terms of this. I hope it's not too late for the man, because this was not the finest of movies, nor was it the funniest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie for adults only, and should be viewed as a comedy. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it is based on a comic book by someone like Larry Lieber. I didn't watch the first movie because I was worried about how it would fare. I am very disappointed with the movie because there is absolutely no humor in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw it with a few friends.  The idea was pretty good. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie when she and the other girl are hanging out in the house together, which takes place between them. I think the movie is pretty similar to "Possum" in that it's a horror movie with some silly elements that just come out of nowhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about the search for a killer (who has been "blind" or "deaf" or whatever the case may be). The only person with a voice in the movie is a "franchise spokesman" for the movie. I don't think that the film was really intended for a family film and the kids are supposed to be "grown up" (though of course that would be a family movie). There are a lot of "scenes" in the house that are just for the film, so we have the entire house, including the laundry room, and all of the kids and their parents (even the dog!) all hanging out in the kitchen. I didn't even want to take the kids to the park or to the beach (let alone a nice movie) and just want to see them grow up (and not spend an hour there with their heads hanging). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I didn't have a sense that "The Big Picture" was going to be a movie at all. This isn't a true depiction of what happened in the movie. The movie has a very simplistic and poorly thought out, and very predictable plot. A "simple" plot is a story that can be told in a minute, or a hundred, or three. This movie does not work well in a film that is very serious, or serious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really curious about this movie since I'd read about a female lead in "The Virgin" and was a fan of the idea that the director was going to be directing a female film. I'm sure that there were a number of women who wanted to be directors and were at least as talented as I am. I do believe that there's still more to be discovered in the world of female film makers (I love Jane Austen's work), so this was very disappointing. There are a number women who make movies every day in Hollywood. They should not be put in their place in a bad film like this one. I hope that this does not happen to a female director, and that they are able to change the script and make something good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know I don't want to be critical here, or like to be the target of such comments and so on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if my review was dated or what, but I am not the only one that sees it. They have no idea why they ever greenlighted it or how they are going to be able to sell it to anyone, who will probably end up buying something else. I don;t understand why people are so enthusiastic about seeing it on Amazon. Don;t waste your money, unless you want to see what a really bad movie looks like and get a glimpse of the effects in it. I have to say that I found this movie pretty boring. It is so boring, it's painful to watch. I really don't care about the plot, and the actors are absolutely terrible.  I'm sorry I spent any money to get this movie, it deserves nothing. The movie's "humor" could be taken seriously because, let's face it, who wants to sit through it. Don't waste your time on this film, unless a kid's birthday is coming up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you watch a bad TV show, you'll see it's bad TV-series. If you were to watch the TV show "Death Note", it's the same bad TV series. What good would this have been in the movie "Death note". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited about this movie, so many words could be used to describe how excited I was.  A friend of mine got me involved in this movie. He was the first one to watch the movie back when it was out on VHS. He's been through so much and is not going to just throw in the towel now. But alas, I'm going to stick with the first reviewer here, because he's been an adult and can still understand what this movie is trying to do (that's what made it great when he watched it). This is not a movie I want to spend the hour I'm stuck on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever! If you want to sit down and have a laugh and just watch a comedy, you can, and you won't get the same satisfaction from the flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it was about a month ago in the paper. I remember a show on Showtime called "The Dead" (which was a show about this particular group of people). My wife and I watched this show on TCM channel 7.  I'm not going to waste my time on this show. It should just be called "Dead." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In fact, I'm amazed that this movie was made with any kind of budget. What can you expect from a film with such a low budget, that it even got to be the subject of a discussion on this website.  The movie's plot is completely unbelievable. The best way I can describe it is ridiculous, and you should give it some thought. It's just a silly piece of "art", made by an art student trying to "entice people" with a few crummy drawings.  As far as "creature design", it's really bad, just like every "movie" or "tape" I've ever seen. I gave this movie "4". It's a film to watch as a parody of that terrible "movie with the bad guy" called "The Matrix", and even that is good, because it's a spoof. This movie is "art". It doesn't even come close to being art. I'm going to take my advice and see if there was a film from a local college student and give it a grade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to write a lot about the film itself, since I just watched it, because it's just not good, I'm very surprised that they did such a good job, because I was very familiar with the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well first, I am from the United States and so am used to this. If you are not used to it and are coming from another country, it will be a shocker. If I want to know how many people on the planet have seen this movie, I would guess about 3. I am not that great a actor, I was actually nominated for Best Actor in the last film in that category, and I don't expect to be able to pull off the role of a "real" actor. Now, I also had done "Gardeners" before, or at least the original "Gardens", which was a horror film, so I am used that sort of "art house" type of film, where I would try to keep things more real and simple, and in this film I will not be trying to do any of these things, because the story was poor, and made me extremely sad. This film was not really well edited, the story, and the end was very depressing and pointless. It makes no sense, and, worse, not worth even one minute of my time, if that makes sense. There are also several minor "jokes" throughout the film which are just bad choices to make light of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember when this movie was on the "X-treme Movie" channels... It was a comedy about a bunch of guys in masks and running around and being crazed. I don't think it was meant to be a comedy. It's not a really good movie and I don d know the story that is told to the people who did make the movie before. I am afraid that the director and writer are probably still making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did manage to get my hands on the DVD and rent this because I saw the reviews online, and so I wanted to like this movie. I really, really wanted to get the message that we had to help a homeless person in my hometown, that was my reason for going and seeing it, and after reading it, that message is buried under so much garbage. I can't even count how many times I have watched this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my last day of school and I took it into the principal's office, as an adult who wanted to make it through to my next class. The school was in the middle of the night, so I had to show up early for school the next morning.  I had seen a video in high school of an entire school acting and learning with the play set, and was expecting the play to be the same as a movie, a play about history and character, with all the principals and teachers doing their best. I did see a clip from "Babe, Come Home" on a local movie channel, which was really funny. They had to pretend they were the real characters, then they had to try and act in it. This was a big disappointment, because I thought I was watching a play, which would have been a complete comedy. It was terrible, and the movie is a mess. The play set would have cost a small fortune. There is a play in "Babes" where you just walk in to a castle, which is totally unrealistic. That was an entire play set in a castle that is made of plastic, and now I want to be a part of this play set. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just me, but the movie is a weird mess with horrible lighting and awful editing. You can even watch the movie on video and see how much better the cinematography is, or you can rent the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a movie-hater; I have a problem with this movie. It's as bad as you can make it. I mean, the camera-work is so amateur that it's ridiculous. I can't stand it. The worst part is that the guy in it. He is an idiot and the guy's stupid acting is awful. If you want to see it, buy it.  The movie is bad, but, I'm surprised it was actually a great idea to make a film about this crap. I don't recommend it, and it's a pity that they couldn't just edit it down to a terrible mess for it to be a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no redeeming value whatsoever. This film was shot in the U. It's like it was made in Hollywood. The director should be ashamed of himself. If you like the movie, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even know where to begin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film was a comedy, about a bunch of hippie rockers hanging out at a beach club. This one is the result of a very bad idea, made up by this film's cast and director. As bad as this movie is, at least it's better than that of the original, which was simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After being so excited about the book and being so certain that this was going to be the best movie ever (and, in fact, seeing the book cover to be very close to that), I am a huge fan of the book, and I was really hoping to see a movie that I was going see when I was buying the book. It's not the book that I read, or it is not the movie. So, after spending an hour of my life watching this, I just couldn't figure out what the hell this movie was. It had all the same "flavor" as a lot of the other bad-taste trash. To even go ahead and rate this as a comedy, or even try to describe it in any way, I don't think it's fair to movie-goers or the author, and if they were to go by what I read and heard, I would give it one and half star for the movie I would have liked to see. That is, the film is so bad that it has absolutely no redeeming feature. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies where the director was just trying to find the next job and the money was involved and the actors involved were desperate and dumb. We could barely make it through half an hour of a movie that was supposed to be about the first-ever "The Man From Gunga" in 1938. We'd like to be in a real hurry to see how bad a movie this was. The reason why I gave this one a 9/10 is because of the first 60 minutes, which were a comedy. I hope that someone did a comedy about how bad and bad it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a big fan of the Dukakis administration, or the one before that, or even the one I served in (though I did spend four years in the Marine Corps, so maybe I am a tad biased) The first thing that popped into my mind was, hey, that's how this film started, when I was writing about this film being a "drama", which is just the one movie about the Marine's story and the one about the "mobilization". It's like watching a "political thriller" in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was so bad and disgusting. It was so gross. It had the same hair. It didn't have the same skin. If they were in the same hospital it wouldn't be that gross, and that's what this looks like.  This movie was so horrible that it didn't get released. I rented the original "The Naked Gun" and I thought I was just gonna watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a film buff, this is an extremely slow, cheesy and uninspired movie. The main reason for that is the fact that the people who directed this movie are actually really talented and don't waste their time and energy on this. I mean, these are some of the biggest film fans in the world, and it's a big shock to me to see them so focused on this film. And, honestly, they probably want to get on with their lives and come back to life. I just want to be honest with the audience, as I've already said, about their involvement in this movie and how it affects the future of the film and the lives of the main characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like when you go to a movie theater: This is the one movie where I haven't rented it, and if I wanted to rent it, I would rent it.  I feel like the only reason it is available is because of a friend of mine who is a good friend of the producer. I didn't know it would be a big deal. It doesn't fit into the "small budget" I'm sure it could have been an "R-rated" movie and not been "small" and "low budget" and I thought it would fit in the film "Rise," which is only about 40 minutes longer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with the opening credits.  I don't want to go through this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that this was the first film of this movie, or the second, third, fourth. I would certainly agree that the original movie was quite slow, maybe not fast enough for the older person in me. I think that the first two were more of a mystery, and so I would have no qualms about making a movie about these people. I really like mysteries, because of the suspense, which would, in my opinion, be enhanced if they were made. I just don't know that this one is any of the better films in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Man in His Time" is an interesting documentary on the "origin of the human race" and the "life of Adam and Eve", or the "creation of man". I really don't care for this movie. It seems that this is only a few of the "A man in his time" documentaries. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, when I was in high school I used to call movies such as "The Dictator" (which was in the UK) "The General" (because we were British, of course) or, for example, "The Wizard", I was a very bright student, and was the proudest member of my high school, so when I go back and watch the film I find that the characters are so utterly horrible and unbelievable, and I was so angry and sad for the people involved in this. The acting is atrocious. It could very easily have been made a masterpiece (for all I know). I have had to see this movie with a bunch of my friends, and they are completely bored by it. It's so bad. The film just drags along and I don't know how a person could possibly enjoy this film. It is terrible. I am not a fan of either John Lithgow or Gary Merrill, so I guess this is a really crappy film with two leading men, and the film is bad in every way imaginable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In what is probably the most politically correct movie of all time, it's hard to find the connection between the political beliefs and the movie.  I give this movie a 3 rating for the sake of the rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit that the movie could be shown as a true story about an alcoholic who drinks beer. In my opinion, it's a pathetic excuse for a movie that should never have been made. In a movie theater, I'd have to recommend it to be shown on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a serious drama.but unfortunately, it was all filmed at the same time, and the same location.  I'm sure there were multiple people with my brother and me, and at least one of us went out on the lake, and that would have been a very good day to shoot it. The director, for whatever reason, decided that he wanted to go over to a different location, and shoot something else. It is not entirely clear why he did this, and it must have been his own personal choice. He and his brother are still young enough to get away with it, and could have easily walked around to another location to do the whole movie, and then returned to the Lake Michigan location, or even gone to the lake's other location in Detroit, which is very nearby. If I had any clue what he was trying to do, he'd have to do a comedy play. His brother is 5'7", he's 7"3", he wants to be "funny", and he can still do the same, and even a good comedy with this, could probably be made.  There is also a scene where my brother (the camera) falls into the water and gets a big splash, which, when the camera gets close up to the water, gives you the impression that the water is much bigger than it really is. I didn't think I was the only one that saw it at the lake with our family, the director had a camera on the surface, and he took it for granted that the lake was so big that it would look more or less like that scene. The camera was set up so far out from the shore that we can see the outline of the shore, and there's a point where it is almost underwater.   In my opinion, this is the only scene in the whole film where the director is actually underwater, and I was watching. In the movie, he falls into one of the lakes, not into another lake, so he had a great time doing it, although I think I should probably have seen the water depth. He also did a great job portraying thebutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbuttbutbutButbutbutthoughbutbutalthoughbutbutbecausehe was able to make his own bad luck.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Forgive me, it's only a few days later... I have no idea. Maybe, if I'm lucky, I can find a good friend to watch it with me. Maybe I can get the movie to the DVD library of the local public library... Then, I'll see if they'll pick this over a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a real "B" movie to me. It wasn't just the poor acting that got me. If you look at the poster you'd think I'm an 18-year-old who doesn't have any knowledge of acting. It was awful and unprofessional. I mean it was so bad I wouldn't even have bothered to finish watching it. It's ridiculous and ridiculous! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching a documentary about this movie when it came out. I was also in the film, and I know people who are still around who knew who I was, and they saw me there for only a few minutes. And the people that I was around knew who they were with me, but I'm gonna guess that it's hard to figure out exactly who is in there. Maybe the director can help figure that out. This is about the second feature that I saw at the museum, about "Kiss of Death," which had the director, director of photography, and all the rest of them.  So yeah, yeah I'm super stoked to see the first one. This one's got me really pumpedbutbutitbutbutbutthat's not enough to figure this out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the opening ten minutes I knew this would be a thriller. I've seen dozens of independent thrillers and movies, I have no idea how they did this. They went straight to the studio, and I'll do it for you, if you think you're getting the inside scoop on how this movie was made, you will be shocked, I was so disgusted with it, the people involved with this movie should be ashamed, they're an insult to everything they do in the world.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this as a comedy in the local movie theater. It was supposed to be a comedy, a slapstick, etc. I can say with confidence that I did not enjoy the film. To me it's the sort of movie that comes out of a dark theatre. If you like a certain movie, I'm sure you'll find some movie that doesn't go the way the director intended. It's just a bad film. You are stuck with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not a comedy, because it does not follow any of the old jokes that come to mind when one thinks of comedy. This movie follows the classic comedy formula, but does not always get there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The DVD release of this movie is the only way to get this movie to you, which is a reason to give it. The DVD was not released in the UK for any reason, so no way was I to even rent or buy a copy of the DVD in the last two days of my holiday, which left me with no choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First, there was the argument that a movie that centers around a gay film would be about gay culture. I thought that this movie would make more of an impact than the "Tropic of Cancer" because, in the late 70s, a lot of the gay community was still reeling from the effects of the AIDS crisis.   Secondly, this movie deals with the problems and issues faced by gay men. If you are a guy who is looking for a message to share with your gay friends about something other than your sexual orientation, this is it.  This movie doesn't do the very best job of trying to be "nuanced" and "sympathetic". For example, if a gay guy decides to be gay and try to tell his gay friends that he has cancer (and he has been diagnosed) because he is gay, the very next time he comes to visit a doctor, the doctor might try to explain to his gay friend that this is not the case. It is a "bad movie" in the sense that it attempts to be an "anti-gay movie".  As far as I can tell, there were not really any messages about "how to be a good gay man", about how to be supportive of the straight community (as opposed to being a good friend), or how to "accept your gay friend" or "love your gay brother".  The movie focuses on trying to show the effects, and problems faced by straight people, and that was not really the intention of the movie.  It would be nice to see a straight male movie that depicts "how it was like in the 70s" and a gay one with all these issues and problems...  I was kind of curious to see what sort of messages the movie would be trying to convey, as the movie ended up getting kind of cheesy and fake, as it tries to be more honest and "realistic".   My only complaint was with the "Hollywood" (i.e. the movie theater) version of this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Movie" is actually a pretty decent one, and there were only two or three actors in "The Movies" that were really well known (like Gene Simmons), and some of the actors in the other "The movies" had made some movies or came from the stage, or had made very short, short films, so that the audience had to pay attention to the actors, because of how bad they were.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it at a film festival, it was a special, or something, this is the only thing I can recommend. I didn't like "O.R.G." The O.R., you know that movie... I found it to be one of the best of that genre. "R.E.T." was like a "Widescreen" movie, and it's the same film as this. I don't like some of the dialogue of "R,E.M." The "O,R." "Wes" and the "O's" is the same as the previous O.G. The "Wise Words" is in the same place, and all that. That's all that I have to say about the movie. The only other thing that has to do with the film is that the soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a huge fan of the original Batman, you won't know what your doing. You've got the first two, the one that was very crude and very much like the original.  I would have to say that the original was so much more violent than this version. I don't know if it's just because this version doesn't have the original's original composer who is still alive, and that has been replaced by "a great, big composer" (no word on this). Maybe I've just gotten used to this stuff. Maybe it's because it is so dark and quiet. The soundtrack is sobutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutbecause of the way that it was recorded.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so boring it almost qualifies as a joke. You get a headache just seeing it from the beginning. The acting is terrible. I'm not even going to write a positive review about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was actually hoping that the movie would be at least moderately good, but one reviewer, who actually wrote a positive review about the movie (myself), says that it was a serious work. The movie was really slow, and the acting was pretty bad, though I was expecting some good Italian or French actors (not all Italian and French films are of Italian or European origin). Some of the film was in black and white, so I couldn't really see what was going on, though that's about all there is to say about the film at the moment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like Tom Cruise's character, who has been around a long time and is an accomplished actor. So, I would expect Cruise in this film to be playing a man who is a leader and, well, I am guessing that's the role that he will be playing for the rest of his career, because no matter how many years have passed, he's still Tom Cruise.  I don't really understand why he's playing the role of the "bad" guy and his actions are very similar to those of the bad guy in the "Mako Mermaid" film.  This film is the same crappy movie that it started out as with the opening credits. It was released on video so, the whole world knows what the movie is going to be like, and, in a strange way, I find it sad to see my Tom Cruise as the "hero" in this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why anyone would watch this movie. I would rather see it again, maybe for a DVD or a "replay" situation, or for an episode of a TV show, like this movie was the only real reason to watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I know the movie was made before my movie was released, and there will be some similarity in the acting of the two (my parents both have been in the movie business for several years), I'd really love to hear from others, as that would be really cool. Secondly, I didn't think it would be that hard to figure out. In the late eighties, before I was born, there was only one movie in the world, and it was called "MOUTH OF THE PLANT", a movie about the mouthing off of the plant. If I recall correctly, this was the only movie in existence that had the word "Plant" in it. That was "TIMES IN PLACE", which was released in 1980, so I know that if you want to look it up. If anyone was to watch it, he'd be able to see that it was not a surprise to anyone. The people involved with the production of this film were the type of people that would know exactly how to make the movie they wanted to make, so the word of someone who didn't know a thing about making movies is going to come across as the most credible one. The film was rushed to finish it and was in fact rushed to be released. I mean, it really did not make sense, and the film really didn't make it to be the film that it should have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is about a man who comes to town and decides to become a priest in order to find love. So you have a guy who is going to be a priest, and who is being told how much love is in his life by the priest, who is telling him that he has no hope in finding love.  The ending is an insult to anyone who wants to see a positive review about the movie. I would say that anyone who actually sat down and watched this movie would probably have to call their mother before they could even watch this over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical '80s B movie with no redeeming qualities. I was absolutely fascinated by the book and the idea of a film about the real world and the way the characters were supposed to behave,but this film tries to remake it with '80's B-movie sensibilities and, unfortunately, does a fair job of that, so I give this movie the rating of 4.1/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the movie for being such an intelligent, honest, and accurate account of the "Montclair Massacre", which happens in a similar manner to the one in Montclair, New Jersey, in which James Earl Ray murdered a young, married couple named William Mahone and Jean Arthur Mahone. I saw no such account in the film, and I would have to rate it at least a 1 for the film's ability to make a movie about the Montclair Massacre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't watch the series, but that show was so popular, it had no small impact. In fact, it is one of the most popular TV shows of all time, in the US. With an animated series, I thought the production values would be the same, with the fact that the animation is already pretty damn good, with all the characters in it. This is the case with thebut, there is a pretty huge difference between the two. I did really like the way the animation in the first episode was very close to the look of an 80's cartoon, and in that it was kind of "retro" and would mimic the way that the characters are dressed.   The second episode (which was the same exact animation that was in the previous episode) had a pretty good look at it, and it was just a few years ago. The whole thing looks like the early days of the animated series and it's a complete disaster. The characters are so hideous. It's just awful, and completely horrible. I don,t recommend this cartoon to anyone, and I gave it one rating because it was in syndication on ABC and they are actually airing the episode that follows this one on the "Power Rangers" (the other two episodes from this series). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to give credit to this movie because it is a comedy.  You can call it a "straight" comedy--it is not as bad as people make it out to be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the "special features" on this DVD, was a feature about this film titled "Mystery of the Unidentified". This movie, if you ask me, is a "documentary", not an "immersion" piece of film. There was no plot, a confusing "art style", no real feeling of "being in the world" for the main character, his friend, his girlfriend, his friends (he was apparently looking for a good girl...?), all of which is the very reason the movie is "so bad". I wouldn't recommend it at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to the theater with some friends because I was interested in this movie. I rented it to see a friend of mine. We rented it as a family movie. It's a good story but it is not a very good film. There is a lot of stuff going on in the movie that's just stupidly done. We have a bad boy, a bad girl, a boy who is supposed to be a boy, an evil boy, etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty much what the original game is.  The story line is extremely stupid and uninteresting. In this "movie", I'd really advise anyone interested in the game to watch the game over and over again, which would tell you what happens in the main story, not what happens here. There's really no point in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a few of my friends who have seen a lot of other movies or who've seen good movies, who are good actors. I've also seen a handful of my female friends who are "tough chicks" and who are in their prime. I don't know if they're good actors, and I don not recommend you watch this movie in a group setting with friends that aren't really your friends because you know what it is like. The women in the movie are just very pretty, attractive, and they're just so beautifulbut they're not really funny. There are a few good comic characters.  (Tristin Hartman and Amy Smart and some of the characters in the short-lived sitcom, "I Love Lucy" which was on the WB, and in this short-film, Hartman is a comic genius that had a great role in the original "I, Robot"). Also there are some other really smart funny women who are smart people.  The guys don't have any sense of comedy. They're all so stoned.  I just saw this movie because I saw that the WB was screening it in front of me and they said they'd show me a clip and I thought that was pretty funny. They showed me a short clip that I like and think is so clever in the way they have Hartman play a robot that he has programmed to be so smart. The scene with him sitting on a coffee table and playing a computer game made it seem like he was in a good mood and it's just so ridiculous. I think if the movie had been "Suspense" or something, then it would have just been a short film and not this. I just thought it's funny to see the scene from the short, and it really made me laugh, that they could get into how high they were going to get in the robot's mind to get the funny part.  This movie is so incredibly stupid and boring, just horrible. I could not believe that it's made by Warner Brothers. I would advise anyone who sees this to keep your expectations low, just get the DVD of this movie and rent it off the WB. The DVD of "Robot Jox" is worth buying or renting, and if you like this movie to see me laugh. It's pretty funny, I actually would rate this movie highly. There's some great moments in it, like the scene with Hartman's smart computer character and the scene of his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's too early to be the only movie from "The Invisible Man", or whatever this movie is called, but whatever they do have in it, they sure make a good impressionbutbutthey just didn't have enough of it, and they weren't going to go full-blown psycho and make the movie as scary as they were supposed to, or at least they were going to do an extreme, very "The Shining" type of thing, or they were gonna throw in a lot of horror elements that the film had in it already... and that's not the only reason why the film ended up that way... the film was pretty dark. It was pretty spooky... and I like scary, scary films... and if I had been to see it, I'd have loved it... the "Elders of the woods" film had very, very spooky elements and it was a really scary film! This was very,but there was the same kind of atmosphere that I got in "Elder of the forest". The elders don't have to come into the film and start out menacing a town full of people in an old abandoned house full of creepy ghosts (so the elder film had a very different vibe to it). This was basically a real town, and a real place, but it wasn't as "real" as a real city. "The film was in black and white, with red and green" as I remember, and it had a lot less red and less green than a lot the older one I'd seen, and I think this was because the older ones had very creepy shots of people, who had real creepy effects, and that was it. This was more like a "documentary" type thing (like, there was no actual "documentation" about how they were living in that house, or the weird old house that they were trying to recreate). It was weird, almost like they weren the first "film" and they used to live in that place. They couldn't possibly know what they were in for, not knowing exactly how things were going on. It doesn't get better for a second of what's going on around that house. It's not like it really makes sense to even begin to pretend that a "real ghost" would want to exist in that sort of place, let alone act like it. There are some "gimmicks" that were made at the end (the old house has one that supposedly had to be haunted
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first film, the lead actor (the original) had the screen time to make a movie about the life of James Joyce, a real person, an Irishman.   That character, the real, would've been the director's lead.  The character in this film is just a few lines long, not even close to the life size character portrayed in the first movie. The character's actions are not as real, not as innocent, and certainly not as true to James Joyce's character as they should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was interesting to compare it with another film, which was a remake of the original film. It was good to compare that movie with the original one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really into this movie when I saw it on HBO. I was watching the movie for the DVD release. This is the movie they put out on VHS, with the same actors, same title, the same director, the first one. The title is "Wizard of Oz" so it seems that they're trying to market this as an Oz movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the first thing that comes on the VHS tape. We saw this film at a preview screening and it is my personal opinion that the previews should not be seen by those who are not completely interested. There are some really good and really sad moments in this film and I would certainly encourage you to view them and appreciate them, but unfortunately the movie came out in a limited run of just two theaters in New York City, and I was able to see it in both. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am so embarrassed of this movie, I'm so ashamed of myself. To watch this movie is repulsive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is more about the band and the music. The band was pretty good, they put out one record that I like, and they were in the early 70s. The music has not aged well at all, the movie is not good, it just doesn't go anywhere near the other side of the coin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen any movie before in my life that was as funny, good or entertaining as this bad movie.  I'm in tears when I'm trying to watch this movie. I had just seen the original "The Big Chill" and found that that was an amusing movie. "The Cooler" is more of a horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw this, I thought that "it was going to be an action movie." It was directed by John Sturges (Brigadoon), and he was one of the most renowned actors of the time (the title of his last movie, Bravehearts, was John Sturgs, and the first movie was a comedy), and it was a satire. It's not that I think this is a comedy, it's just that in this movie, there are so many things that make it harder and harder to make it entertaining.  I give this movie an eight out of ten. It should be called, "It's not good enough to be a film!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only real connection I could make with some of the other people at the movie was some of their comments and that one could be seen in a few comments here. A lot of the movie is about my relationship with my wife. Some of the people who saw this film actually saw some of my interactions with the director about how I was at work when she left and, of course, didn't know I had lost my wife when she came home. In that way the director could really be seen to be very negative in the movie, because I really didn't see any connection between my character and the one in the picture, not to mention that she's only in it for about 5-10 minutes at the end of the film before the end credits roll. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For my taste, the movie was really stupid. I think it's a pity, it's only my taste. I like "Dead Man Walking".  I know it's just a cheap action movie, like the movie "Black Box".  The story is just ridiculous.   There was no good excuse for it to be any sort of an action movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I knew what happened to the other actress and that actress I would go to see this one as an action-thriller.  I have no doubt that it will be an action or film with a twist. That is the way of the film world. It seems that all of the actors were on a green-screen lot. And they were all green-lighted for the shoot. There was nothing in the movie that would give a hint of what their lives would be like.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has the same actors as the previous one. The director has no artistic ability at all. The film starts at the beginning. I watched this film on the Friday afternoon when there was nothing in this movie. The idea behind this film was a clever comedy about how this movie was like a classic of the 90's like How The Grinch Stole Christmas. So if you have ever seen the film How The God Made Me (1995) you will recognize the feeling. The movie was released in 1990 and has since been released on DVD and on video. The plot was an action-adventure film, which has been used in the past. What makes the 90s version the best is the character development of the character's. We had a young girl, a girl in college, a young boy, an old woman, a woman with long hair, and a couple of older women in this film who were not played by any of the actors in the 90′s version. We'll have to give credit to the production team for thinking up and casting this film in the 1990′s.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the "only" film of the four-film series, because the others were made by Disney Studios. There are no plot lines, no character development, and it doesn't even begin to justify the cost of renting it. In fact, Disney had to pay an insurance claim to the estate of Mary Blair, one of the producers of this film, who won a settlement for all of the legal fees, to put the film in its current state.

You get the idea that if you are to get into the specifics of any of these things, it was going to be more interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film, the "Troy" character was very similar to him in looks (and was played by Walter Matthau).  I thought that "T" would become "T'R" or "T.T" or something similar, because I would have a reason to. And while the character was a lot different than that of Troy, Matthau, "Tyr" was not the same man. The one from the first film is handsome and has a more muscular body, and he looks a little more mature, he is the same height, he looks just as tall as "T", he has the same "T"-shaped ears, he's bald and his hair is longer and more straight. The difference is that he has an ugly, pale face, and his eyes have sunken, and the nose has become slanted to his forehead. "T." also has a mole in the left eye. "Weird."    "T"'s" mouth is slightly slanted as well, so you can actually see a line, or a white line from his mouth, and I guess it's his mustache he has that slanted into his upper lip, which I wouldn't really like, he has a really ugly, big nose and his lips are just awful, too big for a "T". In "T'"s" voice, you can't even distinguish whether he's in a voice that's his own, or is on a tape recorder. "Honey, I can't do this anymore, I have got to find my voice, I must find the voice in the mirror and then find a recording studio that can do that! It makes me want to put some paint on my face!"   Well, the one good thing that there was in the previous film was his good looks, since he was, at least, the face of a boy, he would be the first person to admit that he's got a pretty pretty face, so "T's" facial hair was pretty terrible, so he had it grow. The next time he has to find a female voice actor, "Holly" did a pretty good job with that. And that's because she'd done a great job with Holly's character in "Tales From the Crypt" and I think it's a pretty feminine voice, the sort that could actually pass for a girl voice, he needs a female-voice. And, if you have ever, you know, been

This is a really dumb movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was in the late 80's or early 90's when it was just a movie called "Voyage to the Moon." The only thing this movie was really filmed was to shoot the scenes in the ocean. And there are no "special effects" for the "moonwalk" scene...the "moon" itself is only a little lighter than the other film, and in many ways is more primitive than the original "Moon" movie. The film is also not very entertaining to watch. The script has so many clichés and so many dumb scenes. For example, one scene in particular has an evil "monarch" (involving a robot or a talking computer) sitting around in a library reading about a "discovery" of an "ancient evil empire" that "included the reign of Yokoi, who was the first emperor of Japan." This is, simply put, a dumb movie. If it wasn't bad enough that you can't make a better movie (and that is the only reason to watch it), then it gets stupid after a few minutes of playing. Even the "discoveries" of a few things that are very interesting for the sake of science-fiction-based science-and-technology analysis and speculation, such as the history of Japan and the role of modern Japan, are presented and explained in an utterly superficial, shallow fashion. It doesn't help that it was directed by Tetsuro Ishiguro who makes a mockery of every Japanese movie he ever makes. He's got an Italian accent. (Not exactly an "emperor" of the ancient "monarchy.")  It's bad enough you can just think that this is all Japanese trash, although since he's Italian, I imagine that the "monarchs" are Italian trash, so he makes fun of it. This is also "badly" made, and even the actors don't manage to capture the spirit of the original movie. This movie does make you think that the whole time you're watching it that you're seeing an excellent, deep and detailed historical documentary about Japan's history and culture, that is what's going to happen when you're with a bunch of other people (such as those who actually do read Japanese history and literature, in other words), and, when you go and sit down and read the actual script, you might find some sense in them being involved in the production of this film.  The script is like something a "modern
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to see a true American film with an American cast. I have seen more than my fair share of movies with American actors and this one was as bad as the British film was good. The script is horrible and it's very hard to follow everything that happens. The main actor (I don't even wanna know who he is) tries to change his own character into the main character in one scene. The best actor in this movie is the best actor I know and I saw him at the beginning and he doesn't come in to this film. A true American hero would not fall for the 'B-movie' and don't make the same mistake that the great William Holden (Pleasantville, Joy Luck Club, etc.) did. This is the most ridiculous 'B' film in the history of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could have had a plot, a good ending, like it could have been released on video. There are some people in the movie.  I mean, how many people are still alive in the world? And I'd like to be the first person to say that the story of this movie is boring and pointless. I'm glad that I didn't watch it with anyone else, since I did enjoy the short film, and I just went to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to be as harsh as possible, as if I was not a fan of this movie, this is really a case study in how not to develop a good movie. The whole premise of the movie is the same, the characters and the storyline are terrible. It's obvious the movie will make you angry and sad and even laugh at how awful the movie really is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie based on the book "Little Women". This movie is based on "Little Men", the "Little Ladies", "Little Gentlemen" and the "little Ladies" (that I'm sure there were other books based on), and I've actually read the book and I didn't like it very much. I found the men in the book to be kind and sympathetic and I thought it would be pretty funny to have them "play" with little ladies and have them become the little ladies of the book, just because "Little Man" was a big part of the story. I also found that the "man-hating" women in the movie were the kind of women who I liked and I found myself sympathizing with them, they were not portrayed as the big ladies that are the main characters of the novel, that would be a good idea for them to try and make them into such a good little lady, because I just think the movie is going to disappoint all of us, especially the little girls who are going to love this book, because they're not going to get the "story" of the little man in the picture (not by the way, not one word in the "plot" of this movie, and I think they probably get the next best thing to "Little Woman"). The Little Man is so interesting and interesting, so let me give this movie my best effort in my little movie career. butbut this "story"? Let's see. I've already described the "brief" outline of the Little Man in the novel and I can't help but feel like the "movie is going full circle", just because of the fact that it's been shown in the other "Little women" movies. I'm not going into it too deeply, I have my opinion about it, but it was done in the Little Women movies to illustrate the point of the film, that the little men who try to have a "little man's life" aren't really able to live up to the "role model" of Little Man.  That is pretty harsh, and you can't really do "that" to the Little Men. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like I'm watching a movie, and I would hate to see my child get into it. I would rather take a vacation and not rent this movie. This movie is a movie about a lot of movies. I really hope the producers of this movie can come up with something new and original. I will not go see a movie where I'm having to spend my time, to say the least.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I liked about the old movie is the way the camera moves and the look of the movie. The look and feel of the new one is absolutely awful. The camera moves like a drunken man on the set. The lighting is so bad that it doesn't make any difference whether you're looking at the shadow or the lighting. This is the worst-looking movie I've ever seen on film. There's absolutely no reason to see this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my first review so you get used to seeing what's going on with this movie. I must admit, this is not a great film, as it was made in 1990, and I haven't seen every film that was made when it came out in 1969. There are many different films from the same period. I guess there are some people who like to see the old films and would prefer to see something that was very different.  There are also some good actors (Robert Stack, Robert De Niro, Ralph Meeker and Michael Caine, who were all very good in their respective roles), the same as those who made the original "Gangster's Gallery" (although De Nider and Stack had been in a similar movie back in '41), and I guess some of the same ones are being used here, who can be used for this film.  I had been told that the film would be about two men, because I heard about it on a few films and so the idea was that there might be some of these two guys, maybe playing a father and son type of roles). It's interesting to watch "K-9" (the 1971 film) where Stack and Meeker were in this movie, in which he has no scenes with them because of the way the film is edited and where Stack looks very good with them). And you see that the director saw them in the same role.   Also, you have to wonder if the "K9" actors were in the "Hollywood Gangster's" film because, if they were, it would probably be an absolutely different film. The "H" films had a great storyline for a gangster film and was made for the "G" format which, I guess, is the reason that this was made. So to see Stack in this film and see Meeker again on film is interesting. It was, of course, a great thrill to see him in "G-Man," the last time he was in a "H," although Stack looks older than Meeker. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was made in 1978. That's the year when the great war ended. It's very important to note that "the last war" was actually a very bad war in some ways. For example, when the Germans were in the trenches at the front, they would have had more contact with the Americans than the film actually shows.  This is the film that was actually made for Christmas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The two movies they make, The Killer Movie and The Killer's Wife, which are supposed to be identical, are supposed not to be, and that, the Killer Movie is almost the exact same thing as the Killer's Daughter, except for the cover.  And the Killer Wife, a true-crime story, was not a spoof or spoof-y thing at all, just like the Killer and Killer's Mother. This movie is a rip-off of both movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My advice would be don't rent it and watch it later, because you're going to hate it at some point. It's got the best actors (Kelsey Grammer, Scott Wilson, and Robert Stack) who will hopefully come and play their part, and it's a movie for kids, so I wouldn't have this movie. I'd just like you to know what you're getting yourself into. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are about 15 minutes of this film available in the video store. This movie was released in August, and I can't wait to rent it so that I can review it and try to find out why this movie was made. I mean, it was funny, and that was the movie I watched, with the actors in it. The plot is very predictable and boring. There are no laughs in it whatsoever. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I would say that it's the equivalent of watching a 60 minute movie, and even then, it's worth it for what it is worth to laugh with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never been to an "American" movie before, nor had I seen many other films at this point in my life (although I have been to a lot of American movies and liked them, I have not been exposed to many other movies in the past few years). This was a first-time film for me. I would like to say that I found this film to be a very mediocre film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do believe in the idea of "making a film" and the idea that film should be more than just a collection of my memories and the whole world. The whole reason why I made this movie is because I believed that if this movie would ever come out, that I would like to be able to actually remember my life. And after all, in the meantime this movie will go on to be shown in public theatres and be shown on video and then on DVD. After all, if they just release it without knowing anything about the actual content, then you're in for a really lousy film. The "documentary" style is all over this movie. I think the most interesting thing was the first film.    In "Killing Me Softly" a whole documentary style is shown of the actual killings, with some close up shots and interviews with the victims and relatives of the victims.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not exactly sure why this movie is called "Namco" since it was released in Japan on an original DVD, I've seen other movie from Namco that was very good. My hope is that I'm wrong. I've never seen this movie in a theater with the exception of a very good friend of mine who has an old theater that she'd rented it on that was probably going to rent it, who brought it home from her son's school in Brooklyn and gave it to me for Christmas. It had been made available on VHS for purchase at my local video store on a DVD. The box looked pretty good. It was the box that said it would have a "2 hour" or even a "4 hour" running time. That's what it was. I haven't seen the movie so I'm hoping that the actual movie is pretty good and I've left the theater with a small tip of my hat to "NAMCO". I'm going to have the local video shop put this out for the next day. It's very unfortunate that this movie was released because that is exactly why it should have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be frank with you, I have no idea how these two characters managed to overcome all their past lives.  The only thing I do know is that they both live in the same house, so the other two characters are probably doing it with their spouses. That would be much more fun, as would be for the first episode. And in the meantime, they're stuck together on a train.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to the movie's premiere with some friends and we all were in the same mood. This movie was awful. It was awful in every way possible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is all in the hands of the director, who is not at all experienced in making a film. He doesn't even have the luxury of hiring a few young friends (the kind of friends he made "Little Miss Mark" at the beginning of the movie). A few young actors with their backs to the audience at the theater (because they wanted to get a good review from a friend) watched the movie with their fellow actors (it was only their second or third performance, so they were very nervous).  There were several scenes in the film that were so difficult for the actors because they couldn't hear one another talking and they had to repeat their lines over and over.  I have seen this kind of film before. For me, it takes only a few minutes to understand the whole point of the film. The same thing goes for the script, which was so uninspiring that it is no wonder they were so desperate for the money. I cannot recommend the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Lawnmower" was about a real lawnmower, and "Gone With The Wind" was really a comedy about love.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched this movie it was supposed to be a film about "Mystery" and it was released in 2003 on the Showtime network, so it was 2001, my birth year. I guess there is no such thing as too much TV, I love Showtime and I like to watch everything Showtime has on it, so my opinion is my opinion, what ever it was.  I loved Mystery Science Theatre 3000 and there are several great episodes of that show, I watched several of them in this movie, especially the third season when they were doing a revival of the show on TBS. So I don't see why I would like to see any other Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes because it doesn't take itself seriously enough, which is the reason they are all on Tv, just like in the third episode of this movie. Also, the episode is completely and totally unbelievable. "Mysterious Science" is nothing more than a piece of fiction, with a plot that you can't believe. The whole movie is just a bunch of pointless drivel, with horrible acting and it doesn' t seem to get any better in the second half, at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I am not a big movie snob, or an ignoramus who thinks that a film with no special feature is a major or that this was a movie that only made money. Well, you would assume so. The only reason why this movie was on the schedule was because of the "A" category at the end of the year, and I am a big fan of the movie industry, and what they do. I thought they were supposed to be at least a comedy or an action or whatever, and they didn't even bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll tell you this: I'm a big fan of the show, and, I'd expect that it would come out on some kind of DVD, or DVD-based series in the future. I'm so, so disappointed that it's on Showtime, and that Showtime would actually air it as a Showtime show.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is another movie that has been remade before. It is a pretty low-budget movie. (It could be a movie made for $5 at the local video store). I don't really care, because the director's intent was to make this a film that will inspire, inspire others. So what I do know is that a great deal of research went into the making of this film. He was certainly very honest about his intention to have this film out on video. And he is just a few days away from finishing it. I would expect that if the movie had been released on DVD, he would have finished it, if not, and sent it to me. So that would be my first step toward buying a copy of this movie. I wouldn't have my movie on a video store video on VHS.) If he was able to make a better movie and not be the victim of some terrible imitator.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first movie (for people who want to see it).  This one is for people who are going to see a movie that is going to be a comedy, and will be one. There's a reason for it, to educate a few people who don't know anything about the movie, as well as to educate some people who know nothing about it. The problem is the fact that the movie was actually really pretty funny, a little bit about how funny it could be. They even got the cast in a comedy show, and that's where they showed some pretty funny parts of the movie: I mean, that's why it was called "comedy". And if the characters are really dumb (which they were, at first), or they're supposed to be just bad comedy (I mean, what was the point, really), that's the reason why the movie is called "The Best Movie Ever".  I just found out about this movie, and it was late the night when I decided to watch it (Saturday night). I have to admit that I'm still trying to make my way through it, and I hope I don't have to be honest with you on what I can do. That's why you'll have to make a good impression of this movie in one night, or the next day, or something. Otherwise, you have a greatbutbutbutBUT moviebutbutyet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must admit that I was somewhat entertained by "Hollywood" films about "Hip Hop" actors, such as "Hugh Jackman" and a number of "Dancing With the Stars" competitions.  And, the other day, I watched the "Dance With Me" competition, which is a dance competition of various "Hippie" and "Bobby" personalities, which had two female dancers and one male dancer. "HIP" and other "HOP" style dances are just not good for the public. The dance in "HIV" is simply a bunch of people dancing in a circle, without the slightest sense of style or skill. It's obvious that the producers of "HIVE" or "HIGHVIVE" were simply trying to do a parody of the hip hop genre, because the "Hive" is just an excuse to capitalize on what little there was of "hype" or money. I'm going to leave the "Lose Yourself" and similar films to my fellow "HORROR" films and go straight to the "IT" section of the "SHOCK" section, when "HIVES" comes to a close. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can understand the anger of the "others" who have their eyes on the stars, and they're angry at the Hollywood industry because they're just looking at "the stars" and not "Hollywood." The stars are not beautiful, the screen is dim and uninspiring, the camera angles are just horrible and unprofessional, and it is not the least bit entertaining. I'm not even sure if this is a comedy, drama or anything that I'm watching. I will say this - there's nothing whatsoever worth watching, even in the slightest. If you are a serious fan of a good movie, like I am, don't waste your time, not to mention that it will ruin your mood.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival on my birthday. I was expecting an art film to be shown and a film on human relationships to be about. It wasn't a film to watch in a movie theater. I could recommend it to be seen in an art or video art, but this is a horrible attempt at trying to make a film worthy of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third time I've watched the film, and I still can't figure out exactly what is going on here. What kind of a script is this? There are two main reasons. It's just boring. The second reason is that all of the characters are really, really dumb. I mean, what were the guys that were so cool and awesome at the beginning of the movie? In a world of post-apocalyptic movie, I really had high expectations for this. There are some really, great actors that made it's way onto the screen in some of the earlier movies, and there are some truly beautiful, awesome, or cool characters that have never been used to the same degree as these guys. That is probably why I'm such a big fan of those guys, and those guys who were used to this sort of movie, and these guys were so good at that genre. There's no doubt they're the most interesting guys to look at, and they deserve to do their best here, instead of some people in this movie doing what I would call a low-budget, low-end version of the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My girlfriend and I went to a movie at the movie theatre and we walked out. The movie was so terrible and they made the movie worse because they used the same actors. I mean, I'm not a super expert. I think they tried to make the movie about how they were playing a guy who had some kind of an accent.   I had to watch this movie and actually watch the movie to figure out how it was made. They are so terrible. They're bad actors, horrible actors. This movie should be an instant classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was made in 1978, about 10 years after a certain movie about a man named Albert Einstein.  The reason for that is that the movie has the same director and stars, in case of coincidence, as the first Einstein's movie, "The General Theory of Relativity", which was made, in 1939. And the only difference that the two men were very young at the time of making "Einstein on the Brain", was that the man in "The Theory of Special Relativity" was around 22 years old when the man who made "The Special Theory of Science" was 35 years old.  You may have to excuse me from the man-on-the-street interviews.  If you are a certain young man, I recommend this film, just for the novelty of seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the second film in the series, and its not a sequel at all!  It's the first film to use the original title of 'Lassie Come Home'.  I had a really good feeling about this film.  I remember the last one, and how my friends and I had really bonded over that one, since it was about a couple of the dogs, and it had been a lot of fun to watch the dog movie 'Dog Days', a documentary about all the dogs who were on a rescue mission.   As, and I really wanted to see the film to have another look at the dogs and find out how they were doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't been an alcoholic since i was 18, I have a pretty low tolerance for such movies, and I found this film to be not exactly sober, for starters, i just got home from work, and after the movie was over, i asked my roommate and fellow roommate if they really liked the movie, and both said that they had some drinks, and that they got into a "party atmosphere".  I have been known to watch the films that were "the whole gang" and "the kids", and I have gotten drunk when i was drunk, so i am not sure how anyone can get into the movie "The Gangster". The Gangster is a classic gangster film, which is obviously a little "loose" and has a little more of the 'club atmosphere', which is why i'm giving the movie the '3' from the '5' rating, for that film.  This film is a hard one for me to watch. The Gangsters were so cool and so awesome, and in this one, the only person that makes me smile is the very attractive Marlon Brando, which i thought was in the 'Gangster' film. But he isn't around enough here, it doesn't make me laugh, and it's more just an American film that was released on home video.  I'm sure there were many other aspects to this film that I haven�t discussed, and the music was very different, and if they released a European film with Marlon's image, I'm not sure what would happen to the film. Maybe a man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is a great film director and the plot is very good but there's a difference in acting from what it looked like at the beginning.  It's a real shame for the movie that it was made in a small town in France, since the director seems to have a few actors who've actually been to Paris. Maybe it's due to the fact that the film is supposed to be very serious (like "The Man in the Moon")   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is no secret that the writer-director had some involvement in this movie in terms of directing it. As much as I would like to say I have never actually been in a coma, it is no wonder I watch this movie now. The same director has directed two movies, which I remember being in complete control of in the past, and which I liked and enjoyed. In his "discovery" he chose to use a young woman for the lead of this movie, and then later used the same woman in the sequel (I know she's younger), with the same director (I would guess, not that it was really relevant to the point, since it's still a film about scientific discovery, etc.) because that seemed to be the only way he could find a girl, or a woman in that age to play a scientist, as a female scientist. If you want to read the whole review about this movie you will find that the whole film is about a male character going through puberty, and is really only about a few minutes long in the movie, so that's not a spoiler to say about the guy, because it didn't happen to me and my partner at the same time, and we don't really have any special interest in the subject matter anyway.  In my opinion this movie is a big disappointment, the only good thing about this is a new documentary, and one or two clips are not released, and I am not sure what they are about. Maybe in future there are things to talk about, but it was disappointing as a film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has been out since February, but it still looks like a typical film. The film will make it to New York, and the same actors who are in the first film will be working with the same cast as they did in the U. It's a straight adaptation of a straight play, a straight film from start to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As to the movie itself, it is an interesting film about how we need to be aware of how we are being misled about our food. It has a few things about how to eat for some who are dieters and it is not like a commercial or an advertisement.  My biggest problem with the movie is that it is so commercialized. Some people are like, "Well, it's like food", and they just need to digest that idea of food. For some, it may look like a food film or just a film about food. So they watch it just like a "food film" and think they are getting a taste of it and they get to see the food that they want to see in the film and then they just get so tired of it. It does seem to be quite long and there are only 15 minutes in the movie and it's just one film for the entire weekend long, so just that. This is the only reason I am giving this movie three out of five stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not someone who is into these weird movies. I saw this movie first and really wanted to like it (the ending credits were pretty good). I was kind of hoping it was going to be a movie about "The Secret Life of Albert Einstein" and then I think it was just too depressing for it to really be true to it. And that's only the ending credits. You have to look around the movie and find some truth in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this, I think it is safe to say that people do not look exactly like themselves and that is just plain sad. This film was released in the fall. The year is 2009, so there is not too much difference in appearance, which means that this film was a big hit at the MTV Awards in fall 2009, as well as several other film festivals, so it's worth getting a DVD with it's original US theatrical release and buying it just for the nostalgia value.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this movie hoping that it would be a comedy and that I could get a laugh or whatever, and that it was going to be released in theaters. I'm guessing that a lot of people went to see this film in theaters because of the great reviews out there, because it has the misfortune of being released to VHS.  This movie was released on DVD in 2004 and it was so bad. The DVD cover shows this movie in the summer and it's so bad in the fall and you really have no clue what happened to this. It's a total ripoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a movie about the great movie "Planet of the Apes" which was released in 1968. It is supposed to be about the latest version of "Planet Of The Apes", which is the original 1968 version.  It is hard to believe that these guys were the original producers. I recommend you rent the original, which I did, because of the incredible quality of the film, so if you do rent this film, you'll see what I mean. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of the late, great director Robert Altman, so I really hope that Altman can come through for me in this movie. If this movie is any indication, Altman was not available to direct this film. He could be seen on several other films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is pretty much what I would expect. The director of the film had previously made a film called 'Tough People' about an 'anti-Tough-person' (Tough Men) film. The film that was made about a man named Brad Pitt (I know Brad Pitt is a great actor) is about Brad Pitt, which is to say, about a guy. I, like many others, was excited to read about the film 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'. And, in my opinion, had the film ended up in the hands of the person who made 'Toug People' I'd be one of the first people to go out to see it. Brad Pitt and I are pretty good friends, and I feel he is a good actor, not just an actor.butbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbutthough the fact is that this film was made on the basis of "a man's point of view". It doesn't necessarily have to be a man's, and, indeed, one of his friends, Robert DeNiro, has a lot of time to sit in a studio and try to get his head around the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't about the life of a real person, a true hero will be shown. But until then, it's a sad and horrible movie. Don't watch it unless you love something, and even then, watch it with a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It could just be my perception, but as it stands, my movie is a total dud.  It isn't good enough to be shown on the silver screen. I can see it being shown to my friends who actually liked it. In my opinion, you get a 10/10 from the original, and I'm sure I got a chance to view it on the big screen. This movie was a total bore. The original movie had a great, and quite intense fight sequence, because the movie was so interesting and very well filmed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was going to get a funny, light hearted, "B" movie. My first viewing of the film was actually for friends at the Toronto International Film Festival, so I was familiar with the actors and had a sense that I was watching a movie that had a great cast, perhaps, and would make a great documentary. I have always been a fan of a film that is directed and written by David Lean, so it was difficult to watch a movie made in the way that it was.  In the film, they used the same story as they did in the book, which was about the love of the father for his son and how they are so close.  The film is told in the first-person point of view.  It is difficult to follow the plot or follow the characters, because it is filmed in such an amateurish way. In the beginning of the movie, it was just a lot of footage of a woman (with my husband) going to a wedding and going into a small shop, to give a general overview of the story.  I think the film is about 30 to 40 minutes long, and, I understand this film has been made for general audiences and not specifically for film students to watch, so my wife was also in it to "get more familiar with her role as a wife". They also show some of the characters in the shop before her, so the film could just be about these characters at this stage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really was a great movie. There was a song, a film with Kevin Spacey, a documentary about the history of film making with Stanley Tucci and so on.  This movie was based on the novel, and based on a TV series (the TV series had a great deal of creative freedom). I am not going to waste my time trying to figure out who the hell came up with the novel-based idea to adapt the novel and make a movie out of it. And, frankly, I don't have any idea how the director thought up the idea of adapting this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would love to see a young Paul on the screen. I would be really surprised that the makers of this movie would want to see me or my son (if the makers wanted to make a comedy movie) on the silver screen... I guess you can consider this to be a comedy... I would do best to keep an open mind and try to figure out what to expect, and even if it was possible, I would still rather have this movie as a horror film for some of the shock factor. A few days after it was released, I did not want to wait another few days for the shock of finding out what it was actually about... I have really liked Paul's work in several movies, including his turn as Captain Jonathan Daniels in "Buffy", and he is a master director... I know he can make you jump and go ballistic.  The guy should be in touch with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself constantly having to remember, and I am a woman who finds myself remembering men, I am finding myself remembering women. What was the point of doing this movie? It was not funny. I will say that I laughed quite a bit while I was watching "Dog Days Are Over", which is basically a rip off of this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with the three young boys from the beginning.  It seems that the kids from the previous two movies are getting their "back story", or the back story of the boys' parents. I'm sure I would have liked it to continue. I was very interested in the "three boys and their parents" or the boys.   I found out that they were older than the first two kids, and that the first kid had his story told in the first episode.  The kid from the "old man with the black beard" story. The movie opens with the oldest of the three boys, "Joe", his story begins in the second episode, and the other two kids are "Tommy". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very, very glad that I got to see "Babe" because there are so many similarities between them in terms of their looks. My heart was absolutely ripped out for the first few minutes of this film. It didn't take long to realise why the people on the IMDb page gave this film such an A score.  If I were to sit and watch this film again, the only movie that I would probably watch is "The Girl From Ipanema". I don't know about you, but in this one, it didn't go through the screening process. I would recommend you get this film as soon as possible. This is a sad piece of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have already been put on the spot by one of the other commenters on this site and a little bit more mature, so this movie should have had some kind of message.  The message in this movie, is an abysmal mess, so, it must be the worst movie ever made.  I felt cheated, and that is just not how a movie should be made. I gave myself permission to see this movie once, in the theater and then let it pass through the hands of some truly great actors who may have actually put in an hour or two. I didn't do anything to the end and I wish that I had. I really didn't like this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just an interview with Mr. Kowalchuk, who was the director of "The Grand Piano". A movie of this length was clearly filmed in the early 1980's, and as a result, it was the second movie in the series, titled "The Piano Concert" that was shown in 1977 (the first movie, with its much shorter length of 7 minutes). A movie is not the same as a TV movie, and the director didn't bother to put much thought into it. If you like it, it is not a bad film, as it contains excellent music. And I am sure Mr. Nachmanbutbutbut but I have to say that it was just my second movie. I don't really understand this movie in terms of how to make it an adult movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I write this review, I'm sitting at the computer, just sitting in a chair at the end of a cinema with a DVD player, having had my first viewing of this film in January.  I had no expectation, I had only one idea in my head, that this would be some great documentary about the life of a great musician, someone who had won the Pulitzer, or would be a really great film about a great band.  If you are a fan of the great music of the past, if you know the history of it, if like me, if it is "The Great American Songbook," you will want thisbutbutif not for "The American Song Book" - it's a pity, because it's about time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie ever made by any Hollywood studio. I mean the worst review I've ever had. This is just a really bad movie. It doesn't have any redeeming quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts out with a rather simple plot. It is about two friends that get into a fight after school and run into another one of the friends.   This is because it starts out a remake of the first movie. The movie is a remake with a different director and a different script. This is the movie that made it to theaters in Europe. It was released in the US because of Paramount and then re-released in theaters by Universal, which is why I just had it shown to friends in the UK and then rented it.  The story is basically a continuation of the last one in that it is about the same characters: one from the first and another from the last. We have all seen the end result of this movie. A guy named Mark Hamill, playing Luke and the guy with glasses named Tom Cruise, playing Jack. We know exactly what happened with those guys.  As for the rest, there are some minor changes (I'm not too familiar with the characters or what their circumstances are like) that don't ruin the film for those who liked the first one. So the original version had a guy that looks a bit like the one who gets killed by the robot in the end, and the same guy that turns up dead in the first part. Same with a couple of others. The guy who has a similar face to the one in the previous movie, and is dead. They both die in the same way, and it looks like they both died of something in the arms. This one is the guy that kills Luke, which looks to have changed his appearance a bit. He's got a scar over his forehead, and that's how the guy kills him, although it looks to be a very minor change. All in all, they all die very similar to how they were in the original. I think there are only 4 or 5 minor changes in the whole movie.  Some things I'd like to see changed are how the first guy dies, it's rather jarring, and so on and so forth.  It's not really important to us anymore, because I believe that people knew what was going on by the time we saw it, but it wasn't completely clear, and I think it would be important to explain what happened in the other ones.  Also, the character that shoots down Han Solo is a completely different guy, since he looks nothing like him.  I'm not sure why this one is different. I just think he

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is time for me to come out of retirement and get involved with the film, as it were. I did not feel the sense of the characters, or the sense that anyone was there. It's not just a matter of the poor script or bad sound, it's just plain bad. This is a movie that should have been made more like a western or a romantic comedy. It is not going to bring you any joy or enjoyment, and I would not recommend this movie to anyone with more than $5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "A" for all intents and purposes, I think the movie was titled "A's." I was looking for the movie "B" or "B-G", or the movie's subtitle.  I was only too happy to learn that it was directed by one of the great directors of the 20th century, John Ford, and that the movie is very interesting and has some good actors, but the movie starts to drag right from the very beginning.  There is no mystery that really gets solved by the movie being a movie with a detective, or that I think we can get by the way the detective character is portrayed in the movie.  The detective character doesn't really get caught up in the mystery, or his work, and doesn't have a great sense of character. The detective is a "detective" who is a detective from the book, and you can see how much of his work (like a crime lab) has been changed, and why. I don't want to say it was "lost in translation", because it doesn't seem that way.  My guess is that this "detectives" were actually trying to make a detective film, which is pretty serious, and didn't want him to behave as like he did, because he doesn't think a detective should be a "cop".  As for the detective, he's been around a long time, as the author's detective does, so he's familiar with his profession, so his detective, and his partner, do a good job with his work. We are shown a bit more of his personality. It's just like in the book; that's why he's being pursued by the police who are actually after him.  Maybe the movie will be better about this, and I'm sure the director will go back to it in a few years and see how he could change things up. He should make the film a bit like "A-G" and show the relationship between the detective and his "friend" as if they are working on a case together.   The "investigation" is about the detective "getting the case," and he gets to do this with a real mystery, and not just an empty case. And I think that this movie doesn't help the audience get to understand all the ins and outs of the world of the detective; I feel that it just sort of goes "full circle" and tells us what we already know, and the mystery comes

I thought that there was a connection there to be able to connect with someone.

I know that it is supposed to be a movie with all women, so I am going to watch the movie with the character looking the same as before, and that is a person that is completely different person. In short, if you were a Lola fan, I say go watch it, you won't enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were moments when it might have made sense that a low-budget movie might be what I was seeing, or what someone might be doing, to say this is an Oscar-quality movie at all is really disappointing to say the least, and the film doesn't make the best out of the movie. A good example of this is the scene in the restaurant where the waitress, when she tries to open the fridge, and is pushed back down the stairs and back into the kitchen. It's a pretty sweet scene where she's trying to open her favorite beer.  If you watch it as a comedy, I'd be willing to say she opens it.  There's also a scene when the guys come in with the girls, the waitress gets the girls in the diner.  It's not pretty. She's all cute and pretty, she looks very sexy, and her body is pretty attractive. So I'd like to see that, too, and if she is doing this film for a few minutes while the others are there, she is wearing nothing. If you've got to the diner in the meantime, watch her in a skimpy outfit.  She looks beautiful, and not all of the girls are slim or all thin and you see her pretty faces. The camera work in the hotel room scene is very bad.   She also gets into a hotel room and starts talking about how she wants to have sex with the guy.  I hope she gets into the hotel on the beach. She then goes into her hotel room without any pants on, and she has her bikini bottoms on, which I don't know what they were doing in the motel room.  The camera looks like it was made by a teenager and that's why it's so poor and the movie is really, really boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really loved what the guy at the end of "The Simpsons" did. We know they're funny guys. I found it interesting that they did a cartoon where they would go around New York. I'm a fan of that show.  A cartoon that came after this one was titled "The New Kids" or something like that and was really about "New Yorkers", i'm still waiting for that to come out, or, if it ever does, i'll probably still watch it. So, i found this to be a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, like "Pulse," is not meant to be a serious documentary. That is not to say that the people in the movie don't have some moral value. I was moved by a few interviews I did with people that had lost family members and a couple of the older folks in the community who had found their old neighbors. In fact, "The Pulse," one of my documentaries, was a real piece of work about a tragic event and "Pulsed" is another documentary about a sad event and, since the director (Tom Davis, of "Polaris" and "The Earthrise") felt the need to bring some "tough guys," it's unfortunate that he didn't have the guts to tell the whole story in this one. I mean, it's all about love and sadness, too, and the film is supposed to deal with this sad subject matter. If I can't believe that the filmmaker is really serious about this subject matter, then I guess the whole film is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After I saw this film, I felt compelled to ask my friend, "Who's the director?" I don't think I was even halfway into the film. Even though this movie isn't made for children, I thought I would give it a fair review because the first film was made for kids, and that was the movie I was watching it before, and this film has a much younger cast. It's like a children's movie, which makes you wonder what the adult's were thinking, as to the content of the movie. If you're going to pay $7, you're probably going to be bored. There was so much potential for a great, funny, tongue-in-cheek comedy like this. There are so many great moments that can be found in thisbut they're lost, lost, ruined, because this is a child's movie. The kid's act like they're making a horror movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, like all the others, was made in the "factory," just as were the other films in the series. The actors are all hired through a major agency (Nederlander) and they are the same as were employed in the previous movies.  I'd like to see a list of all the people who were in the first two films, so I could compare their performance with the other actors, because I suspect there's a fairly wide difference in the performances of the "bad guys" in this series. I'd also like to compare this series with the original three films. If you'd like a comparison, then watch the first three films (Avengers, Iron Man, Thor), and you'd be surprised to see how different their performances are.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of people who think of themselves as actors, and they're all trying to play the part of a movie-making legend. The idea of being in a movie is that it should be entertaining, and it should appeal to you, if you're a big fan of the actor(s). If you're trying to be one of the other people, it's a real challenge, and I don't think it would appeal to me at all, at least not for a minute.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I wanted to do this movie because I was looking for a movie to make after my divorce, after all, when I did my best at the trial, I was pretty successful at it, having to make a lot of videos of my trial and testimony, having watched a lot about it. Also, having read more about the case, my heart was in the trial. I was a victim of this crime. I wanted the film to make people believe that I was just another crazy man. That I was innocent of my crimes. I guess if you're not a crazy person or if you are a woman or gay person, you don't get to make that film. What this film does is it creates a negative impression of what actually happened.

The movie is not well edited, it looks good on the cover of a magazine or it was shot in grainy black and white, there is no way in this small budget of mine to produce a decent movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never read anything about this movie because I have been too involved in reading the book, because the movie was called "Prophecy," it seems that my wife is from the book and I am, or was, from the film. It is a miracle that the movie can exist. I'm so sorry to see it because this movie is awful, and I would like to take back what happened and do everything possible to keep my wife from seeing it. The script was very bad, but at the same time it was good enough to just keep a small history of the movie. I hope I don't have to see this again, I would recommend that you watch the movie before it has been released. The movie is so bad, and it is really embarrassing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a 70,000-acre ranch in Texas with a cattle herd that ranges from 300 to more than 3,000 and there is a good deal of controversy surrounding the ranch because it is managed by the Red River Rancher, a group of ranchers who have been trying to buy the ranch for many years. When we bought our ranch in 1980, we had a lease with the Red Ranchers and had been living in our own little ranch about 30 miles from where we bought it (which is now more or less where the ranch is located). If the ranch were located in the "old country," which is the state of New Mexico where the RedRanchers own the ranch, this film would have been about a Texas ranch and my daughter and I would be the protagonists. In this film, we're the heroes.butbutbutBUTbutbutyet. Mybutbutthough-that-the ranch is situated in the very heart of Texas, we are still about 60 miles away from where the film is being made, and our hero isn't the RedRiverRancher or the Texas ranchman, he's the Texas "public relations" guy who has to come all the way to Albuquerque (where the film was shot) to lobby the local officials, and who hasn't yet shown up to take us on the ride.  There's so much to be done with the story line and the ranch and I'm sure that I'll find out more when this film is finished, but just recently, I found out that the Texas movie had been finished and released for over two months before we purchased our ranch. The movie's opening scene (where I am now driving toward) is the first shot in the ranch. I had to walk across the highway to see the end of it and see the other end. It took about 40 minutes. This scene is shot on a 35 mm camera and when it's finally on the screen, you're in Albuquerque. We're about 60 minutes into the film! There are plenty of opportunities to show us the end-of-movie scene, showing the ranch on an expansive map, showing what the cattle are doing on the range.   What happens to the cattle, how they interact with other cattle, is never revealed. I can understand why they would want to hide the fact that the cattle have been at this ranch for some years and we should know more about it and their lives on the ranch (so I am sure

There's a point of it being "funny" because when Mr. Lasseter and Mr. Belushi played this show and I have to admit I think that Mr. Fox is in better shape than Mr. Cawley is, and I think it would make sense for Mr. Clampett to play Mr. "Lasseter" now, and play Mr, Fox. If you don't want to see Fox play Mr Lasset, that's fine and you could get a chance to see Mr. Flik. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm no stranger to films that are rated in the "9 to 10" range, it's quite common to find these films in the same theater that I found this movie, I rented it for $5. I was so confused that when I got off to do research about this film, I had a whole new set of questions that I needed answers to. It was a shame that I didn't give this movie away earlier, because I might have rented it in the theater, and then I could have enjoyed it more, and I'm quite sure that it's actually in my personal library. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is amateurish and the acting is worse than "The Sting".  I didn't know what to do... This movie was made for TV (but at least TV has had this kind of "bad movie", like "The Shield" or something), because I really didn't want to watch a bad one... I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good "movie" (which is "The Blue Lagoon"). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll have to say that at least one of the writers on this show was once friends with me, and he was a fairly famous writer, so perhaps he knew something about what I had to say about this, I have a feeling I know exactly what he wanted to say, and I believe he'd done something on TV that wasn't on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was not good at all. The actors did not understand what they were doing. I would like to say that I would love to have seen all these actors in their prime and to be in the movie with the greatest of all actors. I felt that they were given a chance to redeem themselves in this movie. The people were very nice and very good in the theater, but the movie ended on a really horrible note. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It didn't get into theaters, so people can't say they saw it or reviewed it. It also isn't really a complete story. It was all made in the beginning, when there wasn't as much of a problem with "discovery", but with the "big break" from the big one, the movie was made during this period when it was all about the big break. It's all about finding the big piece of the puzzle that the guy that's got the piece got, and how all these different pieces came into being. The movie wasn't made during the time period that it was supposed to be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a fairly good story, based on the life of the writer and the writer's friend. But it is difficult for the director to make it more palatable, with a lack of direction, and the ending seems very forced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I didn't watch the movie from the back cover or see the movie with other people. My opinion was formed during the week of the movie's release, and I don't think I was overly aggressive when making my comments, either. I think, based on all that I heard during a week's worth of interviews and from various sources, that I have a pretty good idea of the problems the film has. It's been shown on TV and in the movies, and so it was supposed to be an honest depiction of the issues, rather than a very political one, which makes this situation all the more difficult for me. My thoughts and opinion, in essence, are what the movie is about: and I hope the director and the producers don't have to do a lot of research into what their film is really about. I was extremely confused at the beginning of the film about who was a "victim" and who was "persecuted". I had no idea that the US Army was a political entity, and what had really happened in Iraq. The film tells us this, and we're supposed to believe that a political leader of the United States would have a complete grasp of the realities of what had actually happened. I don. The entire film is based on "truthiness", and I would rather see this movie a week or two from now. The truth is very messy and unclear.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's one of those dumb movies that you'll watch and go to the video store, and when it comes to this, the only thing I could call dumb would be stupidity. The acting is bad and the story is stupid. There is absolutely no story whatsoever. There are no character developments in this and this really ruined it for me, not even the most stupid part of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw a screening in Denver, which was the Denver film festival in 2010, and that film was about how the town was destroyed by the bomb that blew up the towers of the World Trade Center.

It doesn't look good. There's no doubt about that. It's like the film in the theater. I thought it looked really good when I saw it in the preview, I think they screened it at the Denver theater, but it was so much better on the big screen in Denver. I think, and maybe I just saw the Denver version, and they cut some spots in the back of the film to make it fit into the two-dimensional screen. There are lots of small things that are not too distracting, and the film still looks really good in black and white. It looks better on film. There might be some color, and there are a few shots of the "franchise" as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's true that some of the members have a connection with the show and that I did have one person ask to be a member at some point, I was told I was one of the "creative" group, which is a real thing-- and we're creative-- this show is basically a lot of people coming in and saying, "Hey, do you like to make movies?"  It does seem like people at the end of the day want to make this a more serious show. We've had some people on the show talking about making this show a comedy or something like that, but I can't imagine the people who are actually making this stuff do really care about what we, the actors, do. There was some really good people in this movie, some of them were still in it and even making it, but they would not say they were making this for us. I have a feeling that, after doing this movie for about two days, the people on-set of this show would be relieved they were doing something different. It seems that the creative group is very protective of the show, and for a show made-for-TV show that is kind of odd. I was really surprised. It would appear from the people at TBS that they are the reason we are in this situation. And it does seem that they would rather see this go through and through, and I am thankful they were there to talk to us-- because I think that's the best way to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think it's a bad film. I think it was just unlucky for some reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was reading a review about this movie, and I was very disappointed by it. It was pretty bad, and it wasn't a good movie. I saw it twice, and the third time I think I was so naive that I watched it with an audience, who are so smart that they knew exactly what was happening and what the situation was going to be like. So I didn't have a very good picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this? Some kind of movie? It is no wonder that the audience in France laughed and applauded so loudly in the cinema because of the stupidity that this movie is a joke. As I watched this movie, I saw French movies of a high quality. I also saw a bunch of English-language movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really is a horror flick. I found myself wondering whether or not it was an indie film or if it was a horror movie, and whether or the movie was made for kids. The only thing that really bothered me was that there were some scenes in which kids were running around with guns, guns, and guns. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I know it had been a very long time since the movie came out. In the meantime, I just kept asking myself, "what is the purpose of these scenes? Are we supposed to laugh at them?" I find it's better to look at a kid's face before making my own judgment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure it's pretty popular. And I love that the first movie was so funny and so "spy thriller".  If I liked that movie, I would watch the sequel, because my first impression of it was funny. It could have made fun of the characters and I could have found some of these characters. There's nothing to it. It's just like that, with me feeling insulted and like I just did something really dumb.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not surprised that there have been other reviewers. I'm sure some of the actors were really, really good.

I can't really understand why anyone would want to rent this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie "The Wizard of Oz" was released in 1939, but was about a female lead.  The film "The Three Amigos" is about a male lead, a Mexican-American (and therefore American-born) one. That makes sense. That's the way the Spanish language is spoken and that's the only way I could think of this movie being released in the Spanish speaking world.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the other movie this was a sequel to.  The premise of the film was the same as in "Hook."  Although it was never a direct sequel, the same person who directed Hook was directing the sequel. The first two movies were actually written by Robert Altman, with Altman's widow Ann Altman.   In the original Hook, the film takes place in a small town in Vermont. The film also shows the townspeople being killed by an unseen killer in the woods.  In this sequel Ann Altmauth (who directed the original movie) and Robert Altmann wrote the film with two different producers, Robert Altmauser and Ann Altmoorer. The killer is never shown on screen, never seen or mentioned. He is seen in this sequel walking down a dark street and murdering people in the very first scene, and is seen again several times during a montage of shots. The only clue we get about this killer is from a vague line in a news report about the killings which states he is the killer of an old lady, and that he has been found. It was the killer's blood that was discovered at the crime scene.  We see the killer being shot by a police officer on the news, and the killer reappears on the scene when a detective is being shot at by the killer and dies in an ambulance at the end of the movie.  That was very jarring to the audience to see the very beginning of the first movie where we were shown the murderer being found dead, in the hospital, and not see him again until the end. As a result, we had a lot of time to contemplate what we were doing and the film really only left you with a "what if" mentality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst horror films that I've ever seen, I mean, it's one of those movies you'd get in a local video store that I know about, because I had the chance to rent it, and I don't think you could even describe the feeling of it. And, really, I'd rather rent a bad horror movie that I can watch than rent this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "movie of the week" was that, I didn't realize how bad this movie was. It was so bad that you'd never even go near it. The only thing that kept me watching it was that I'd seen this movie before, and was hoping to get more familiar with it, and since I had seen the movie, I was expecting the director of the original to at least try to make the movie better, and in my eyes he did a very good job, because he knew exactly how to make a movie in a movie called "Beverly Hills Cop" that was not a horror film, I had even seen this one, so I was like "oh well, just a movie" or something like that. The ending had nothing to do with what was supposed to happen. Even the character was the exact same, same guy in this one and "Bobby Voorhees", and there was no real reason for him to be in it.   It was pretty shocking and really pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been about a month since it came out at the Toronto International Film Festival. The movie starts with the same actors who play the characters in the book, so you know the book is still being written.   And to make matters worse, the book was a very good and close study of the history of England. The producers of this movie don't seem to care one bit about the history or about the book's ending. The book was quite brilliant in telling how the characters would react to their own deaths in the end. The same thing happens in the movie,but they do not take any interest in it and the reason why was a bad and confusing ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems that the director had forgotten about the original film when he made this film, and apparently a lot of people are now saying that this is a'remake' of the film. Well, that was certainly my thought at first.  If someone had been to see this before I would have been more willing to go with that theory. Also, I am not really a big fan of this "old" version. If you're like me, you'd rather see the newer version, which is just a few minutes shorter than the original. I think that is just my opinion. I hope they make it available, but I think I'm going to see the new version before this one, since there has been a remake of 'Night of the Living Dead' available on DVD, which was released in the summer of 2001...  The director of this film is one of the most respected and respected filmmakers in the world. His films should have been released on DVD years ago, and I would be more than willing to wait to see his version of this one. I have no idea why the release date is now just a couple of months before the original one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I must admit that I'm from the South, having grown up around them, and I've watched most of the South-produced television and movie content for quite some time.  The first of the three "American" films was not so bad, as it was being made in England. That film was made about an entire army and was actually about a soldier on the march. The film "American Sniper" is being made about a sniper team with an average of 3 snipers per side (each member is supposed to take part in 5 to 10 missions). And let me make it clear- there's no way around this one, as the movie is not nearly as accurate as it should be and I do have to acknowledge that some of the stuff is missing from time to time. There are other inaccuracies as well, as I did not have access to a computer and couldn't check the film as closely as I would have liked to do.  This movie was released in 2001 and I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. I watched the movie on video and was quite impressed with the accuracy of the previous American films, as well as how well the American soldiers and the American military were portrayed in this film (butbutbut butbutbutBUTbutbut BUTbutbutButbutbutbecause I haven't had the opportunity to see the film again, I don't know how they did it in 2001).  I can only assume that this film is a sequel of sorts to "American Soldier", the first one, because they are essentially going for the same objective.   The film is not a true story, and isn't as realistic as the first movie. It's not just that, the film lacks the character development of the first film- there are many "spoilers" from the second movie and from the previous one that are thrown in your face at the beginning of the film. For example, I find it absolutely unbelievable that one of the characters in the second film could possibly have an interest in the love story of the character in the first (this was the case in the film "The Devil's Angels", which was a good film for those interested in the story- that character was a young and naive person). If you're a guy with a "real" love life, you'll find the most interesting character to begin the movie with- just in a "b" romantic comedy- and, in fact, the two guys do have a connection- the two of them

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's pretty obvious that this is not a documentary and it was made for the TV channel.  It didn't take a lot of time, which made it possible to have an hour or two to make this movie. In any case, I believe that if I ever get the opportunity to look at this movie, it will be at least five or six years from now, or maybe longer, since that's just how time works on this earth. In this movie it is pretty clear to me that it was all done with the goal of getting the film shown on the TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main reason why people watched this movie is because they were friends with each other on the show. This show is in black and white. This movie is black and in a movie theater. This is all I can say. This must have been painful for both men and women who had to endure this show for a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the film is that the Indian man, an old man who lives in the forest, marries a beautiful white woman, with the result that the old man goes away with his daughter, while the new wife keeps the child with her until she marries someone else.  This is a truly dreadful picture with an actor whose very eyes are red (when he speaks) because of the pain of the performance. It is beyond belief that it's worth a film at all. I was truly, truly dumbfounded when I saw the title of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the late great Ray Mears and the TV series, and it should be one of the few "preferred" viewing methods for this one. I am sure they could be made to do a TV series like this one, they did put a little "hitchhiker's" in the movie and I think they could also tell us a little more about the movie, or maybe I missed something when they started the whole thing off. When Ray Meeks died, they had an episode called "The Ray Macks Death Mystery".  The premise in "The Missing Ray Mores" is that the family is searching for Ray Mikes family tombstone.   They might want to take this movie off the air, if they think Ray Micks would want to hear this one in his final moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to the theatre last week after seeing a great review about this film, and I was thinking I would see a comedy in which I could actually say I had seen the first one. I think they have a list of actors who have done a lot of movies, and they all have experience on this kind of movie. I don't know what kind of quality we will see in this movie because they used a very bad director for a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friends and I all had a good laugh at how stupid "The Adventures of Dr. Zay" is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an interesting attempt to get me to fall in love with a killer, and was directed by James Belushi, who played the killer, along with Belushi's wife, Linda, and their daughter, Marjorie.   It doesn't matter what the director thinks, this movie was not well done. The director was extremely sloppy, and the editing was horrible. He tried to use his phone. He had to go to the store to get his phone back from a store owner. The film was extremely rushed and had nothing to show for the film. A few years later, there were countless of movies made about the movie, which are better. The movie was made by Belushi for a good reason. In the film, he was in the film for a year, and had a great story that could have been a masterpiece.  This movie was almost like it was a comedy, which wasn't good because there is a killer lurking around everywhere. Belushi was the star, so he should have been the director. After Belushi died, the director could use his energy and talents to make this film a masterpiece, just like in The Last House On The Left. It was a horror movie in the beginning, and that's the film in the United States, not this. It's time for this movie to come out of the country and back into the US, since it's getting released in Japan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple days ago I watched this movie, and while I was in the movie, I had a feeling that it was going to be a very good film, and it didn't let me down.butbutbutbecause of the bad situation at the beginning of the movie. I don't know if it was a lack of knowledge of what happened in the '60s, or just bad timing with the'real' '60's 'Ace'. My advice is avoid this movie and buy a copy of 'The Man in the Moon', a very funny 'Moon Man' spoof film, instead. And if you like a'man in the moon' spoof, I strongly recommend that you do NOT rent this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a comedy (if you can call it that) on "The Tonight Show" with a bunch of kids, and then when it came out on "TBS" it was supposed to be a family show.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, we find out that a character named "George" is responsible for writing the book in which our protagonist comes into existence. As the movie progresses, we learn that "George"'s character has a history of mental disorders. Some of the film is so vague that you could take it at face value. If you were looking for a plot summary, I think you'd find it here, as the movie is just a collection of anecdotes and stories from the book. I don't want this to be a review of this movie: I feel I should warn the people I am writing this review about the possibility of this sort of movie becoming a cult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, the main character is very good at doing his own voice work, and he is doing a TV special in Canada called the Movie Show, and there is a scene where he's doing that now.  When we did the original movie, it was actually filmed in front of a mirror (since it was supposed to be the only movie in existence). We also have to keep in mind the fact that this movie was made before the "Lawyers and Judges" show had come on the air, so it has to be viewed as a true sequel to the original. There is only one exception to this rule, and that is the scene where Mr. Pecker is playing golf on the beach that appears in the episode "The Law and Judges", since it was filmed on the other side of the hotel.  In that case, I am thinking that there was actually one scene that was supposed be in the beach where the lawyers and judges golf club scene, which happened to be one of the closest locations to the hotel where they were golfing (the one that is still in the hotel when the beach scene is set).  As a result, it's a rather odd golf scene, and one that would have been more fitting for the "Mr. Peckers" show since it's not on the show, but since it isn't on the movie, I'm afraid that it'll never appear in the movie. What's even more odd is that in that scene, the hotel door is open! And if it's on the book, it would've been opened and Mr. Witherspoon would've just said, "WOW!" on that one scene.  And so, when the lawyers are doing their first scene in the original film, they enter the door on their right side, and it opens to the right side of them, but that's the one scene where it opens from the opposite side.  We know that the door's on Mr. Hawn's side, so that's another scene that opens to his right, and they walk in.  Now, Mr. Hank looks right at the door and says something along the lines of "Hello," while Mr. White looks right and says, "How do you do?" So if we're looking for that odd golf game scene, Mr Hawn says, and we can imagine him, "Hello." Mr. Pidgeon says, instead, "Hi!" And we can see from the back that the window

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems that it was just my film that I found out about and was just going to watch and compare it to other movies that were out at the same time. It appears that every movie has the same actors in the same roles, and they are probably trying to avoid embarrassment.  I guess they thought I would like to compare to all of the other movies, because they think that I would be a crazy person, as it is not fun or educational. The movie is too long and boring, and if you really want to see an educational film that has all the other films in it, go to the other kids' films, or the other adult films. This is a movie that you have to force yourself to watch. If you were to find a kid's film in the bargain bins, then I would recommend that you rent this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to look at this movie, and I'd like to say that I liked to see the first one, as a lot of kids in the theatre, and the whole film of "L.I.E.Z."  I think that it's pretty obvious to anyone who has watched it before that it was a huge mistake to have made the film available. In fact, I have the first film on VHS, and if the film has not been taken care of, it would have been pretty good movie. I'm willing to forgive a film about a kid and his friends, who just spent a day in town, or who's parents did not want to have their child come home to the house (with all its family members) for a few minutes, which was very sad... I really wish they had given that film a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very poorly made attempt to film the original Star Wars trilogy, with very bad special effects, horrible special effects and terrible direction.  I am not a huge fan of Lucas, but I have nothing but respect for him and have enjoyed some of his films, for example, American Graffiti and American Grafitti, and I am sure that even with this, the film would not be worth even a watch. I think that this movie is about the same time, about 10 years ago.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the first movie, and I was looking forward to see this one on the video store shelf. I thought I was going to be watching a horror film about a serial killer who would come in and kill people off.  I'm still in the middle of it. I didn't want to watch this for my wife, I think she's a really good actress. She's had great roles in her TV show, she doesn't need this movie. And it's too long. They are talking about this movie being the ultimate thriller. It's like a 90 minute movie. It sucks and it was really stupid and totally predictable.

I don't know if I'm getting old or whatever, I have watched a few comedy DVD's since age 10 or something. I really don't think this is worth rental, it's like another movie in a bad taste. It has a bad special, and the DVD has a really bad cover that resembles the bad cover of a terrible movie. You can tell by the look of the movie that it's really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a very slow paced film with two kids who look more like they're trying to act with what they're doing. I've seen other films like this that were far more violent, they are just like "real" life. The other kid was very funny, that kid was an 8-year-old and he probably had a very small role in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of the original, so I'm used to being able to follow the story. I would probably not have cared as much about this particular story had I heard it was to be based in the Middle East, as I have friends in the region. And I can't say that because of my knowledge of the region, nor is the fact that I'm not a Muslim that I know some of the people involved. I'm only a fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really, really bad, and I mean really bad. The film is just as bad as this horrible piece of junk that I saw it in. A big shocker. If you're a movie buff, this is just like a bad-taste film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to give any more of my time to this movie because it's horrible. I can't believe this was an R-rated movie. If you're a movie buff, you have a certain image of an actor like a man who is in good shape, or at least was very handsome. You could say, like you're used to, that you've been to a lot of movies, or watch a lot, watch another, see what you think about it, and see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to say this is a bad film. As is so often in my films. I was really surprised by myself. The reviews were wrong. I knew this film had such great people who would come back in some way.  Maybe the people watching this film didn't get the whole picture. That's OK. In that case, the only real conclusion I can come up with is that this movie, despite being in "the festival circuit," will probably be in stores. We will find it on VHS format and if you are a fan of the film's score, go watch it on DVD. I thought it was amazingbutbutbutBUTbutbutyetbutbuttoobutbutto bebuttobutbutthatbutbutbecausebutbutsobutbutthefilm's score was so good but was too compressed and compressed in this version. It was really disappointing. I'll have to talk to the cast about the "scoring" and "music" of the score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen more of this than any other movie in the past, and am well aware of it.  There are good and thoughtful people in thisbutbutI'm afraid that this is a "no-win" situation, especially because the two-part "Giant Rock" piece that precedes the "Truck" piece. The Rock piece is not just a rock piece and was used extensively in the production of Giant Rock and is not quite as fragile, it's much wider and much flatter, allowing you to walk on the Rock in its entirety, whereas in the Truck, the Rock is too narrow and too short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a low budget film, which was intended to get attention. I thought it would be a lot of fun to write. There was no surprise when I saw the film because it wasn't written in a good fashion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that it's not the biggest film ever, nor the one with the biggest budget. That may be the case. I don't know what the heck happened to this little movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the fact that this film is a little bit like the classic "Gone With the Wind". When I was in high school, we were given that same film as well as the radio and this is my opinion that it's in bad taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people who have seen this movie know me and my other films and know that I am serious about this film, so I would recommend that if you are a fan of the films that you see this one. Ibut that is a very bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, I'm a real fan of James Coburn's "Mr. Big" and everything else he's been in, even if he did become a really good actor, this film is not so good. I mean it's not like this film will do nothing and get the same score from other critics. It's hard to believe this movie got a 10 rating from the Chicago Sun-Times, the Los Angeles Times or the New York Times. I've read reviews of it in the trade, so I'm sure it would still be pretty good in trade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is set at a boarding school. As I know boarding schools, I know the classes are very small. If any of you know about boarding schools know that the classes were at least 20 people at one of the schools in this story. That means that the students were in school for 90 hours.  I know that they were in the midst of a great struggle to fight for their liberation (and I have heard that they fought to the death in the war). And when I think about it, I think that they are in fact, heroes in this but they were still in school during their time in the liberation struggle of their fellow students, and I didn't like that we were fighting for a liberation from school. I thought that the "liberation" should have been from our time in prison (as I understand it) so that we should have all been released right after we had won the war. There is nothing about our time being a form of liberation. I am sure that the principal had his reasons and I am not trying to bash him in anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My favorite actor, Howard Korder (who played the "Kriff," a lovable little man who lived in Kriff Township in the 1950's, and went through life with a loving attitude about everyone, especially kids, is now trapped in this "Coffin Hill" movie, an old wooden coffin, locked by a large, fat, bearded man in a white robe, walking down the aisle and with a red beard, with a yellow hat.  That is the man in the old movie, and in this film, you can find him in the new church, standing in the back of the church at the altar of St. John's, with the sign of the cross, holding a pew in front of him, and sitting in the pew next to the choir director, singing the wrong hymn and reading the wrong book of Scripture, with my heart pounding in disbelief and utter sadness. That is my story right now... and I'm not alone in it. I'm sorry for you Howard, my thoughts are with you. My prayers are with all of the other filmmakers who made this horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the idea of making a movie about an event that happened in the 20's and 30's (this was about a "war of the worlds" that's more accurate).  It was supposed to be "Rent or Own".  I was very excited to see this and read the script. It had a "good story" about a good cast (who I've just seen on the TV series).  Now it's on the screen. The film has very little to do with the plot. A couple of good actors like Ed Harris and the other actors from the TV show did a very good job with their respective roles. And the music did a good job complementing the scenes.  The story has no real "arc", and it's not that the film is about the movie's "quality", since the film's opening and ending, at the end of the day, are very different than what's in the novel.  I don't remember when it was that a lot of writers started off with the novel and ended up making a film. Some of them made great movies and some of them even made great books.   A few of us from the book have commented on it, so I won't go into it here, because, as I stated above, there was no conflict between the characters (no one has done an act of good). The main character is a "bad man", a killer who's trying to kill his wife.  This guy, in this movie, is a bad man, a killer. He wants to kill the daughter of his wife's friend and daughter's best friend. In the novel, the father and the wife have just spent a good time talking about a love triangle, and then the killer decides to murder his wife, daughter and best friend's best friends' daughter.  A good example would be from the movie is when the father leaves his wife and goes and tries to talk with his daughter about going to the hospital. The scene is about how much the man wants his wife to die and the scene ends with her in a bed and his wife looking at her mother with a smile, so as to say, he's about to shoot her.  And that's what happens in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have the best of intentions for the director and the end result is that there is an endowment for a film called "Carnival of Souls"   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie like this needs to be on the silver screen, and the reason why I gave it a chance is because it was made on a student's level, not in the 70's or 80's. I have no idea what the hell that director and the other actor are doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For a comedy movie, this is the kind of movie that is best if you are on the bus, at a diner, or at a strip club.   The other night, a friend and I were watching it at the same time with another friend of ours. We were laughing hysterically about it's ridiculousness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see a lot of movies in the theater before this one.  The opening credits of the movie were in the movie, so that is a good indicator as to what is in the "special" section of the theater. The director chose to start the movie in a small little hotel room, instead of the usual big city hotel (in this case) because of his own reasons. I am not sure what the purpose was.  This movie's main character is an "ordinary guy" so the whole concept of "normal" was just kind of thrown into the movie (that is the whole premise of the entire movie). So, when they showed me the movie at the local theater and it was shown to me for the entire three hours I was there, I kind of thought that maybe it would be at least a couple of hours before they came out with the DVD, and then when they did, I knew it was only a matter of minutes and the DVD had just come out in the afternoon. It turns out that I had been watching it for over two hours and that's the only reason I even knew what had been going on in this film until I finished it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For starters, the first one was a really good romantic comedy (think "Shakespeare in Love"). The idea was that a girl and a boy would fall in love and marry each other and have kids and get married, not in love. The ending of that movie was really depressing. The movie itself is too long, boring and horrible. The plot is not good. It is not funny. It's all about romance and not all love.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I was the typical "O'Connors Fan," which is the most common type of film in Hollywood. As such, I'd be a little surprised.  To quote my friend in "The Big Red One", I was a true fan of "OConnors". Second, this film is about Gene Hackman's character, and I think that his character is one of the most interesting in recent memorybut unfortunately, it has been made into a movie before, with his character dying in "Clear and Present Danger", a true American tragedy of the Vietnam War.  Gene Hackford is, without a doubt, the greatest actor who ever lived in the movie world, and his character has been createdbut not been released for over ten years and only for "Clear of Sinners" because of the death of his character in "Halloween". There are several scenes, including the "Clear", where he is dying on the "Haddonfield" set. This scene will never be shot for another reason. I'm not even sure that I'd make the film a "G" film for a second attempt.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so terrible. There were no real good reasons for anyone to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has been years since I saw it, I guess the first one didn't have the "sensitivity" of today's remake. I don't think it's just me, this is the only movie I've ever seen that's been released in the USA that's had it released in Britain that had it on VHS. They have released dozens of other movies in England that have just been released on video. The British DVD is from the American distributor, and it's a "film" with English subtitles, not a "VHS". They've got to know their audience and have done it for years. The English version of this movie has been banned for over a dozen years, and the original movie was banned in England for six years after it was first released. This is the first time that's happened. That is sad, and unfortunate, I'm sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a totally different movie. My first impression of this movie was that I was watching an anthology of short stories, and the only thing that I knew was that it was about horror.  I'm still going to watch an anthology because it still will be about a bunch of stories about scary people, and people who are supposed to be scary, like 'The Ring' and 'Scary Movie' are scary, but I don't know why they would make a movie based on what I think was the premise. It was a completely different movie, that made no sense.  The 'twisted' ending was the worst version of 'The Sixth Sense', I think I can safely say that it is completely different from the other movies in it's own movie! I am seriously, really, angry with the way this movie turned out, so if you are looking for a movie that you actually want to watch and get the most out of, go get this one and watch it for your own sake, because that was another movie where this movie did exactly the same thing to that one. I wouldn't recommend you waste your time or money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a shame that it should come on TV, because the reason for making it was to get the public to see this movie, which they saw it. I did get to meet some of the actors involved in this, and they all gave some great performances but this one is so bad I can't recommend it at all, and unless you have a very high opinion of this movie I would not waste your time with this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that the movie might have been better than this: it might have had an actor who was from Mexico. But it has been put out by the usual Hollywood distributor.  The movie will be on VHS with a DVD release. That means you have to rent it. You will be disappointed. The actors are good. They are decent. They aren't over-acting. The special effects are also very good and I wish that there were some more of them. It's just the film as a whole is bad because you get a couple of shots at the beginning of it and in one or two scenes. You can watch it in its true Italian translation that's so you get an idea of the Italian culture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the video that had been cut from the theatrical release of this movie. That's one big reason that I saw this movie, and it was the reason that my friends and I agreed to watch it.  I did a little research on the film that was being shown at the Toronto Film Festival, which was also advertised here at the video store. They showed the same movie that I did, they were shown as the "Reverse Polanski" film.    That's why I'm so bothered by the fact that they'd just cut one of the big actors and their face was all black and their teeth were so white! We're talking about the most famous of all Polish horror filmmakers, and that means it would be a major Hollywood film, and one that I could imagine people paying to see.  The movie doesn't look like a major studio production, it looks like something from the 50s, the 70s, even 90s, which is really not that great, though still not bad. The film is also not that well-made and a poor example of how to present horror stories; for example, in one scene (the one in which an old man comes to the house) there's a black man with a headband, or something about a man in a black headband with a white face, or what they were selling it as a "B" film, or in the "cinematic horror" sense of the word, it's just really horrible. The most important thing to consider here is the quality of your taste and your taste for film-making (and to make sense of it all, watch this movie with subtitles) because the film is nothing like the "Black Rose" or the "White Rose", which are probably the best horror films that have come out, and so you'd be surprised to see it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how many hours have passed, but for anyone that really sat down to do research, I'd be shocked at the number of "experts" that actually sat through this and actually made the judgment call on what they were about to watch. My own opinion is that it is a very amateurish "documentary" with a few amateurish actors. I think it is just as silly as the people who really were making "Bend It Like Beckham". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, this is the most ridiculous movie ever made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's really no excuse for it. As a viewer, I felt disoriented, confused, and bored the whole way through. The scene at the beach with a naked man in the foreground, and the naked guy in the background were both completely inappropriate and completely unnecessary.  The entire scene with the guys in their underwear was completely absurd and completely unbelievable and unnecessary. In this movie, the guy was standing naked in the middle of a beach.  I mean, it makes no sense whatsoever. The director of this film, I think he's got some sort of weird idea about the whole thing, he's a realist who's going to come in his day clothes. There's a lot of nudity in the film, which is a pretty normal type of film, so people in the next world are probably going to be very disturbed by this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was released in 1970, so in my opinion it was probably a little overrated. I have seen a lot of overrated, overrated movies. One can only hope that someone else, like Robert Altman, may review the movie. The movie, which was directed by the great Paul Morris, begins in a pretty good, low-key fashion, with Morris saying, "My name is Paul Morris," and playing the role of a man who is a student at the U. Of course, this movie was made in the late '40s, so its subject matter is really low. Even when Morris does a quick, off-camera interview in which he is in an office wearing a suit, he is still the main character, and only has a supporting role as an art student (with the student artist, a young woman, as a roommate). Also, in the end of the film, Morris is alone on an island with no girlfriend or lover, and no other character has the character of an ideal romantic lead.  The movie begins with a man and woman (a young woman and man) falling in love, and ending with a woman and woman. One would think that the movie would be all about "making up for lost time," and how the characters would become involved in a typical love affair. The whole movie is about the other people of the island (i.e. the art students and the female student and the male student).  This could be a totally ridiculous movie about people of a different race or class doing some sort of love story with people of another race and class or class. Perhaps the only really "romantic" part of the movie is when the two lovers are standing on the beach. That scene is supposed to be romantic, and the two of them are standing in front of a white sand beach. I mean, they are standing right next to a white beach! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What could possibly be the worst thing in the world for me is now. The movie looks like a pretty good film (with a few nice people, like the main protagonist) with a lot of great actors and some good story lines. That's what I'll give the movie. I'm just not sure what happened after the screening (if it was just a screening I have no idea of who was watching it, but I'll guess it was a screening of the film that's on DVD, for instance, which is probably from another country). I think it would be nice to have a little more information about what happens when one is in the hospital, such as, what medications are taken, what the exact dates of the hospitalizations are, what are the medical problems that I have, etc.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on a Friday afternoon in the middle of July, after a long walk back home. I'd say the first 15 minutes were just as I was expecting, with a good looking movie, with actors who were at least not horrible in their careers. After those 15 minutes I had a hard time following the plot and wasn't impressed by the actors. It's true that this is a movie with a bunch of kids, I had my wife watch this, she said that she didn't like any of them because she was a teen when she was in high school, and this is one of the kids' first movies. In the second movie, they played the movie as a "high school movie" and I'd be shocked if they weren't the same or even worse!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is in the vein of "Dance of the Dead," and there is no dance of the dead.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think there are some really interesting reasons for why this movie was made, for example. For one thing, it has some "drama" (which was filmed in it's early days). This was also the first movie in this franchise, so it's understandable that it's not the same with all that is around it.  It's a "film noir". I haven't been able to find anything called "noir" in the dictionary, so I didn't even know that that word was available.

This was the very first thing that I rented and I don't believe it was intended to be released to theaters, and I couldn't see anything that I'd call "art". I've heard people say that some of the people who I'd interviewed about this movie did well in the interview. I couldn' even see them at all in this film. It was so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two reasons why it is that I don't think they are related. The first is, of course, the obvious: that it is a movie made by people who have no knowledge of this subject area, or else they have no desire to make the movie. The second reason is that it was made by someone who was paid to make a movie, which was the case with the film of "The Man from Earth." It is not my first time at this kind of movie. It is also my second time making it, and that is one reason I chose to go into the film industry (having just done it as a writer in the early '80s). I was still very young, and I was hoping to make films which were of a similar nature, in the same genre. The man from earth did not try to make movies, and even if he had, they still would be about the human condition.

I would like to say that my opinion of this film is that it is a satire of various movies and I guess it is to show the difference between what movies are really about, what movies can really be seen from the inside out, how the public perceives movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not exactly complaining about any movie. I don't mean to bash the people at this movie. As you might have heard, it's a comedy about a comedy (no pun intended). There's not a great track record for this genre. This was a major disappointment, with terrible acting, a bad story, terrible writing, and an absolutely dreadful track. It was almost unbearable and was painful to watch. If I could make it any worse than that, it would probably be painful to sit through. It is a terrible piece of work, and as such is no wonder why it is so terrible. This is a really bad movie, a "G" movie with the worst film title ever made, and one must not waste one second of your time on it. If you are not really sure about the film's subject matter, do not waste your money on this movie, and I can't even imagine how it can win an award. I'm sorry.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a "film," not a documentary. A small portion of the footage from the film was played in an episode of the BBC series "The Beatles: The Early Years." And while we all know that the BBC is a big international corporation with an international presence (it is the most watched English language broadcaster and has a sizable international audience), it still made me sad that my own personal favorite band would be featured in this film, a film that will most likely end up in a video store as a VHS.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie that made it to the U. It's hard to figure out how it's even possible to see. I felt so ashamed for myself. I went into the movie expecting it to be some silly, cheap, stupid, cheesy horror movie, just like the previews I went in expecting to be scared. I think I'm in the minority, and I think this movie needs to be pulled from the shelves, or at least a DVD release of this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is funny to read some of the reviews. It was quite entertaining to read as a novel. If I hadn't known better, I would have laughed along with anyone.

It goes from one of the families to another in an unbelievable and unfunny attempt of the sequel. As a result, this movie is far from funny, nor funny enough to be a family film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know you don't see me in the theater.  I understand why. It's a movie about a guy who was on the track team, and how many people go to college, and have a family to support. We do want to know what it's like to race on the tracks. You don't get that in this movie. It isn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What should have been a wonderful film, one with a great cast, a superb script and wonderful production values, I was floored by the film. Not the actors were good, not the sound was good, the camera did not capture the beauty of nature and I did not appreciate how they were portraying nature. How they had the time to make a film about a small town (or anywhere) and spend three hours filming at this location would have been an incredibly difficult task. What they were trying to portray was a huge, sprawling area that, to me, reminded me of a nature film.  There's so much in that area that we're only a few hours away from the mountain top. It's just not really natural and it's really not what this film was supposed to be. The film is so far from being finished and I found the end end to be incredibly unsatisfying. I'm just a girl with a few bucks and my budget is so small that I have to admit I would rather spend this money on a better movie. If you're willing to make an investment in it I'd recommend this movie as I have nothing but the highest respect for the actors who were actually in this one. You don't really get to see it because it is already completely out and a lot of the money and time is already gone by the time I shot it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had read that the playwright, Arthur Miller, had a great relationship with his playwrights. It turns out, this movie was about the playwright and his love for itbut not the play. The playwrIGHT was at his best in his play on "The Crucible". His portrayal of the Crucible was based on his life and his memories. The story of The Crucible had been set in "Clerks of the Twentieth Century". This play is more like a script for a play based on Miller's thoughts or ideas, like a movie based on the play, rather than on the real life events he was talking about. It seems the play was written by an old woman who is trying to recreate her great, 20th century play on Miller, because it is so old that it doesn't seem to fit the real Miller's vision of "The End of the Trail".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what the future holds for this project, as this movie was the first film to go into production.  I guess we can consider this the "first movie" in the sense of not making the film more expensive, as it was $100 at the time of production. I really hope that this doesn't get shelved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After seeing the first two reviews, and the good reviews I'd gotten from friends, I was hoping to see a new movie from a friend, or to see something new. I saw this on DVD, and just about every movie has a different cover, and maybe it's because I didn't get the movie to the local video store, or the video store didn't have it, I thought it was kind of a cool thing that they had something new, to add to the collection. I was expecting a movie with one cover. I had been promised that this was some "funny" movie about a gay movie, or some kind of comedy. I hadn't even seen the last one, so I guess I didn 'think'. I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care what it is about the first one, the third film, starring Bruce Willis, has just been released in stores, on the big screen, in the states. And I'll be honest, if I were Bruce Willis or another actor involved, I'd want it for the third time out, because I'm really looking for something else. The third film is not a good movie, it sucks, bad, and boring. The characters are stupid, they're stupid, and their acting is atrocious. And there's just no redeeming aspect to the movie. If you ever wanted to see a Bruce Willis flick with the "Man of Steel" tag, watch it now, and then watch it again. Bruce Willis' "Man" is a superhero with all of his superpowers and gadgets. He doesn't have an explanation for why the man in Man of Steel had to die. And, if you thought "Man Of Steel" was about Superman's love of Lois Lane, you'll get some kind of explanation for Superman's "Man". Bruce Willis wants his hero to be an ordinary man who's got a boring life story and he needs to come off of it like an American hero. In the end, he is a loser, and it doesn't make me, as a fan of this superhero, think that he's a hero, or believe that the world would be a better place if he was in a better state of mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people think that this movie is so funny. That's not it. The first 30 minutes of the movie are at least funny, it's just funny, that's me doing my best impression of Kevin.  In fact, I don't think that Kevin can really pull off the comedy part, the part that goes right to his character. You get a lot of funny lines from the part of him that's on the show. It's a good scene that goes on. And a lot people will say that he's a funny actor, well, there is an opportunity there. So, I would recommend this movie to people who are into serious comedies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the TV series, and have been a season-ticket member for six years, even though I haven't seen the show at all, I've seen the movie, and I found it to bebutbutbutratherbutch and unconvincing at best. To say that it was the worst movie I've ever seen is an understatement, I felt it was a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a theater in Hollywood, on the same weekend as some of the best films of 2006.  The idea behind this movie is to find "The lost man of the East" in some remote, undeveloped area, somewhere in the United States. I hope I'm wrong, because this movie really had me hoping that it would at least show me where it was on a map, because at least some of these "lost man" stories were in the original source. In any event, I'm surprised that this movie could be shown on video, and this is not the last time this is true. There was one movie in 2001 called The Lost Man of the West. I won't go into that movie; I would recommend people who like this movie to buy a DVD player and rent, not rent it, because you can find this movie on TV. I recommend people avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first of a series of movies.  If I had one, I would have to pay a lot more attention to this movie than I've been able to do in my short-term review. It's not just because there are no special effects, no "special" actors, or that it's only in black and white, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a small part in the end of a great film. I thought it would be like the end credits of "The Black Cat" or something like that.  The cast was mostly made up of white people and of white actors (for the most part) with the exception of two black actors (one played by Anthony Hopkins, another by Anthony Quinn), a woman played by Bessie Love, and a woman (a waitress by the way) played by a black woman, and both actresses. This is not a movie that I really wanted to see and I gave it a 4/10 just in general. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been almost 30 years since I saw this movie, and I must confess, after being exposed to the trailer, I did feel better about having seen this movie.  But still, it is still just a film, and one would certainly want to see it in order to learn more about it's subject. The only way to do so, is to go to the real thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The actors in the movie are pretty good, and I can't say they are not talented.  I love a good comedy. It seems that when it was first released, the movie had such a short, stupid ending that I did not know why the movie was so short (it was in the video).  The movie starts in a "normal" location (i.e., Hollywood) and then moves through a series of locations in LA. I'm guessing that it was meant to do so. It also doesn't give any kind of idea how many people work there or how many employees are in the building. It's just too vague and I don't see the "fun" of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many characters in this movie, but the problem is that they are all the same. There are no two characters who are the same, and the first one that I saw didn't have to deal with any of the others' problems in the beginning, and in this sequel, they're all in the same boat. All of them are trying to deal, and they all need to deal. They're all different in different ways, and that's the whole problem.  It's hard for them to make sense out of the film, and it's a pity that they wasted two hours on a movie that should have ended in about 2. There is a girl in it who's the only real character in it that's in the real world.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For those of you who know what they are doing, know what is right and know what to do, you get into this movie. It isn't that great, but it's not terrible. It's not like the great disaster disaster that the makers of "Deadlands" made in 1996 that was so bad. That's what "Deadland" is, a film made in 1997.  There is no great disaster happening.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One reason for the film's popularity is the fact that it was the last installment in the series.  When this film was released, it was already out on DVD.  The DVD is currently available on DVD-A.  I am not sure why it would be the only reason for anyone to rent this movie, or why it is such a huge hit.  This film is only a sequel to the previous one. The only reason I can think of that would make it different is to create more of a sequel, such as a "Lost" sequel or something like "The Lost World."  The movie is still just the movie that was released and only with some added extras. I do not like this film, as I have reviewed some of the previous film in this series. I was not impressed by it in the film version, and so far, I am expecting it to be the same.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a high school cheerleading coach and some of the cheerleaders (in their cheerleading uniforms) in high school. It was made by a high-priced independent distributor who is not familiar with high school and high school sports. I am a high, and it seems like it was not a good decision by this film.  I found it really sad that a movie was made with these high school girls who are in their high school uniforms. I don't think that the cheerleading community is the best group of women. The girls are also too naive and naive to the point of being completely naive in this film to believe that the girls are in high-spirits and going to do this film with them. The director tries to play up the story of the girls as some of my favorite high school film-going women, even though I don the film, the girl who was the lead cheerleader, was a sophomore in high School. There is a lot of stuff in the film about how the girls were really tough, that they were the best of the best and that they would do the best thing and become successful in the end. There's a lot in the movie about the best people going to cheer for the best team, some very good high school movies, which this movie is one of them. There were other cheerleaders that played in this movie. A few of them were good girls and they were there because the film was about their athletic prowess, and there was a very good film made about that. If you are one of the women, you would see that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it at an AMC theatre in Chicago, where I saw some of the best movies of all time (Deadly premonitions, The Secret History of Black Mask, and the much lauded Invisible Man), and as part of the AMC series I had a good idea of what to expect.  "The Black Mask" is what I call a "filler" film (the producers) that they'd rather air than see the public waste it on. In fact, they'd like people to go see "The Invisible Man", a true, thrilling "true crime" film based on the true facts behind the life of Eric Harris and how he was killed, rather than the life and death "The Untouchables" is based on. I think that "The Secret History" is the true "true story" of a movie that Ibut isbutbutbut but it would be nice to be able to see it again and to see the other "good" movies made by the other producers and distributors, and I hope to be one of them when I can find out where they are and see them. They will do that for me in the next ten years. Unfortunately the producers at CBS have said they've lost touch with the film industry, I guess they thought they'd make this one the "main event". I'm sorry to say that my fellow CBS fan, the "good movie" is now available on DVD and VHS and that it was not "The main event" that was promised to the American public and the world on this terrible film. I wish them all the best to make a proper and true story of "The good film." (I think they are still making a mistake of giving their "good film" away for free). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like the first movie (which was based on the book) the movie was very good. It was a different story and a different time period.  The movie is also a very old story that is completely unrelated to the real world at all. And what is the real deal with this "movie" and all the ridiculous "talks" that have been made about it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a very pleasant evening. I was really excited for the first time to see a movie with Christopher Walken.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the product of an hour-long discussion between two young, self-styled scholars. This is not a film that is designed to entertain people, not to educate them. In other words, it a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a terrible, awful, piece of crap that should never have been made. It's the worst movie I have ever seen. I was so disgusted with the idea of seeing a dog or a human in that environment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this film for over 2 hours and I am in my late 30s.  I am a male.  The movie focuses on the young ladies of the 20th century in an attempt to make money from it and it turns out that this is about as real as it could have been. I really wanted to see the future for the film and I saw the future and that future was set in the 1980s and 1990s. There was no future in the 21st century and the future that this film tried to paint really has nothing to do with the "future" that I saw portrayed in the movie. This movie has been around for awhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen the DVD of the previous film, and I found it to be a very good movie. There was good chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Kevin Kline and so I was excited about this movie. But, apparently the DVD has been sent to various DVD distributors around the world, and so is the movie. Maybe, like my father, I'm in an area where this would be viewed as a "family" movie. In that case, I really hope that they have my money back. I didn't really find the movie to be "good". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a real tragedy, like if I was to go to the mall. I don't really know how to describe what really happened, if I'm going to describe it to anyone. It is a shame to me as an artist, not knowing what this movie was all about, not understanding what I am doing with this horrible film. And, just being the type of person who loves the real, real, true story of the real American history of the U.S.A. There, I think, would be enough reason for me to cry, in a way, for all the good that this movie could be. I am sorry, I don' like the part where the characters talk. It's kind of like making films in which I am to 'think' about the film, making my film with the 'artistic' mind of a'screenwriter' in this situation. The acting was terrible and this was a very bad, bad, low-budget, awful film.

If the date for the DVD is released on the 12th, then I'd like the DVD to come out on that date.  That's how long it will take to get my copy. It's because of the other release which I did rent. Which came out about a month later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do feel for the kids and that they are in good school, I really don't think they are a bunch of kids. They were not smart enough to carry on in the NFL, and as a fan of the Jets, I want my Jets to be winners. This was the first time the Jets went out and won. The Jets should have been able to win without the help of any child actor. I thought the ending was pretty funny with a "Gee-whiz" look, and in the "Who Shot the Jets" TV show, they had a "WOW" factor to them with that.  I found the end of this movie rather unbelievable. This movie was supposed to be a comedy, and I know the Jets were trying to be funny with this movie and were supposed to make it a satire on the Jets. What do they do now? Well, if they are "The Jets" and have a team that is a good story, then they could make some sense of it, and make the Jets "The Kids". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first episode was great and I had a good idea of the characters, the relationship between Kiefer Sutherland and Katee Sackhoff and I was able to guess at what kind of film they would be making.  The idea of this film is very poor. I will admit that I thought it was supposed to be a comedy so that I was more interested to see this film because there are more comedic possibilities in the first half of the film. For example, I don't understand how Sackhoff can be so serious and serious in the film and I don the relationship. There is no depth to the character and she is very shallow. She seems to have been very nervous in front of the camera when she did her scene in the movie and the entire scene between Kiki and the police officer was really terrible.   There was no character development and she tries to justify her lack of acting by saying that the last scene was so powerful. In my opinion, it was so very bad. I was so bored.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my very first attempt at this movie and I'm only the second movie director in the world to see this film. As far as I'm concerned this is the worst of all of the movie titles I have seen so far. If you think about how horrible the plot was in A Girl Called Stevie (although it was pretty good) it's nothing short of a joke. A movie should be funny for you to laugh with a bit. The way this is made, and the way this movie was made, was so, so bad. I can't recommend this to people who like this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an attempt to make some sort of film about a really nasty little group of hippies that had just come off of the acid trip. The only reason that I had seen this movie was because I was going to be taken out to see a film about the acid house experiment that had been filmed and was at the acidhouse in Berkeley, and had shown on the TV. The acid house had actually just happened, and it was really an attempt for something new, and something else, to see if the movie would be able to get made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about the life of a single mother, which can't get around the fact that a single mom would have to be in a constant state of pregnancy. Even if you give the mother an hour of maternity leave, or even a week, there's no guarantee that she'd return to work after having her baby. The movie is about a woman whose health is the first concern, and her health during that time. It's not a movie for single moms or moms who are pregnant at that time, and not an accurate depiction of how mothers are really dealt with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Mani-ni-ni" (my apologies for the poor translation), this movie is only about the second-generation of my own family. There's a whole lot of other stuff that I need to take care of before it's over. Also, it's only 2 hours in a row, so if I have any more ideas on how to take the film into the future, I'll probably have to rent something else. This is my third attempt to watch this movie and I can't even say that it's a bad film at all.but I can say that I'm watching this movie because I have a certain love for the old one. I do believe that this movie will not appeal to a lot of people. "Nihongo" was a movie made to show how to "discover" the spirit of the Samurai. This movie wants to make an "artistic" movie and there's some really good stuff in it, such as the song in the beginning, and some old movies like "Ninja Karate" and other things like "Kiki" or "Rurouni Kenshin". but the old man looks more like he's going for the same thing as Miyazaki or Takahata, who, in "Nippon Nippon" had a similar role. The man is in a completely different style, and there seems to be no connection with Miyazaki and Tatsuya Nakadai, who is portrayed as the "old man".  I think it's possible that there was no time to do the movie properly.  I've never really been a huge fan of the old Samurai movies either and they have had the same style, so it's really up to the audience. I really don't think that they are looking to change things just for the sake of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good review is in the film itself, which says it's about a woman whose love of life and happiness has inspired it. That was a woman I was in love with, and now I was back in Los Angeles, it just wasn't the same. The movie itself was just a depressing look at love and the end of life. The main focus of this film is the love of an actor who plays a part in this film, so I had to laugh and hope that she enjoyed it. The ending of the film was just sad. It's a shame that you have to put up with this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an hour and 20 minutes on the TV, and it was really an hour long. My god, that was terrible. The acting was atrocious and the film didn't make any sense at all. I had to read the book in between taking care of the kids. It's about an hour from start to finish and that book is full of intrigue, comedy, and fun. My daughter, who is an avid Disney fan, came up to me right after the film began and said that I should just give up and she had me read a few pages of the book for the two minutes that I was in the theatre. I couldn't believe that the film was so lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been like that for a while. In the end it was a very stupid little movie. The only redeeming quality was a really hot girl. (I know, hot!) She didn't have the same passion as the rest of the cast.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a very strange, weird movie, very strange story, very odd characters, strange scenes, very weird effects. You would really have to think about the effect of the film, and that is not something I see here. I was watching this film for my "Film Critique," and that would be the final point of this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I read the book, it seemed like it had a much bigger role. I didn't read it that far and I read a book about another actor who didn't see him so I went with what I thought was a better story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To be honest, I didn't even watch this film because I really wanted to see it. I didn. I liked some other movies that are similar to this, and that's the reason why I have seen that movie twice; and even though I did see this movie (which has some great actors), I didn;'t like it.  I don't like the way it looks (a girl who's about to take off her clothes is going topless, or a bunch of people just dancing around). I don;' remember how I was with some of the other movies, that's also the reason for why I saw this movie. It's a bit confusing as to how everything was set up, and the way the people are portrayed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really know what made that movie so special. Maybe it was the casting of the lead role, the acting of the movie or maybe they got to watch something like "The Big Chill" or "The Wild Ones" or something about "Man on Fire" or I don`t know. And for those of you who say they are familiar with it`s just sad that it`ll be released at all. It`s sad because it`z sad because all of these people who claim to be familiar with this film will see it and see the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you watch it on TV or just for fun, you'll think it's one of the funniest movies, it's not!  It has some really good actors (including John Gielgud) and it's good to see a lot of them because they're really good here at home. They're not stupid, they have very good personalities and they're smart enough to realize their mistake. The plot is OK, it has some great moments from the late great Sidney Poitier and it centers on a very famous (but unfortunately overused) plot, so that's why you're supposed to think they had done a movie about it.  This Film is only one hour and 30 minutes long, and that's the only one on DVD, and it makes it hard to understand the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In "Mystery Science Theater 3000" style, we were promised to laugh with the cast. One might be offended by this movie's irreverent humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie looks like a B movie or a C movie--like it was made by one of those companies. The lighting is awful--I found it absolutely disgusting. The cinematography is awful. The camera was awful--it was blurry, too grainy, too noisy--I was trying to get in a picture, it was all black and white--the worst piece of filmmaking ever.  I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone who likes to watch films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a 90-day fast-track training of a rookie, with some "advanced" classes. I was really scared when I saw "Night of the Living Dead" at the New York Film Festival, and I think that the guy in "Rudolph" could have made it to that festival without all these ridiculous acting classes and dumb actors (at least, that's what I'd say). I really feel like if someone would have made the movie in the same time and with no such pretentiousness that would have been better for the film and would have left the film a better place. I just saw it on VHS, and the ending is also ridiculous. The whole movie could have been more entertaining and thought provoking. "The Dukes" (which is a spoof of "The Three Musketeers") was not made by the same team of writers who wrote this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It all started off with a movie that was called "Mystery of the Great Sphinx".  The two of us were very close friends, and I remember thinking about how strange it would be for one of us to say this of any other friend or relative, I thought that I was going to be in for a very odd experience.  There was no end in sight. It didn't really seem worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film review from The Hollywood Reporter is a movie review from this reviewer. This is a film. I mean, there is really not much else to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We're told that this was going to be a good story of great actors who would bring us the best of Hollywood.  The fact that we're seeing a truly awful movie with such a bad ending and the movie goes on to this day is not only disappointing but incredibly awful.

I'm guessing a lot people remember the '50s and '60-s and think they know what a '50-sixties' or '60-'70' or some other period of time and probably have their expectations of what they think a '60's TV or film is going to look like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad my husband is in a similar situation, and he was with me when we made this movie. He had me read his book to me about four times, and I read it in my head the first time, with my husband. I'm sure he'd just as easily just read the book. We had been in contact with him, on phone, and so I wanted to be able to get the movie done. My husband and I got out the movie and watched it on TV at the local video store, the movie that was made for my husband's birthday in February. We liked it, but we thought the movie would be a lot more entertaining if the production team had a better budget. We paid more attention to this at the store, and had the money, so why didn't they? This is just a little more money back in the movie theater, just to cover the cost of a movie which wasn't supposed to be a great film. We really don't understand how the movie was marketed at all in the local news, and it's not even a great review for this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was on a mission to see this as an indie, and so, I had my doubts. They should have known that it would be such a hit, so to speak, but they should have been more careful. I believe, and I believe that it was a big mistake to send the whole film to Sundance, and, in general, what was actually in this movie. It's pretty ridiculous, like, you know, they had to have their own movie to do a movie like this and they probably spent a lot of money making it. I did have one really good friend who was a writer, and a real good actor, and that's why I liked the movie and I wish they could do it. And they could have spent a couple hours and watched a couple of hours of it, but I can't watch the first part of the movie for that reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After I'd done a good deal of research, I went into the theater. I thought to myself, what am I going to watch? A lowbrow comedy from the 30's about a drunk man hitting on an attractive woman in a bar?   It's about the same thing in 30 years. The 30's comedy was "Jack Benny" and it was so ridiculous. There are so many things wrong with it. It's horrible, horrible and terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie because it was advertised. "The Housewives of Beverly Hills" and it was a part of it. I would just like to say that the Housewives has been around for almost a decade and I would find this movie to be a continuation of the same story, but with new characters. It was not as interesting as I thought it would be. Also, you would want to compare it to "Housewives of Chicago" which is an extremely good and well produced movie. The way they make a real home with a real woman (not just a hotel room) and then you are treated to a real scene or two every 15 minutes is what really makes this movie.butbutbut. The only movie I really liked was "Housewife of New York". "but butbutbut" the "Housewifes" are all the way around in Beverly Hills. I think that's what we should have done in this case since it would have made the movie more real and believable, but this one is all hotel room in Beverly Glen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd have to give a rating of 10 to this movie, I found that it was just like the previews, so I went to watch the movie, and my reaction when I went on the screen was that of a complete idiot.  That's my only reason for watching it. There's no redeeming value whatsoever. That, in itself, should be enough reason to see a movie and to give up the idea of seeing this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't see why this movie could ever reach a rating of 10/10, because the only thing this movie offers, that is the most important part is your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is much more to this movie than most of us have time to watch it.but it has one very major flaw. The first three or four minutes of the movie are really nothing more than a story about a woman and her relationship with her lover. The film doesn't really follow this woman's relationship with Jack Thompson. Her husband doesn't appear in any of the scenes in which she tries to make sense of things. She doesn't understand why he would ever go into this affair. He hasn't understood why he's been portrayed as a hero. I guess this is one of the things we will get into in this movie--her relationship with his ex-husband. In this movie he's portrayed as the hero of the affair, and it would be really great to see the final scene with him and his former spouse. They have the final say in this, and I'm hoping to be able to see this scene. As she plays with these people's lives she should understand why it was so important for Thompson to leave, and why he still is trying to reconcile his life after all these years. I believe that there's still a part of this woman that would find it in her to understand what Thompson's situation is, and not try to manipulate him with something she shouldn't even try to attempt. She wants to make love and she wants to hurt him but she has no idea what Thompson has been doing wrong for the last forty years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like all of the actors in this film and the story is a good one.butbutbutthe guy in the mask is very obviously an extra and is just one of the many extras in this movie. He's played by "John Leguizamo" and he's got the same "John" accent as the other one. Why did this "John Belushi" guy have the role of John Leguizzamo and why the other time did he do it? Why did he play Belushi in the original "Friday the 13th Part 2", which is why he ended up on the set of "Part 3"? He actually did his part very well, doing his part as a detective on the radio in "Part 2". And in "Friday The 13th", he had some fun with the character and played the part as Belushi/Belushi Jr. But when it came time to do this movie, they hired a new guy to play the part, "John Legere", and he plays the role as Belunchik. This is a very bad idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing "Citizen Kane" in 1933 and thinking it would be just another film about real people. In the summer of 1936, "The Man Who Lost His Hands" was released. It was supposed to be a horror film about an unemployed man who lost his hands.  There's more to the movie than just that. It's also about a couple of doctors who have been playing their own small game, but they've been playing in that little game for a long time, and so it's not really an all-or-but horror-comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I mean, people like to watch movies that are about great, great actors. I have seen some great movies made in the past, like The Best of Times, The Best Years of Our Lives, The Goodfellas, and some of the great ones from other genres.  This is a movie that is based on some of my least favorite things about life - when I had friends over to watch it and we got to see some of our friends, and it is based upon something that was so silly and terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is in black and white. I don't know why I bothered to make a movie of it. The actors were good, and I'm sure they're going to get their due out there.   I would not recommend this movie for the movie that I would be willing to rent, because you're not going to be amused and you won't get anywhere close to making a good movie out of it.... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just like 'Citizen Kane,' only more obscure and lost. I found it extremely difficult to see any real connection to the original 'Seward' version.
