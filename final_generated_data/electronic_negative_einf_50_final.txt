Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got a brand new 3-button desktop computer, and it works great but I have problems with it. First, the serial port connector is in the center of the keyboard, rather than being on the side. Second, the USB port on the computer uses the wrong type of connector (USB 1.1). Third, if you plug in a thumb drive, it won't work. I can't get the computer to read a CD and I can only use it as a browser.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first thing that got us down was that when we plugged in our wireless keyboard to the tablet we couldn't get it to recognize it.   We were told this was because it was designed for the older generation of devices.  The second thing we encountered was the battery.  If you're going to spend the money, make sure it's worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've bought several Sony BDP-105 MP3 players and a SACD card reader and have always had problems with the audio quality.  This Sony player does not have these problems, but it still seems like a fluke.  It has the same level of sound as my older BDP players and SACDs, but with a much more transparent sound that seems to come out of the speakers.  Even though it is not as loud as an iPod, the sound quality of this player is good enough for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I ordered this card reader to get my cell phone out of my purse, I was really disappointed. The card reader was very badly designed, I mean really bad. The metal disc with the antenna was very bendable, but when you try to open the card reader, the disc flexes violently. The plastic card reader (I got a cheap one, which has a plastic backing) seems to be ok, but the metal disc always bent after a while. If I'm not mistaken, it's supposed to be supposed to get bent after the card is used, but it never did. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My old DVD player broke about 5 years ago.  The DVD player is only good for so long, but the new player has the same problem, the player's drive dies after about 6 months.  I would like to buy a new player, but I can't because I have no money to buy something from the store. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've bought several of these   over the past 5 years   to upgrade old or non-functional devices.   The first was a digital camera I'd dropped a couple of times.  It eventually failed and was replaced with a much cheaper   unit  (  I don't remember which model).   This time I bought a Sony e-reader, a cheap DVD recorder and an old USB cable.  Unfortunately, none of the units  had anything useful on them.  I tried reading the book on the CD, but it was a very bad copy   and the software was just as bad.  After searching  I found that Amazon sells them for cheap   so I tried a few other places, but there was no benefit to buying them   (they all turned out to be inferior).  I eventually purchased a Kindle.  Since that time,  it's gotten much worse.  Every day it's been down for months.  The software is completely broken and there's no reason   for it to work.  My only hope is that this is just a temporary thing and my e-readers will be working again when the time comes.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a new PC back in October 2011 to replace my old one that stopped working after 2 years.   The new one, a 3.0ghz quad core, would work for about 6 months, but then would crash.  Then it would fail in the middle of the day.  Eventually I bought the 4.0gig version that supposedly has better ram, and I still couldn't get it to work for more than a few hours.  It died completely with just the hard drive.  I finally gave up and just got a new drive, so the hard disc will have to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a pair of these speakers for my new computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note, I wanted to like it. But I was disappointed that it did not work as I expected.   It came with no manuals, no batteries, and an extremely poor battery performance.  I thought I was getting a deal when I bought it because it was advertised as being a 10 hour phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only use I can think of for a $9 piece of crap is as a portable speaker.  A couple of times, while at a conference, I used it to play music from my iPhone while waiting in line for food or drinks. The volume is really, really loud, but I'm not sure if it would sound as good in your car. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The batteries used are very unreliable and cheap (so cheap I'm surprised I can get them in the first place).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product is fantastic, but it's a very lousy interface.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst wireless device   I have ever used.   The poor design and poorly made antennas make the device very difficult to use.  It would be fine for small handsets, but not for a smartphone.  I could barely type on my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my iPod Touch had trouble connecting to the phone.  Even the iPod Touch was slightly worse.  These things should have been left to die in the junkyard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The original iPod was the best I had ever used, with its sleek design and easy access to every function. Unfortunately, the new iPod, which features the same plastic housing but with a metal case, is very clunky, and it takes forever to load it up with songs, even after paying $20 for a used iPod. The iPod Nano is much easier to use, but I still prefer the iPod Classic over the Nano. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod Classic and the Shuffle have some nice features. The former comes with a removable cable.   However, the Shuffles, while nice enough, are not very portable.  A 5" Shuffle can fit nicely in my front pocket.  The former requires me to use the "magnetic" port.  It's an odd design decision that I find frustrating. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't know if I'd buy another. It only has one "mode," which is "on," meaning the light is always on.  It's kind of annoying, especially since the battery is really small and usually used for little stuff.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this card to use on my laptop because I use an external hard drive for media and don't have an optical drive in my laptop. It arrived in the mail a couple days after I ordered. It's not the worst card that I've ever used, but it's also not the best. First, the card isn't backwards compatible with optical drives. Second, there's no way to install Windows on it. Third, it's not cheap. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I plugged in a Sony mp3 player to my computer, I had a major problem: the device wouldn't even recognize the computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As an audio/video professional, I love the quality of the digital video and sound on the iPod. However, my iPod can't be used in the back of my vehicle for driving, because of the bulky design. I can't find a case that fits.  I bought a cheapo case from a junk store (that doesn't work well). It has no back or pockets. It's very flimsy.  Also, I'd like a longer cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the E-Stick from a local electronic shop to replace a defective one that I had bought in a different electronic store.  The new one worked just as well.  When the old one started to fail, I returned it and bought the original one from the store.   The new E-stick has a very bad reputation and has been reported as an electronic shorted out.   It takes forever to boot up, even when you're watching videos.  Even more annoying, when I try to turn it on and it won't work, it just turns off and I have to try again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this card reader to do my iPod in addition to my computer. The card reader came the next day, but it would only read up to the current capacity of the memory card (which is about 8 MB), so I had to buy more. When I got the card reader, it was defective, the contacts were loose, and the reader would only fit one card. I tried to return the defective card reader for a refund, but the card company won't take it. So I'm stuck with the defective one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item as an upgrade for my old, working iPod and have been completely disappointed. The player plays all the songs from my previous iPod perfectly, and then crashes every time I want to play some music from my new iPod. I contacted Apple Support and they suggested that I make a disk image that copies all the data from my old iPod onto the new one.   This sounds like a great idea to me, but after spending over $200 on a new iPod, I was unwilling to make a new disk image on a brand new iPod to copy my songs over.  I ended up using my older iPod to try and copy the data back over from it, and after trying a number of times with varying degrees of success, it eventually took too long and I gave up.  Overall, this is an extremely frustrating experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod is great if you have a compact mp3 player. The problem is that you can't use it to listen to audio books.   I'd rather have a decent iPod than a mediocre mp3 for the price of a cheap mp3.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the first USB to E-Sata adapter I've owned and I can't recommend it.  The adapter is so cheaply made that the plug (the very thing that plugs into the hard drive) has to be bent up and down and pushed down against the hard disk before it will work.  (You have to do this to the adapter itself to install it.)  This makes it unusable to me.  Also, the adapter has a "light" that is activated when the hard drives are inserted.  It lights up and stays on the entire time.  This turns the adapter into a very annoying (but unnecessary) light.  I can barely read anything at all using the adapter.

The  iPad Mini  is no different.  The sound is so muffled that  it's distracting.  I can't even watch a movie or listen to music through the iPad,  it sounds so tinny and  muffled.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device because I was having problems with my old portable CD player, and found that I could make a "mini-disc" by ripping the music from a cassette.  I was very happy with the sound of this "disc" player, but when I connected the player to my computer to download the music, it immediately got very slow.  In fact, it was completely unusable.

I had to buy one that would work with the USB 3.0 standard. The USB 3 adapters I bought from Amazon cost more than the iSticks.

I did find a new model on the site with a different size battery (3.5 volt), but even that doesn't make up for the cost difference in this unit. I'd return this product as soon as I get the chance, and won't buy another from the manufacturer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first thing you notice about the MP3 player is the sound quality. It's a great-sounding mp3 player that costs $50 more than an iPod, but it lacks the quality that you get with an iPod. It has only a tiny bit of memory for your music, but that's all it has. You'll need to buy more music with the mp3-player, and it's just not as convenient as the iPod.

There's no volume slider or any way to control the phone's volume. I ended up replacing the phone several times because I kept getting the same problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This   is   the   worst   I   have   ever   owned   and   i   cannot   use it   because   its   always   too   hot   when   doing   things .  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first thing I noticed when playing with it is how light it is. When I put my headphones on and crank up my volume to listen to music, it feels like I'm walking on air. But, that lightness makes me nervous.  It takes a lot of effort to hold the screen down, and if you're not careful, it can fall out during use.  That said, I don't see myself replacing my phone anytime soon.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit I have was very cheaply built and very poorly assembled. It is very hard to use with a micro USB cable. When I try to use a separate HDMI cable, it does not work at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with the first generation of the iPod  I have used for the past 4 years  I would be hard pressed to give it 4 stars  It does the job but  The sound quality is not very good and I can't really hear the tracks well 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great little computer. However, the software that came with it was a complete joke.  I tried to use it to get a working printer, then had to return it to the store. It would not even print a.pdf file, and it wouldn't boot up!  I did manage to find a program called "Ogre" that would run on a Mac, and I also found a program that would work on a PC. Both of them did exactly what I wanted, but I just can't recommend this for anything else.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem   I have is that I have several different brands of USB cables, and it's the same problem:  When I try to plug it in, the cord comes out of the adapter, and doesn't come back.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had this thing for about a month. It has been great and reliable, but I had to switch to the USB stick because the 3.5mm adapter I use doesn't work with my Windows 7 laptop.  I tried using an adapter from a different brand, but the adapter worked just fine with the laptop, so I was left with the USB dongle.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a refurbished Thinkpad T430 laptop. I was very happy with the way it worked out but one month into the warranty I noticed that the power button would not work and the computer would not turn on.  A couple of weeks later I had the replacement Thinkpad with the button work out fine.  I am very satisfied with the product but I am still very disappointed that the replacement was not any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the XO3 over the XZs in the hope that it would be better for my computer.  It is not.  I can get a better sound with my headphones, but that's about it.   They also make my computer boot up faster, but I'd rather the other way around 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S III last year and really enjoyed my experience with it.   This time around,  I was not as happy.  It takes forever to charge,  it doesn't have a removable battery (batteries are expensive), and  it's really loud (it's really not even on the level of a normal phone).  I really don't know if I'm just unlucky or if my phone is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got this unit, I was expecting it to work like a CD player (at least that's what it looked like in the box). Instead it is an MP3 player that plays MP3s. I can't listen to it without laughing. It's the worst mp3 player I've ever had. When I used a CD- player as a kid, it worked great. I wish this one would work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As a consumer, I bought a cheap computer that I expected to be a disappointment.  The only complaint I had about my new machine was the poor sound quality and lack of a DVD drive.  Since I couldn't use the sound card on my old computer I had bought, I purchased a new one.  This one is a total failure.  I have no idea why it doesn't work.  It boots to a blank screen.  When I try to access it via the keyboard, the system turns itself off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought the R-7, the first thing I tried was the remote.  It was very easy to use, but it's very flimsy and poorly built.  The buttons are extremely sensitive and will break very easily when you press hard enough.  Even after it was broken, the buttons wouldn't work.  If you are not careful, you can easily damage the remote with a hard push.  I've sent it back two times to get a replacement. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item should be returned as defective   It doesn't work, and when it does work, it takes forever to get it to the point where it will work.  I have used it on several different computers and in the past on a floppy disk player  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this with the intent to use it for a cheap blu ray player. It worked great for that purpose, but I found the sound quality to be terrible.  It sounds like you're standing in front of a stereo speakers rather than a pair of headphones. It is just not very good.  The remote works well enough.  I've been using my iPod with it as well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first thing I noticed about the Apple Watch was the screen.  It's clear and bright, but it's just a little too big for my liking.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device to watch an old television show, but it turned out to be a crap.   It is terrible for a number of reasons.  It does not work with my old, non-Blu Ray player.  The TV looks awful when watched on a computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the dac9 adapter because it is a cheap, portable way to get analog signals from my digital recorder and then convert them to digital.  The adapter works well, but the audio quality is horrible.  You will need some high-quality digital cables (not the cheap ones that go to the d-s-c jack) to make it work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using this device since it came out and it works great, I was concerned about having to buy the separate wireless card, but once I figured out I could just plug it into the USB port on my pc and not the card I was happy to go with this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The   I purchased to replace my   3 year old   laptop is terrible.   Every time I boot it up, it locks up and shuts down.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The USB port is not great. It has a nasty noise when you try to connect a portable hard drive to it.  The interface is so flimsy that it doesn't work with the USB devices I've bought from Amazon.  I have bought many gadgets over the years from Amazon and this one is the most expensive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst thing I have ever bought.

If I used this as my main device for recording a podcast or something like that I wouldn't even bother with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had this for a year, but after a few months, I had to replace it with a new one. The main problem was the failure of the internal battery after about 100 charges. The battery was getting so weak that it was completely draining the USB port after just 30 minutes of use. I replaced it with another one from Newegg. That worked fine, but when the new one started failing after about a month of use, I finally gave up and bought a 3 year old one from Amazon instead.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very poor quality   The remote is so flimsy and bad that it bends or breaks on it's own whenever it's pressed against something soft (like my camera) and it's so poor quality that the pictures from it will always be blurry and unusable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My iPod touch died while I was on vacation with my family this past week. When I went to get a new one, I discovered that the previous model I bought had been discontinued, and that my replacement (which is about a year old) was defective.   After using the replacement, I found that the internal flash is now permanently damaged.  If I don't do something about this problem, I'm going to need to replace my entire iPod touch family 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a pair of these last fall, thinking they were some sort of hybrid between a cassette deck and a CD player.  They were terrible.  The first one I got (a brand new one) was a dead battery, the second one the tape would not work.  After about 6 months (and the second defective one)  I gave up on them.   They are much too expensive for what they are. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this   in hopes that it would work better than the other one  that I had   for use with the 3DS and I am sorry to say that   the   battery   is   completely   dead   after   using  it   all   day   to the point   that  I have to remove it from the dock to make a video,  because  I  don't   have a backup   so  I cannot   use it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First, I would like to thank eHam for sending this new, improved  eHam USB-2 cable that works flawlessly.   It has an excellent connection to my old   iBook.  But I have to say it is so flimsy that I can hardly put it back on my   computer.  My old  iMac   and other old computers   could be lifted and moved easily to get to their power cords   even though I'd put a new cable on every time.  The old  e Ham cable  has the same problem.  It's flimsy and  so fragile that I'm afraid I'll break it   on the first day I use it.  If they can make this  inexpensive, they have a winner here. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace my    Sony CF card.   Instead, it came with two different card readers.  After spending $50 on a couple of adapters, I could only access one of the card readers, leaving the other card inoperable.  When I asked about it, they said it could be my card reader, but they couldn't figure out where it went.  To be clear, I have never had a problem with the card reader on   my CF card, so I'm disappointed to see it broken.  I can't get the card in and out.  It's just a card reader 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit I received only has a USB port.   It is difficult to connect the phone to it.  It takes several tries to get the two units to connect.  The units are cheap.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am very disappointed.   My iPad is now useless.  It has a defective charger.  The charger's capacity is a joke compared to what the iPad says it can charge.  If it took a full 8 hours to charge it, that's way too much.  I'm not even sure it will work after it dies.  After the battery died twice before I had to order a new one from Apple, I'm really not happy with this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The price was really good, but there were no accessories like rubberized sleeves for the earpieces, which you would think would be required to prevent damaging your ears.   There was also no way to connect my phone while using the earphones.  I just bought two of these earphones to replace two I already had.  These headphones are so cheap I expect to have to buy them again soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was hoping that this would be a great replacement for my  Mac, but it didn't deliver.  The screen was flaking after a month of use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I got the VX-700, I tried to charge it using a USB-A to USB-C adapter that I had and was unsuccessful.  I also tried to hook it up with the included USB-to-mini-B adapter, which didn't work either.  As a result, I sent the V-700 back.  The second time around, I decided to give it another shot.  When I plugged it into a computer and attempted to charge the device, it immediately shut down.  However, I was able to boot the computer and boot it up using a cable that I'd bought from the site.  This time, it worked, and I was finally able to use my Apple laptop for anything but working on the V7.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I ordered a wireless card reader to use for a Sony Vaio computer.  It's horrible!  It only reads cards with an 8-digit number, but not the larger ones.  The card reader takes forever to work.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to watch my favorite TV series, "Star Trek: The Next Generation". I had just purchased a good digital video recorder, and this had the image quality of the recorder but better sound quality.   However, the audio quality is terrible. The TV shows don't sound natural in this recorder.  I watched "Encounter at Farpoint" on DVD and heard the dialogue in my head as I listened to the recording, but on this recorder the dialogue sounded like it was recorded in a vacuum.  The sound effects were also horribly recorded. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this device, hoping it would be able to be used on my iPod Touch.  I was not disappointed:  The  external hard drive is the size of a credit card.  It  doesn't   need the adapter,   which is very  inconvenient. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this and it came with some pretty good specs and all of them are good, but the audio quality is terrible.  The sound is a muddy mess and is more like what you would get with a crappy iPod than a great one.  My iPod 5 was much more reliable and much better in audio quality.  I'm really hoping that this one will turn out well for me, but it's a total loss. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This phone is garbage.  It takes forever to charge and the battery dies immediately after you turn it on.  This is especially embarrassing when you're trying to watch a movie or something.   The audio quality is OK, but the device's camera and microphone are pretty lousy.  I use the Nexus 4 to watch my Netflix shows and the quality is very nice.  However, when I'm on a flight or something, I have to use the iPad, which is much better.  Hopefully Google fixes this problem soon, but at this point it really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is not a good product.  This device will make a huge mess and destroy your electronic device.  It is too big to fit on a phone, so the whole thing gets knocked over and it takes forever to put it back together again.  I have to buy another device when my current one dies.   It costs a lot more than a normal phone, but it will cost you twice as much time and effort to repair a bad device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these to replace my old ones, but unfortunately I was only able to use them one time before they were too hard to insert and the batteries died.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The original iPod is not an iPod anymore. The one I bought from Apple was defective. I had to return it, but my replacement came a month late.    I don't care about the music, but I like my music on my computers. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to connect my Canon PowerShot S100 to my iPad.  When I connected it, the screen froze for a good five minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the G3 from Amazon and it failed.  I emailed customer service to complain about it and they said that they were shipping the broken one back and I would have to pay shipping costs and that they could not replace the broken part.  The part worked fine when it was in the package and the problem was with the user interface.  This was my fourth failure with the same Amazon product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit worked great until my computer crashed and I needed to install Windows on it. I did, but the unit was so badly damaged I don't want to use it again. I will probably give up on my e-readers after this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very disappointed in the design and quality of this disc drive.

I would recommend that this disc-read only drive is discontinued.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a very nice device, but it is a total pain to use. You have to plug it into a USB port on your computer, then you have to download a drivers (if you have not already) and you have a USB cable that needs to be plugged into the device as well. It is not very convenient.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing is a total pain to use. I've had it since the first version came out. It's made from plastic, and there are no buttons or other design features. The case is pretty flimsy and the little button on the bottom that I use to start/stop is hard to get to. Plus, even though it doesn't take up a lot of space, it takes forever to get any kind of decent music out of it. The battery is bad too. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really wanted to love my new iBook.  It took a few minutes to set up and get everything connected, but once that was done, everything worked well.  After I finished using it, I realized that my hard drive, DVD drive and card reader all worked flawlessly with the new iMac.  When I went to go do something else, the computer shut down and went into Safe Mode and restarted without even asking me if I wanted to do so.  So I guess I've got a few more years before I have to replace the whole iBook with the iBook G3. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this device as a gift for my girlfriend, but she couldn't use it due to her faulty 3-button mouse.  While the unit is very cool, the 3-Button Mouse is terrible.  The button that makes clicking on the buttons click is too small to click with one's finger.  And the other two buttons are so wobbly that they make a grinding noise when pressed.   The device is good enough to read printed documents on the Web, but the mouse itself is useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a T1/2/3 hard drive and had it for about a year, but I couldn't even get it to work for a couple of days.

But, I was able to get it working with a couple other HD player drives I had on hand after replacing the hard drive I was using with the replacement drive.  It takes a long time for any of my other drives to be working at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After about a month of use, I was very disappointed in this    First, the display is horrible.  It has terrible colors, a small font, and it doesn't display any information except the time and date.  When I press the "up" button to scroll up a page, the "page up" text gets cut off by a solid black line.  I also have a problem with the SD card reader.  Because the card has to be inserted, all I have to do is hit the "insert" button and it instantly locks up.  This can be fixed by replacing the card, but I really wanted to use this as my main drive instead of one of the external drives I have.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm not very happy with my new mp3 player, because the battery never gets charged and has a habit of dying, so I have to have a new battery almost every time I use it. It's not a big deal if it does die (usually a week later), but it's always something I have been forced to deal with when purchasing a new mp player, as opposed to something like my computer which only ever has problems once or twice a year. I'm really hoping for some sort of battery replacement program or something similar so I can just get a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is not very good.  It is very light and good for its price point, but it does not offer all the features it claims.   The microphone is very sensitive to sound.  When there is a loud sound, it records the sound and puts it on the SD card.  If the volume is turned down, it does the same thing but only stores a lower-pitched sound. The audio quality is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a cheap Chinese phone and found that it was not compatible with most of the apps that I use. After many months, I finally purchased the iPhone and it works very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this for my wife's iPod that never got along well with any of the other music players we've owned. She is the kind of person who needs something new and never really knows what to get until she buys something new. This one seems to be very well-made and a bit more stable than the others we've tried. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am sorry to say that I do not recommend this card. I have an   MacBook  and I used to use this card  to connect to a   Mac  but  the  card  always  refused to work  and then  I got tired  of  getting a new one  but then  found out that  you need to install the card  at the time you buy the  computer  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have used the Logitech C920 and C920 Pro for several years.  I had an issue with the C920 a few months back.  The problem was with the USB port, which would cause it to shut down the computer every time I plugged in my hard drive.  Fortunately, Logitech's replacement parts came very quickly.  But the C720 is a far cry from the original.  It's much flimsier, has a tiny, hard drive slot in the back, and is about 2.5 times as expensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I used this I was really excited and used it for several months. The first day I used it, I realized I was stuck with a poor quality, clunky phone. It worked perfectly on the first day, then broke within a month.  I ended up returning it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is a joke! I got it for a free camera at the local camera store, and it's useless for anything except for video recording. I couldn't even get it to work. Even if it were plugged in it wouldn't turn on or turn off. It is so fragile that it almost falls apart on the first time you try to use it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The  LG Optimus Laptop is a great laptop. It's fast, it's easy to get into, and it's built like a tank.   It has a built in keyboard, so I can write on it without having to go out and buy a new keyboard.  But, the touchpad is horrible.  It's too small and I find that the cursor doesn't always stay where I want it to.  If I need to write on the web or on a large document, I usually end up just touching the screen, which leads to a big error message.  The speakers are decent, but they tend to get muffled when I have lots of background noise.  Overall, it is a very good laptop. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new iPod because it was the only good one in my possession and I was looking forward to using it for a while. However, the device came with the dreaded "jacket" which is kind of a crummy plastic that will eventually get in the way. I had to get it off my new iPod and now it's hanging in my car in the back seat, blocking my view of my music. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The original Eero adapter would not let me use the HDMI port on my HDTV, so I bought this one to connect it to my 1080p LCD monitor.  The first few tries just did not work.  After I had it plugged in, the HDMI connection did not show anything, so the adapter was probably dead.  I tried plugging in a different monitor, another HDMI cable, and a different HDMI cable again. Nothing worked.  So I'm hoping the HDCP issue will be fixed with the next generation adapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The quality is good but the packaging is very poor.  The box came broken in half, and then the other half of the box came damaged too.  No box cutter was used.  I'm sure I'll be able to figure out how to use a box cutter to cut the plastic case off of the battery compartment, but it's a bummer that I can't use the charger or the card reader either. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After a lot of trying, I managed to get my  iPod (    ) working again. It took over 2 weeks to resolve my   problems. I don't know how Apple was able to make a "perfect" device, but the fact that   they haven't made one in the past few years is  ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very happy to receive my  Macbook Pro    for free   But  It would never load a song to the iPod so I gave it a low rating because the  external hard drive   doesn't seem to be able to handle it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned an Apple iPhone since early 2011, and I'm sad to say that it is now time for the next model.   The iPhone 5 does everything my iPhone does, except better.  It has 4 times the storage space (2x more than my iPhone 4s), twice the memory (64mb instead of 16mb), and 2 times as many LED lights (allowing me to change my phone's color and brightness).  The new iPhone will also run on the same battery for over 2 weeks!  But the best thing about the iPhone 4 and 4s is that they still work great after all these years. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First, I would like to make a point about the quality of the device: I purchased this because it is advertised as being rugged and is advertised to withstand a drop. However, I have dropped this thing a total of three times (both of which were from a very high height and from waist height), and it still works perfectly. I'm not trying to be flippant, but this is a total waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my first attempt with audio recording, and I am so disappointed.  This device does not record audio very well, at all.  I've had good luck with the cheaper microphones/headphones from the store.  They recorded great audio.  Unfortunately, I used it the wrong way.  Used the built-in mic to record my dog barking, I then used it to record myself.  The microphone always sounded bad, like it was plugged in backwards.  It also had a horrible high-pitched whine that I never use any of my expensive recording devices for. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit arrived very quickly, and I was pleased to see it was a USB drive.  But when I tried to format the drive to use as a hard drive, I found that my computer did not recognize it.  I gave up and ordered a new one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The  Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 8.0    was delivered to me yesterday.  I was very excited about using this tablet because of the great reviews and low prices.  Unfortunately,  the  tablet   I received   is a total disappointment .   Despite   claims  that  it   has an   excellent   camera   and  a good   display  ,  it is  much worse   than   these   promises.   It   also  has a   bad   charging   connection   which   renders   all   my   other   electronic devices   useless.  Although  the screen is good, the poor   image quality is very frustrating. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just picked up a Samsung Galaxy S4 from Best Buy after having the S III for 3 months, and immediately went for this one.   The device is perfectly fine, but the screen is terrible.  It's literally unusable.  There's virtually no contrast and everything has a red hue.  I can't figure out what kind of problem I have with the screen so I'm going to exchange it.  Hopefully that'll help. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of the MP-2 is awful. It's almost as if the music is being recorded in the dark by a low-quality mike that doesn't have much volume control. It doesn't matter that the MP2 can be used to record and transfer music to and from your digital MP3 player, it just doesn't sound very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a back up device to replace my older computer. I got this device for my own PC, but I've since been transferred to another company as their network is now down. The unit worked just fine when I tried to use it, but since it was not an option for me, I did not use it for a few weeks. When I heard that it was a free device, I wanted to get it. Unfortunately, I found out that it came in a small case instead of a bag. Since I don't have an external hard drive, I was unable to install this. I called Microsoft and got a refund.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Purchased this unit for my iPhone and was happy with it until the second day, when the headphone jack on my iPhone 5 broke.   It was not plugged in and it came to my attention that the cable was not the correct size to fit my iPhone.  Now I have to return it to the store 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I purchased this card reader my expectations were very high. It came with all the hardware and software you would need to install Linux on it and run applications from it. However, there is a glaring and very major shortcoming with this device.  It is very, very slow.  As a consumer I expect my devices to be able to read and write fast.  I was expecting the reader to read one disk every second or two.  When it took over four hours to read a single disk it became clear to me that this device was destined to fail.  If you use Linux it would be very easy to replace the entire card reader with a better one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The Sanyo mx-5100 has very few features that I really want in a CD player.  It doesn't have auto playback, automatic pause, or disc changer (although I can see why someone might use this feature).   While the CD player has an internal optical drive and supports MP3 playback, I don't have the CD-Rs to get the CD's I want.  While there is a built in TV tuner, the tuner can't be switched on and off.  Other than that, this is a nice player.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the most disappointing purchase I have ever made.   I was very excited about the USB adapter I received.  Unfortunately, it didn't work.  I sent it back.  When it finally arrived, I had to open it up, remove the 3 small screws, and take apart the whole thing.  The USB interface was bad.  It would randomly disconnect and the software would not recognize it.  As soon as I inserted it, everything would work again.  So, now I have to pay twice as much to return the poor product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing good about the CD-RW drive is that it can be installed on a PC without destroying the hardware. Unfortunately, I have the same problem with a PC that is built in the UK: the drive itself is bad (sending read errors). When I tried to make it work, it would say "unreadable". That's a problem for me, as my main PC is a laptop with a solid-state drive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the new iPad 2 (with Retina display) on May 11th for my daughter as a birthday present.   Although it was advertised as a 4G iPod, I could not get it to even pick up a signal on AT&T's network.  My last iPod (the first generation) did not work well on 3G, either.  The new iPad had the same problem.  When I returned the new iPod to Apple, they replaced it with the same iPod that I had just given to my daughter.  It did not even work on AT & T's network, but it still worked on my family's computer at my house.  I now have the same issue with my daughter's

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was happy to see that the RCA inputs could be switched. The output impedance was a bit high, and when I played my RCA cables through a 1/4" TRS output terminal, I noticed a lot of distortion in the signal. I figured that the output jack had some kind of inductance, so I removed it and replaced it with a thin-film TRS audio jack. It worked fine. I still have a bad TRS cable, but I'm satisfied with the TRS input.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works well but:  The battery is very fragile and is easy to bend and break.  If the battery dies, you have to replace it.   Also, the SD card reader is so finicky that it takes 3 tries to copy a SD card.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device is a disappointment.  The quality is not much better than that of a Chinese clone.  It's just a cheap plastic box with some basic electronic components.  I don't know why you would include a battery with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The card reader on my Lenovo Laptop has two problems:  First, the card reader does not function correctly if the card is inserted upside down.

The second problem is that the card cannot be removed from the reader until you turn it upside down and push the card back in.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really liked the design of the PDA I bought for my iPod. It looks and works good.  The only problem I have is that the USB port is so small that I can't plug it into my computer at all.  I can only use my computer's USB port.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this after I bought my RCA adapter. I wanted to be able to watch TV on my computer.  I don't like using my computer as a DVD player so I bought the RCA. I got it working pretty well, until the adapter started acting weird. I changed the adapter's power adapter to a 5.5mm audio plug. No problem with the adapter.   Then, after a year of using this adapter, I bought another one, and I'm still getting the same problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It seems like it would have been better off with an SD card slot. The camera is poor and the camera interface is buggy. It won't record video unless you run a program called "camera" which comes with the camera. This means that you have to download the camera program to your computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad   The first time I used this device, I connected it to my CD player in order to get the song played in full. The audio quality was terrible. I didn't even get the track start. I had to use the volume control on my CD Player to get it started. The second time I purchased it, I did it again. It worked perfectly, and the audio quality improved dramatically. However, there was a bug that resulted in the software (that plays the MP3 file) always playing in mono. I have to say, this was my worst experience with a CD player, ever.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It seems a bit flimsy and is less durable than some of the other I've had (also, has a slightly different layout and a different function). I have the Sony HM-1000, Sony MDR-100 and Nokia N95. I've all had their problems. However, the one thing that makes it stand out from the others is that the SD card slot is on the front. I don't think I've ever used a non-SD card slot.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this monitor for my 16" Macbook pro. I used the computer for some of my photo editing work, and I decided to take some of the images from my camera with me when I needed to show them off.   Unfortunately, the monitor had problems with the color of the photos, and it didn't show the original, unprocessed, files.  I had to use a photo editing program to edit and crop out the photos.  The software cost $40.  This cost me more money than the monitor itself did.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound of my laptop speaker is excellent, and it's definitely the best audio I've ever heard on a laptop.   However, the USB connection is just terrible, especially for large USB drives (I have 8TB of data on my hard drive, so I have to get very creative about how I use USB).   I just can't use it for anything more than occasional transfer of files.  It's not that it's a bad device -- it's just that it doesn't play well with others. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPod, or whatever you wanna call it, is really annoying.  It won't play any audio CDs that I own or even give me a hard time about using it.  This isn't an audiophile grade device by any stretch of the imagination.  I am not a die hard CD/audio purist.  The fact that it won't run anything is a real bummer.  Even worse is the fact that when I want to listen to music, it gets stuck in the "listen to the song but can't hear the lyrics" loop.  If it weren't for the "upgrading" to a better device, I would just give up on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace a very poor iPod that was in a car accident. The first week, I used it to copy my old CDs and then discovered that there was no headphone jack so I couldn't listen to music without using the auxiliary input. After a week of that, I gave up on using it as a computer and threw it out. I don't think that it is even worth the $50, but it was an interesting experiment anyway.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this    I got an extremely expensive item I could have purchased from someone else for about a hundred dollars less.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an electronic device designed for use in a computer. However, after using it to copy a file from a computer to a drive, I discovered the USB port does not charge. When I plugged in the USB drive, the device powered off and never charged. I replaced the device and the problem occurred.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got my new   Dell   about a week ago,   and   immediately   found the power adapter to be   defective.   The adapter would not charge,  and had to be plugged into a usb port.  I   contacted Dell,  but   they would not   give me any information   on the problem.  In   the mean time   my   original   laptop would not power on.  It was   about this time 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is one of the worst electronic devices I've ever bought.   It has no internal SD card, and no way to access the internet using the included USB cable.  The interface and the interface cards are both non-standard, and the included CD is non-working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using an HP Touchpad with my laptop for over a year now, and I have to say, I'm not a fan.  It has very poor battery life and poor functionality.  The touchpad only goes about 1/3 of the way when you press down.  I find myself retyping the same key every time I need to start a new program.   The buttons on the touchpad don't work right, either.  And when you close a program, the touch pad and laptop start to get hot and feel like they're about to overheat.  In short, the HP TouchPad is a waste of money, and you'll be wasting your time and money unless you need to access your computer on your lap.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is very annoying to be able to write on a micro SD card and then have it formatted to a standard 2.5" hard drive.   The SD card was bad.  The memory card was not bad. I have an old Mac that can only read SD cards at very slow speeds.  My phone has a full SD card so this isn't an issue for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took me two weeks to get it, because of bad information on the site.  After buying a new printer, I was looking for a good scanner.  I found this thing on Amazon and read a review, saying the scanner was only a copy of the printer.  A copy of a printer would have been $99, plus shipping.  It would have cost me about $60 plus tax.  Not really worth it.   I ordered it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is horrible.   The card reader on this thing is really small.  It has so many things on it that it becomes useless.  The microSD card slot is not big enough to be anything useful.  My phone and camera work fine with this card.  I use the microSD slot for my camera as well as my phone.  In the past few months my phone has become really weak so this little card slot seems like a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this a year and a half ago as a "one-time purchase" for a very special occasion. Unfortunately, I've been having a lot of trouble getting the software to run for more than a few minutes, and when it does, the computer shuts down.   This is due to the fact that there is only a single USB port in my laptop, and most computers have more than one.  I've looked in all of my other laptops for other USB ports but they are all different sizes or configurations, and none of them has one USB port on the back, so I'm out of luck.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A dead hard drive from 2007?   This drive would probably last longer if the data was stored in a RAID 5 or 10 drive, instead of in a single hard drive.   There is no software to recover deleted data from a hard drive, even when it is erased.  It would probably take months to recover the data, and you might even need a RAID card to do so.  For that reason, I wouldn't recommend buying one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the G4 Cube as a replacement for my old 2nd generation iPod, and the Cube has so many problems that I cannot even use it.  I had to buy a 1st generation iPod Touch as a backup  (  It works perfectly  )  The main problem is that the interface is designed for the older iPod, so you have to hold the iPod in your hands to play songs and change songs, instead of having the interface be one that works in your hand.  The Cube also doesn't allow you to browse your music library, and it keeps loading up the same crap over and over.  It also crashes more often.  As for the sound, it's okay, but not great.  My iPod sounds way better than this  ( I was using my older iPod Touch )  I really can't recommend this device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is a disaster.  It came with a dead SD card and doesn't support any card format that I know of.  The batteries are extremely small and easily drop out.  I bought these things to use with a Canon 7D, but I had to return it because they don't work with it.  So, I'm stuck with this camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was my first time buying a DVR and I am very satisfied.  I purchased the dvr because my cable company was going out of business and I wanted to watch all of the old shows on Hulu.  The device worked flawlessly for the first week or so.  After that I found that the software did not always play the shows I wanted it to.  Fortunately, I have the ability to switch my device to another mode, which eliminates the need to reset the DVR every few days.  But after two weeks I'm still having problems with the software not playing my desired content.  And, for the money, I expect better performance.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have the mikroBUS 2 device that has the ability to connect to my old, dead  MP3 player  and send it to a PC using the PC's USB port, as well as sync with a phone and listen to music from that device using an iPod connection.   When the mikerBUS 2 was first released, I thought it was great and it was very good at what it was supposed to do.  The problem is that it never actually came with any drivers or software for my older MP3, so when I plug in my newer MP3 players, I get the following error:  The MikerBUS device is not supported by this MP3 device   The error seems to come about because my older player is an old, out-of-warranty model and was never supported by the driver/software provided by mikerbus.com.  This was a bit of a disappointment, as I had hoped to use the MikerBus with my newer, reliable MP3 devices, but I'm still trying to find an alternative to the Mikers.  I'm really going to have to take a chance and get something different.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for a new laptop. I use this laptop with a cheap USB 2.0 card that was shipped with the computer.  I don't use the card, so I wanted to know how it would perform.  The card is very unreliable.  When the computer is cold it doesn't work.  Sometimes it works when it is hot, but it isn't reliable for anything else.  It just stops working.  To be fair, this isn't a big deal.  Most people buy this kind of card for use with their computers and don't need to use it for music or movies.  But I've purchased this exact same card for my computer and I've always had the same problems.  This time I finally gave up and I haven't looked back since. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product is a total failure.  I had bought it for use with an old video camera, and I used it on it in order to get good pictures.  However, when the camera started to malfunction, the unit just stopped working.   When I attempted to use it with my cell phone, the video screen would go blank, and then turn back on, but then the phone would crash.  After multiple attempts, I gave up.  It's probably a defective unit.

When I first got it, I plugged it in and it said that there was no usb-c power port available. I took it back to the store, where I finally got it to work. But, even after I installed the proper drivers, I could never get it to record any audio. I tried every usb port and every card reader I could find. I've tried different USB cables, too. Finally, I gave up and went for my cheapo headphones.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got my Xbee XMax in May, and so far the quality is amazing. I have had mine for about a year, and have never had a single problem with it.   One problem, which is really annoying, is that when a WiFi signal is weak, the XBee XMax will lock up and be unable to connect to anything for over an hour or two (even when the Xbee is powered down).  This is frustrating, but at least the XMax works when WiFi is strong.  It's also been extremely frustrating when WiFi signal strength isn't very strong and you're in a bad location with no wifi access, and the Xbeam can't connect, even when powered down.  The other thing that bothers me is that if you want the XBeam to power on even if the wifi signal is down, you have to set up your home wifi.  If you don't do this, the first Xbeam you get won't work.  This would be a huge problem if the Xbeams in my house had to run off my computer's wifi connection, but they don't.  So, if I get another Xbeam, I'll probably set up my home wifi so that it's always up, even if I'm at my desk.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The S6 Edge is a beautiful device, but it has a very annoying thing. It uses a micro USB connector that can't be used with adapters.  One of my adapters had a cable that is 3.5mm, so I bought a micro-USB to 3.0 cable and it worked, but the S6 still won't recognize it.   So, I bought another adapter, but this one is for micro-SD card, not micro USB.  The adapter worked.  I bought the camera app for it so I can take pictures on the go.  It works great.  But when I use the camera it freezes randomly.  There's no video and all I get is "S6 Edge not connected to the internet."  The phone needs to be connected to an outlet so I'm not fumbling with a connector that I don't want.  So in the end, I just returned the phone.

I couldn't even start a video and it took forever to download it to my phone. I thought maybe it had something to do with my Internet provider.

The third time I attempted to use it, it kept failing completely, and I decided to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I don't understand why the "digital" flash is on by default.  I do most of my work with my camera on my computer so I can capture high quality pictures.  This means that if I am using the camera's flash to take photos, I'm only using about one-third of the flash's output power.  At times it's so much that the flash is almost "too much" to use.  Sometimes I'll have to turn the flash off in order to get decent pictures (this is especially true with my cheap flashgun)  The thing is, that I could just as easily have used my camera's built-in flash, which is what most photographers do, anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod shuffle is pretty bad.  It is always running at max volume, even when it is not in use.  And it can't record anything.  Even if the shuffle is not the main problem, I have to say that this was my main problem with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently got the new iPhoto on my iPhone, and i'm not too thrilled with it.   The pictures come out blurry or have a lot of noise.  They also are not that detailed.  I don't think i'll be buying the new version of the iPhoto anytime soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first bought this I was super excited, because it had great reviews. But, it didn't work. After 2 weeks it started working again but only when connected to an   iPad,  and I have only two of those. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Poor quality plastic!   It takes up a lot of space in the case, and the USB connector doesn't fit at all.  It's so much plastic that you can hardly tell it's an SD card reader.   I also lost the charger, which would have been helpful. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace my iPod which was becoming brittle over the years. However, it doesn't work properly, and it's a pain to return the defective item. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great sounding speaker. It is however, a very poor value.   It is louder than most other speakers on the market, and at the same time, it is also more than twice as expensive.  The build quality is average. The material used to assemble the parts is thin.  It would have been nice if this was possible for the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the first and only time that I have ever had any kind of electronic device fail within a year.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this unit because I had a high pitched "hum" at night which I thought might be my sound card failing. It turns out it's a cheap audio card that has failed.  The sound is still good, but the "humming" and crackling noises are back.  I've also had to deal with cheap headphones which were way too cheap to be worth using

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After upgrading to an external battery I was very disappointed in the performance of the external battery. The original device would hold a charge but would go dead at a certain point without warning.  The new battery was fine for about a week then it would shut off.  It is not possible to charge a LiPo while it is running unless you remove it from the charger and plug it back in

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The  iStick is a dud for the price.  It has a 2.5 amp battery which is less than the 3.5 amps of the better  portable players.  Also  there is a problem with the  cord going to the headphone amp when  connecting the player to the  laptop or desktop.  This is a very  expensive  product.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really wanted to like the Logitech USB 3.0 Mouse and Keyboard I purchased to replace my older Logitech keyboards and mice, but I really can't find a single good thing about it.  For $49 plus shipping I get an    Really bad   terrible   cheap   thing   that   has   some   good  features   but  doesn't   have   the   feature   necessary   to   make   a   worthwhile   purchase  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was excited when my local Best Buy opened a display model of the Apple TV 3:  The TV itself was a good buy at around $200.  But the remote was a deal breaker.  The remote is a plastic, cheap looking, awful looking set of keys that has an LED light to indicate when you've pressed a button.  It works fine.  I've never had any issue with it.  When I use the remote to control the Apple television, it gives me a lot of confusion.  In some cases, I can't select a channel from the television, and in other cases I get a blank screen.  That's all I can really ask for, but if I could use my computer as a remote, I would. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the M.O.X. 2 for a M.S.H. camera. It took about 2 weeks to get it because of the very slow response. When I finally got the MOLOS 2, I was very happy to use it. It works well with my M.H camera (the one from M.L.I.N.G). The 2-way switch is great for use with my Canon Rebel T2i, since my DSLR has a 2-in-1 mode that allows me to use either the camera or the M/L device simultaneously. I do not have an SD card reader, but I purchased a cheap one anyway. I haven't had to use the SD card for anything yet. I like the quality of the MELCO, but the MO. X. 2 is much more convenient.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device because my   USB   adapter   was failing. I   used the dongle   from   another   computer   but   it   broke   when   connected to   the   new   dongles.   So  I  was  really  disappointed   that   this   device   is   made   by   a  company   whose   products   have   been   poor   for   too  long   on

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device to connect my phone and watch the TV at the same time. However, the set top box never worked at all. It kept freezing or rebooting.  I had to resort to hooking up an external device to my TV and then connecting the cable for my phone to my PC.  The set top device also has the irritating habit of disconnecting randomly during an episode of something like Sesame Street. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPod classic's "flash" media player (which holds a single copy of the video or audio file) is the absolute WORST I have ever used.  It plays every file ever made, at random.  You have to play the video/audio file to see the play symbol.  I've tried many other iPods, but I will never buy another one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a Samsung Smart TV at Best Buy last November for $300.   It had the best picture and sound I had ever seen, but it required a lot of power and kept going out of battery.  After watching two or three hours of my favorite TV series and movies, I had to get the AC adapter to put it on my car.  It cost about $20 to replace the batteries.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very pleased with the first iPod Touch I bought, but the last 2 have been so much worse than the first that I've had to return them.  The speakers are weak, the batteries last about 1/2 hour, and it can't make phone calls.  Even if you can't call, it's just as easy to send text messages on a 4G connection. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is bad.   The only reason I kept it was because I knew my car could never go without an Ipod/MP3 player (especially when I don't listen to music and drive everywhere).  It's basically a glorified CD player with a crappy speaker system.  The sound is so bad I had to turn up my car's audio to drown it out.  No CD player will ever sound as bad as this thing.  Even when I tried to use a CD player to playback my iPod music, it still sounded terrible.  It would occasionally work with the latest podcasts, but only when I had the car in park.  All the rest of the time, the sound was horrible.  If you want to listen to the news while driving, you're better off just using an Ipad or a smartphone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my  Sony ICF-D100 that I lost in a house fire.  I thought the ICF was great and had great quality.  This one was even better.  It just isn't quite the same.  They seem a little loose and loose with battery life.  At one point it stopped working and I had to spend about 3 hours just trying to get it to come back on.  My Sony will last about 4 or 5 more years and the  A5X  is only about 2 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the  Panasonic HC-SR10 camcorder to use as my main video camera and recorder.   It works pretty well, but it has one major drawback:  While recording video, the power supply is so weak it won't accept any more power, leaving me stuck at 2.5V for over an hour every night while trying to record and/or shoot a video.  When using it as a camera, I get excellent picture quality (at least, it's better than the crappy video on my cell phone), but when recording, the lack of power completely ruins the recording. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit I purchased did not include any adapters.   I found a couple of other vendors on the web that did, and I am now waiting for a replacement to arrive.  I've never had such a bad experience with any electronic device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The original version of the Touchstone is a good piece of gear, but it was extremely annoying and difficult to use. It's now impossible to use without a big screwdriver, and after replacing the keyboard, the TouchStone is almost impossible to even get the keyboard off. The new keyboard has no screws, so the Touch Stones are going to be very hard to replace.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem is the internal flash memory is unreliable.  I've had two instances where the memory failed to write to the SD card.  It's hard to use it because it doesn't always work.  The SD card doesn't stick at all when you insert the card, but if you have to delete something, it does so.   If you get this as a gift, consider upgrading it to a higher capacity drive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It worked great until I accidentally turned it on to charge the  iPod.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my Sony Walkman, but my Walkman doesn't have any kind of headphone jack. So, I decided to buy this adapter. However, I found out that it has two different kinds of connectors. One is the standard "microphone" (more like a small speakerphone) connector, while the other one is the jack used for audio from external devices such as a camera.  It's not clear which is which.  The thing that bothers me is that if you want to use the external microphone to your Walkman from another device, you need to purchase a separate adapter to connect to the jack on the Walkman.  Also, it's very hard to use without getting your headphones wet.  I've tried it with my earbuds.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this over the weekend to backup my iPod, which I haven't had for years.  I figured I'd check out the features first.  When it was finished, I ran into a huge problem:  I can't copy music from my iPod to my hard drive because it doesn't recognize the file.   It can be copied to my PC or another iPod or flash drive, but not to the hard drive.  It doesn't even recognize my iPod's media files, which is why I had to download them separately.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst digital camera I've ever used.  I use it for photography and video.  The camera is so badly designed that it almost forces me to use my iPhone for everything I want to take with me.  There's no way to take a picture on the go that doesn't have the slightest bit of blur, even on a fast lens.  It will even give me "jello" effect when I put it next to my iPhone while recording.  My iPhone 3G does this with no problems.  For what it's worth, I don't think it's the camera that's the problem.

If you've used a PC mouse, you'll recognize this as a problem in design.  I've tried several mice, and these aren't nearly as bad as the old mice.  Even so, the XENONS seem like a better product, especially in the US.

I thought it would be a nice upgrade over my old cable that I have to take out everytime I plug in the cable.  But, the thing I hate most about it is the fact that it is so easy to lose the cables.  The first time I lost the cable, I had to walk back to my office to find the second one.  If this thing was a little cheaper I'd gladly give it a try, but then I would have to find somewhere to put my second cable in the next time.

This is my first USB device in the digital age, and I thought it would be a good way to transfer files between my computer and my iPod. I expected it to have similar performance to my older Mac.  Instead, I got what I expected: slow transfer speeds, poor video, and poor sound quality.

I have an  iPod, a Sony player and an iPhone and each one has survived numerous uses with no problems.  The only other thing I can think of is that it may not be able to handle the digital data storage and playing of music, as there is no way to remove it from the device for use on other devices. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the WPA2/PSK2 card reader and was very happy with the device when it came in, but soon after the card reader stopped working. The reader would not detect the WPS/PS KID card, but would allow the card to be read by other cards. The other card reader would also work fine with the card, and this one had been fine before, so I figured it must have just been one of the two cards. When I removed the card from the other reader, the device still would not recognize it. This caused me to reorder a new card reader, which I'm still waiting for.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My 3rd one   I'm using it for music.   It has to be turned on and off by the user to work properly.  I don't understand why the manufacturer thinks we are stupid 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device is very good at what it is supposed to do.  The only problem is that it makes the sound that came out of the speaker very muffled.  It's very annoying and makes playing music very difficult.  I tried other Bluetooth devices that made the sound better and had no problem, but the RCA jack is very difficult to work with. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After I bought this thing, I was so excited to use it for my PC. Unfortunately, it broke after a month. It took a lot to get this thing to work correctly. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is way overpriced.  I tried to upgrade my old HD to the 2.0 one, but it did not work.  Also, it does not support a 4K video.  It would have been a great buy if only it had been $20 less.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First I was a little disappointed when I got my new iPod after buying an iPhone.  I had heard so much good about it from so many other reviewers that I thought it would be perfect!  When it finally came, I found that it wasn't as good as I'd thought.   It had a couple of problems:  1. The battery life was not as good.  It lasted less than half a hour and then gave out.  2. The microphone and remote were not great.  The remote was noisy and had issues with voice recognition.  My only redeeming quality was that I got a free one from another iPod. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It seems to have very bad noise canceling. It makes the TV (with audio) sound like it's in my living room, and the speakers sound like they're in my bedroom. This really sucks!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new iPad 3 at Best Buy on January 8, 2012. It arrived on January 11, 2012 and the iPad worked fine on the first day but on the second day, it froze up completely and would not turn back on. I tried three times to reset it by going into the iTunes settings and selecting reset. It refused to do so.  It would not even allow me to use it as a USB thumb drive.   After several days of trying to reset my device, I finally gave up and replaced it with a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this to replace an old external hard drive.   It works fine, except that the drive is very noisy when I run it at high speed.  I could turn it down a little, but the noise would come back.  It also runs faster than I expected, especially when I'm copying a bunch of files from one hard drive to another. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is one of the most expensive wireless cards out there.   It's basically the only card in its class available at this price point.  It can't connect to any of my laptops or desktop computers due to incompatibility with the wireless protocols they use.  Even worse, it can't support older wireless routers and other devices that use proprietary protocols.  If it worked with my old routers, it would be an inexpensive and easy upgrade. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a good unit and works well, but the cable comes out as if it was hit hard on something hard.  I tried to use it again and it didn't work, so I returned it to the store and got a different one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I tried to use the TNA-200, I was very disappointed.  I plugged it into my TV, and got no sound.  In fact, it just made the sound of my TV on.  It sounded just like a regular TV speaker.  Then I went online and searched for a good TNA speaker. I decided on the Sony XAV-W900X and it has some very good reviews.  So I bought the XAV, and I must say that it is pretty much perfect.   It comes with a USB cable and a USB drive that can be used to record shows.  The TNA is about as good as it gets, so I decided to give it a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been looking for a good external drive for a long time, but nothing fits my need.  This thing is amazing!  It holds my most important things, including the latest versions of my programs and games, all safely and securely, in the flash drive that I'm carrying with me everywhere.  I haven't had an issue at all with this drive in the last couple of years.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the D-Link Smart Plug for my Sonos Receiver.  The first one I purchased was broken.  This is the second one and I don't know why they didn't just use the ones available on the market.  There are so many other options for connecting the Sonos.  I love the simplicity of the Smart Plug.  It has a very good quality plastic case and everything works fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using this little guy for about a week now.  The good:  It works great.  You have to plug it in, but that's OK.  It's very low power, so you can put a lot on the screen.  Not all LCDs have that much power, and I like them that way.  But this LCD isn't perfect.  For example, in Windows, I can't seem to resize the font in any way. It just stays fixed to the size of the text.  I can resize the text, but I can never make it larger than the normal size of my screen. It's frustrating.  Also, the volume button doesn't work.  Even though the volume is set to full-size, it always stays at full-sized.  Finally, I'm just not convinced by the warranty.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my old iPod, and it's not even close.   The volume and the quality of the sound are terrible.  The sound comes out of my speakers with a crackle and pops.  My old iPod sound better than this.  I've owned all kinds of music players, from digital to analog to CD.  This is by far the worst I've ever used. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This electronic device is junk   The sound quality is so-so, and the only thing that works is a bluetooth speaker. The screen is just a piece of plastic with a weak screen protector.  The design is crap and the battery is no good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Bought this to use with my Nikon D90. When I received it, I set it up on the computer and all of the functions were functional, however the shutter release didn't work at all. It only did the shutter, not the lock. When trying to lock the shutter at any time during the frame, the device would simply lock up, forcing you to reset.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a piece of junk.  The only thing that keeps it from being a total failure is the fact that it's supposed to be a game controller.  When it gets lost, you have to replace the whole thing.   So the only way you could use this product is if you were an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a Digilent DIR-800N in early August to replace my aging Powermac G3.  It was about as fast as my old Powermac but far more expensive.  I was looking at a Mac mini, not a Macbook, but I decided to go ahead and get the 8-core DIR.  Unfortunately, I had bought the wrong memory and it was slow.  When I finally got it running, I found out that the 8 cores are in a PCIe x2 slot, not PCIe x4.   So, after a couple of months of using the 8D, I upgraded to the 16D for about $50 more.  While it is a nice, more powerful computer than my Powermac, it's not worth the price increase. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 to replace an old Note 2. I've never had any problems with the original Note 2, and have been using it ever since I purchased it (2009).   But the original Samsung Galaxy S4 has been replaced twice by my wireless carriers, and I have yet to receive a new one.  I have a great deal of faith in Samsung as a vendor, and am hoping that the Note 3 will be just as reliable as the original.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this so that I could stream a high definition video from my Xbox One to my Samsung TV.  Unfortunately, I have had some issues with the video stream being so choppy and my TV's signal being so weak.  I've been able to get some pretty good picture on my Samsung's, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen.  It looks like someone took a large computer motherboard and cut out all of the parts that were supposed to make it work well (video signal, analog audio, and the actual computer). 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price of the T.E.D. has gone up to around $200 recently and if you want to have a good quality tape-based recorder, the TDA-2000 is a great deal.  I love the fact that it has a memory card slot and the ability to record from multiple sources at once.  It also lets you connect external drives without having to buy a separate adapter.  Unfortunately, however, there are several flaws in the unit.   First, the unit has a tendency to overheat when playing a lot of data in a short period of time.  You can compensate for this by setting the volume to a moderate level, but even then it will occasionally start to skip.  The recorder also has a habit of skipping data when a user is using the recorder.  This issue can be fixed by taking the unit out and re-booting it several times, but it seems like the unit just has an issue with the TTR file format.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The Epson printer I bought from Best Buy is unusable. The inkjet is so badly scratched I can't even use it to print a sheet of paper.  This printer has been returned 4 times for defective items: the toner cartridges are defective; the card reader is defective; and the printer is defective (the toner cartridge jams up on the card readers).  I can only assume that Best Buy's quality control staff is so overwhelmed with the volume of returned units that they're leaving out defective items. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are several issues that are frustrating:  1. The "Smart" mode seems to be working very well so far (the original firmware was buggy). However, when I try to power on my SD card, the "Smart Mode" fails.  2.  I have to "reload" the card a couple of times before it works, even though it is supposed to work.   3. When I want to get rid of a file, I must reboot the system to delete the file.  This is very annoying.  4.  The internal camera is not very useful.  If I want more than one picture, I have the option of taking pictures of different areas of the screen.  However, the pictures are blurry and not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the Panasonic Toughbook after looking at the specs for the Samsung 2.5" hard drives I wanted to use with my Sony PS3 (not having the Sony PS2). The Panasonic Toughbooks had good specs, and my Sony is a bit bigger and more than a little bit faster.  They also had a 3 year warranty and it seemed like good value.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be a dud.  The hard drives and the computer would not boot, and when I tried to boot the PS3, the hard drive froze up.  I called Sony to find out what was wrong, and they said that a bad solder joint existed in the hard disk drive controller.  It was too expensive to replace the hard disks, so they offered to send me a refurbished hard disk that they claim works much better than the original.  That's not what I got, however.  When I plugged in the refurbished disk, the PS2 would boot, but the hard drives would not work.   The only way to get the PS 2 to work was to remove the hard discs, and then put them back in the PS, and boot from that.  Eventually, the original hard disk in the Sony that I purchased would run, but my new hard disks would not.  In summary, the Toughbooks are very nice devices, but I did not get a good deal.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product itself is fine. It does what I needed it to do. The problem is the cable. It's very cheap, and I can't see any way to fix it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought the Digipak, I was very interested in getting a small iPod for traveling. When I got it, I discovered that it could only hold about 20-30 songs. I could hold no more music when I had to take my car for a night of driving. I then got a larger model, and it was much more convenient. It could hold more than 100 songs. But that also meant I had much more storage space.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a bad experience with this product. First of all, it was very, very cheap. A brand new computer is twice as expensive as this device, which is an average $50 computer. I was using it to run a Linux VM and that proved to be a little problematic. I had the disk partitioning software from an inexpensive laptop installed. When I tried to use the disk to install the operating system, it gave me a file error. I ended up installing the OS from a CD and that did the trick. I bought another one of these for a Windows virtual machine.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just got this to use for my MP3 player. After trying it out, I can only conclude that the quality is the lowest on the market.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a way to get around Apple's restrictions on the use of media and USB drives in the iMac.  It works fine until you plug it in to the computer and try to play a DVD or CD.  If you try to use it like that in a Windows computer or Mac, it'll turn on with the warning:  "A device driver has been installed in the device."   To remove it, you have to remove the CD and/or DVD drive and run an "uninstaller" from the Apple Web site.  I was hoping that this would solve my problem.  But it didn't.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to use with my MacBook Air. Unfortunately, it didn't work at all.

I've tried several different audio and video formats on the iPod touch and they all don't work. It took me 3 days to get it working after I tried various methods on a couple of different models. The other thing I found is that the iPod is very expensive when compared to the iPod mini. It's about twice as much for the same capacity, and I'm not sure it's worth the price difference.

My card reader had taken forever to read.  The USB port was also unreliable.  Finally, the battery seems to be about 1 year old.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just bought a Sony XBR-X1000 which includes all of the software necessary to work on my new X-Pro1. I got it working in under 30 seconds using Sony's excellent media manager. However, it will not open the X-10 software. It won't even read any of the data files. It says that the media is too large to read so it must be compressed using a lossy codec. I'm using this camera in an ISO-1600 mode and in this mode it works fine. I haven't tried any other settings in the X10 software as I've never had any trouble using it in other settings. This camera is supposed to be the fastest camera in the world, but it's actually very bad at reading and processing media, so I'm not going to be putting any more time into it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It arrived with a couple of scratches, but that was expected. It took me a couple days to open it up because I was afraid of damaging my expensive Sony camera. But that was fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item was defective, and not just the price tag is wrong on this particular camera.  It has a camera built in, but not the one it's supposed to have.   The original camera had no memory card slot, so it has to be plugged in to take pictures.  The second camera is for the electronic interface, which is fine for the video portion, but it is terrible for taking pictures.   I bought the camera and adapter because it was so low priced, and I was extremely disappointed when it didn't work as advertised. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my son and he loved it. The quality of the device is much better than the previous ones I purchased.  The USB port was unusable for a few weeks after I used it for his computer.  I had to return it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPod 3G has many drawbacks, but there is one feature that is particularly awful, and that is the ability to create a copy of your music when you buy a new iPod.   In order to make this work, you have to buy a separate device called a "Smart Card" which allows you to copy your music to the iPod 3g when you download it from iTunes.  It costs about $10, and it will save you a lot of time and money.  Unfortunately, that card can't be used to copy music to other iPods (because of copyright issues).  Even worse, the Smart Card can only work with a single iPod, and only if the other one is already in your possession.  If you try to copy a copy from a new to old iPod, you'll get an error message like this:  When I tried to copy from my iPod 2G to an iPod 3, it reported:  Unable to Copy iTunes Match (cannot find matching version)    It also has trouble reading some older DVDs  (for the same reason).   This may be a deal breaker for some, but my biggest problem with the iPod is the inability to copy to the 3G

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are some things about the Epson S7000 that just make you want to throw it in the garbage.  For one thing, it has no built in DVD player.  It doesn't play video on any of the DVDs it comes with, and even if you put the discs in, it doesn't read the discs properly.  If you want DVD playback, you need a CD burner, which can run about $20.  The S7200 also doesn't come with an external DVD burner, so you have to buy one separately.  As for digital cameras and scanners, these are great, but there's no way they can do the job on a single page of paper.  I'd much rather use my laptop and carry my camera around with me, but I also have to carry the S7100 around with it.  That's probably the only thing that really irritates me about the S-7100:  It just makes carrying around an expensive piece of hardware for more than a month really annoying.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used several "pro" brand digital cameras, and I'm always impressed by how well they perform. The problem, however, is that the "pros" end up costing about 2-3 times what the "basics" cost.  In my case, I paid $600 for the camera (with lens and two memory cards), but they came with a lens for only $120.  I ended up buying a cheap lens and a cheap memory card just to get by.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these units as replacements for the defective units I had received from another company. I tried using the original units and then bought these units with great expectation.    However, the original unit was defective in at least two ways: 1) the screen always dims to almost nothing when it is not showing anything.  2) the batteries failed after about a year or so.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product is ok, but the cables are not.  The two plugs on one end (one for the mains, one for the TV) are made of plastic and are cheap and cheaply made.  I use an AC adapter to plug into a powered mains plug, so the one plug to go to the TV is not really necessary.  Another issue with the mA adapter, which I can see is why other reviews mention it being cheap, is that it's a tad too short.  So you have to put a piece of tape on the end of it to keep it in place.  It also doesn't plug into the other end of the cable like it should, so I have to turn the adapter on first to connect it to the mab.  Finally, the cable is too thin.  If you have a better mA/Mab combo, these will last a lot longer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really needed this for my TV. I bought it and it was useless. It wouldn't recognize my TV in any way. The only way I could find to get it to recognize my tv was to make it write the name of the TV on it's LCD screen and then write an exclamation point on that and then it would recognize it. That's about all it could do. After that, I could see my TV just fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The CD player has a loud buzzing sound that I can hear while I'm listening.  I can't say for sure if this is due to defective components or something else, but the buzzing is very annoying.  It also causes the music to be too distorted at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The original Sony Playstation 1 has a huge problem: It always has issues when transferring data over to a new system. It often runs into problems with the CD drive and with the "formatting" software, which is essential for transferring data. The original Playstation 1 is also a little slow. It can't run my copy of the latest Tomb Raider on it, for instance. Both of these problems can be fixed with some simple software.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing wrong with this product is that it has a weird, very unpleasant plastic casing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product worked perfectly until I tried to copy an SD card to my N64. When I inserted it, the card read correctly but the software that was supposed to copy it never came. It did not come in either.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this unit in October 2007 to replace my iPod Classic. This unit was a huge improvement over the iPod, with features like GPS and GPS-enabled music. I'm happy I got this unit, but now it's getting harder and harder to find music I like to listen to. Now I get all my music from the Internet, and am using my iPod's as my music player.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone works fine, but the software is just so bad.  It gives no indication of the date when a call was made.  I had to enter it manually just to make sure that the date was correct.  When I tried to call my sister, I got a "Call-Received: no signal" message every time.  No matter how long I waited, I couldn't get the connection.  Eventually I had it set to automatically connect to the AT&T cell network.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After purchasing the E-WasteCaddy, I was very pleased. However, after several months, the USB cable failed and I was unable to retrieve data from the ENC drives. The E-wasteCaddies are not sealed and could very well be a source of contamination. The USB cable could not have been made of better quality materials, and it took a long time for my computer to recognize the device as an ENC drive.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was really excited about this toy when it first came out but it's so disappointing that I just can't recommend it.  First of all, the price was great but when I got it I noticed that it was just a plastic vibrator, no batteries and not waterproof.  When I tried it the toy wouldn't turn on.  It had a cheap plastic body, not much else.  I found that after about 30 minutes the toy just stopped working.  Not because the batteries were running low but because the power source was just not powerful enough.  Even my partner's vibrator is much more powerful than this toy so I don't think it's a huge deal.  And because it's plastic, it's much more likely to break than an actual rechargeable toy.  The packaging also came with a very unprofessional picture, I'm not sure why it was included in the first place.  Overall, it was a pretty crappy purchase and I'm considering going back to my old rechargeable vibrator. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My son's birthday present for Christmas was the Philips iConnect Maven 4.0.  The unit is very cute and was a great value for the money.  However, there were problems.   A couple of days after receiving the unit, I noticed a small vibration when playing music.  I've been using a wireless Bluetooth speaker and headphones and the sound is much better with Bluetooth.  My daughter, who is a fan of Bluetooth music, said the same thing.  Another day, I couldn't connect to the unit at all.  There were no problems with the original unit, so I'm thinking the unit must have failed.  It's so frustrating because I have had the same issue with the unit I bought four years ago.  Hopefully, the company will work out the problems.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really like the design of this iPod, but it has one big downside: the buttons are not touch sensitive. You can click on anything and move the cursor and music will play. I had to use the back and forth key to move through all my songs. The problem is that you can't press down to skip back one song because the next one starts automatically. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device has several significant flaws: 1.   The USB connector used is very loose.  It doesn't go all the way to the back of the device.  Also, the cable it comes with is very short.  2.  The cable has a bad connection at the top.  At best, the connection breaks on the USB port, and at worst it tears the cable out.  3.  A very small piece of the cable is attached to the USB hub with plastic.  This can sometimes cause the hub to become "sticky."  This could lead to a total failure of the hub or, more likely, damage to the hub.  4.  Because the hub is connected by the USB connector, the USB cord is very flexible.  You will be tempted to use it to get at the other end of the USB cable.  Unfortunately, it will be extremely difficult to do so because the cord is so thin.  5.  If you do use the cord, the cord itself will be weak.  I have had cables that were literally ripped out of the socket by this cord.  That's just unacceptable for a device that is supposed to be used to store digital photos and videos.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my aging Dell laptop.   First of all, it sucks.  It's so bad that I was able to run it at full speed only 2 or 3 times before I stopped.  The hard drive was also full when I bought it, so that's another thing I'd rate lower.  And it was the only thing that made this laptop unusable.  There's no USB port so you have to use a hard drive.  So I lost the ability to use it as a media player.  I also lost the CD drive. The mouse is useless since you have a dedicated mouse with a built-in trackball.  After that, you're basically done.  If you want to use this as a workstation, you'll have to be okay with the bad RAM, bad hard drive, and the fact that you can't run most programs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really liked the design of this card reader, but I have had problems with both the card and the reader. Sometimes the reader will not let you insert the card, and sometimes the card will not read after the reader has been inserted. The card is really brittle (it bends like a paper clip) and is usually easy to break. The reader's cover is fragile, too, and almost always falls off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price is very good, and the performance is decent.   However,  the interface is a complete disaster and needs a full overhaul.  It's a simple enough interface, but it's slow and cumbersome to use.  Even a relatively fast USB 2.0 card can take hours to write.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My LG cell phone has a great feature: the ability to store your credit card info. I use it for a weekly shopping list.  Every time I enter my card number, the camera scans the card and shows me the charges in real time.   But, the feature doesn't work every time, so I have to keep going back to the camera every time I want to see my purchases.  It's a great convenience, but it can be inconvenient to use and it doesn't always work in real-time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been buying Apple products for many years but I finally decided to try the iPhone because the $499 price tag seemed too good to be true.  I'm glad I made the mistake.  The screen is just ok.  It has some image degradation that is noticeable in bright sunlight, but I can get by without it.   But the thing is, it's so cumbersome.  When it comes time to charge it, I have to unplug it from the wall and unplug my computer  I just can't get it to charge.  If it had an SD card slot, it would be a much better device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After being used to many of the more expensive iPods, I finally decided to give the MP3 Player a try.  I'd never heard of it until I was shopping at Radio Shack - but was excited by the price and the fact that they were available at such a good price.  Unfortunately, I soon discovered the MP4 Player to be inferior in every way to the iPod.  They don't play music very well; there are no auto-lock and shuffle features; the battery is very poor and not rechargeable; and the battery life is horrible.   The MP3 player comes with a nice case, and comes with two iPods; however, it's hard to listen to music with any of them.  It would be nice if it had a better player and if it included more songs in its library.

Other than that, it worked very well, and now I can transfer data to and from my phone over USB 3 with no problems.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the iPhone 6 and have to admit, I am disappointed. I had heard so many good things about it, so I figured I'd try one out.  After about 10 minutes using it, I noticed that it was very hard to operate, even on a high-powered device. The buttons don't respond properly, the speaker isn't very loud, and there is no microphone.  I can't really describe it other than it is very slow and difficult.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing that happened to my unit was the battery. It just died. I contacted Sony about this, and they suggested that I use a different charger.   This seems like a very simple thing to do, but apparently it's not.  After I got my replacement, I tested it again and found that the unit had another dead battery, so it had to be the same charger that I used.  The second thing that's happened is that it won't turn on at all.  I've been looking for other models of this to replace mine so I can get back to using my other Sony products.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the S-2 digital audio player and it has been useless in every way imaginable.  It has the worst sound quality I have ever heard from a digital device,  This is not just because I have a cheap mp3 player,  Even worse, the player has absolutely no ability to store audio.  This can be solved in many ways,  The most inexpensive solution I have found is to purchase an MP3 player with an SD card slot.  Once the card has been populated and copied to a new device, the MP3 can then be played directly without needing to convert it to a format that can be played on a digital player.  Unfortunately, my cheap mp can't handle a SD card, so I will be making the switch to my cheap player as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with the CD player on my new Samsung. The player plays a very small selection of music (e.g., songs on "Hannah Montana" and "American Pie") but most of the time it plays at a very slow speed. This makes playing movies and shows on the computer impossible.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I've had this thing since it came out.  After a few days of use, it started acting up, sending me lots of weird messages like "I need to be with you. I'm getting so lonely" or "I'm going to kill myself." The problem is, it doesn't matter how good of a device it is if it's not reliable. It also has a low battery warning light that glows red when it's low. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 for some time and I must say, it is a terrible phone.   The phone is very slow, has awful battery life and cannot hold a charge for very long.  It also has a horrible design that makes it extremely prone to dropping on the floor.  This phone has gotten worse over time, from the Galaxy S4 to the Note 4, to the Galaxy Note 3.  The last time I bought a Samsung phone was the S3.  I've been very happy with the S4, the S5 and the S6, but now, I am very disappointed in the Note 5 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product is very poorly designed.  The LCD screen is poorly designed, and has been prone to showing blank areas on many occasions.  It also shows an "off" condition on many of the time displays.  Although the battery life seems to be good, the USB port is a major weak point for this device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've been looking for a decent audio device for some time now, and I finally got my wish.  When I first opened up the packaging, I noticed that there was a pretty large SD card inside the case.  I assumed that the card was to hold the music files that the headphones output, but when I pulled the card out, I found the whole thing was filled with data!  I'm not a huge music fan, but I was curious as to how this card was going to hold all of the files for my personal collection.  After some googling, I learned that this kind of SD card is commonly used by MP3 players and portable media players.  It looks like I'll have to buy an SD card reader (like the kind that comes with the iPod ), so that I can transfer my music collection onto that card!  Overall, this is a really good product and a great price.

I was able to get it to work again only by getting a new cable to the iPod and then fiddling with it a bit. This time I managed to get the first pair working, but I was really disappointed to discover that they were the same price as the new set.  I am really disappointed in these products, 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As an electronic device, the N3 is an extremely frustrating device. The design is very nice (as many other recent reviews have mentioned) but I purchased a N2 for a different reason.   The N2 was one of the first devices I ever bought.  It was so cheap and worked so well that I could afford a couple of more, even though I was already a heavy user of older equipment.  I ended up with the N2's on eBay and never looked back.  The one I received today was a used unit, so I didn't have a chance to test it.  However, the poor performance and short battery life is a huge disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased an HP Touchpad a couple years ago and while it worked OK, it eventually wore out.  This latest version (8.1) doesn't.  It never works at all.   It constantly hangs or makes weird clicking noises.  The first time I turned it on, it failed to recognize my Macbook Pro (Late 2012) as a USB device.  Then it just refused to show up.  When I tried it with a USB 2.0 port, it also failed.  I've had it for two months, and it's still not working.  So I'm thinking I'm probably going to have to go out and get a brand-new one (assuming I can still find one at the bargain price).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In all my life, I have never seen an electronic device malfunction so completely and catastrophically.   It was extremely easy to install, and once I got the power up and running, it worked fine for about a week.  But then, suddenly, the internal speaker and microphone stopped working.  I tried rebooting the device, but that only made it worse.  Once again, I turned to the forums and tried to figure out what had gone wrong.  There was no mention of anyone having the same problem, and all the problems that seemed to be plaguing me appeared to be resolved.  Finally, I bought a different laptop and it worked flawlessly until a week or so later.  It just seems that this is a known problem with the product, and there are no easy solutions to such a problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is the best I have purchased.  It can transfer a huge amount of data in a short time.  If I need to copy a huge quantity of music, video, or photos to my laptop in a hurry, I just pull out the SD card and transfer it there.  Also, it has a good, strong sound, which is good for long distances.   I also like the ability to change the format of the data you are transferring from FAT to NTFS, even if the data is small (like an mp3). 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have purchased and returned a few of these things over the years. I find them to be unreliable at best.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A really nice and well designed device. I used it to store and retrieve the SD card of a video I shot from a friend's camcorder. The device's main drawback is the size. The SD card slots on the back of the device don't fit the SD cards I currently have in my camera. I was planning to use this device to capture video and stills of my camping trip, but it would be a pain in the rear to store all of the SD media.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone because I am a big fan of Android devices and I thought I would be able to get the most out of it.  Unfortunately, the only "features" that make this phone different from other Android phones is the lack of SD card slots, the lack-a-camera feature, the need for a contract and the lack the software support for Verizon.  The phone also doesn't work with my Verizon SIM card, so my only choice is to pay an extra $25 a month for the phone to work with a different SIM card.   If I was a Verizon customer, I would have been really upset to hear about the lacka-SD-card-slot feature, since this would have made the phone really useful for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very bad experience  I ordered the Sony a6300 from Amazon.com on July 28th. I received it on July 30th. The camera worked as advertised.

That's when I discovered that there was no record in the camera, and I could not transfer any of the photos taken to my a63xx camera. I contacted Sony, and they said that there is a problem with my camera, but they cannot fix it. They have no idea how this could happen, and cannot guarantee that my camera will work. I will never buy from Amazon again, even if the camera is free.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased an iPod mini for my wife to use in her car. When she got it she immediately complained that it was very difficult to sync it to the computer and also that it did not work. We attempted to do the "easy way", by using iTunes on her computer, but to no avail. The problem was that the iPod mini had a "backup disk" which was a copy of the original "boot disk" that the original iPod had. We tried it on a different computer and it works. We are having problems with my iPod mini. The last time it worked it was a few days before Christmas. The first problem I had was that it would not recognize my iPhone 4. I turned off all the bluetooth functions in iTunes and tried to sync. I ended up deleting the iPhone and iPod app from iTunes and reinstalling them. It did not solve the problem. Then, a few months later I purchased a new iPod and it worked perfectly. I will be switching to my iPhone in the near future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the iBook to replace my aging HP laptop that had become sluggish and hard to use.  I also needed a separate USB to mini-DVI adapter to use with the mini-dvie  I was using at the time.   My problem was that the mini dvie didn't come with a mini-b cable, but it was so small I couldn't find one.  After trying a few different ways to find a mini dvi cable, I finally found one at a local computer store.  It was so cheap, I was afraid it was defective.  So I plugged the device into my new laptop, and the iMac seemed to work perfectly!  However, the only thing I used it for was surfing the Internet.  The only time I used the iBooks was to check e-mail, and then it went to sleep.  Unfortunately, that meant I had to pay twice the cost of the ibook, and twice the price of the mini b cable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My Panasonic Toughbook has become a bit of a liability in my life.  It started out as just a nice portable hard drive.   Once my computer became infected with the "Greed worm" I ended up replacing all my other drives with my new Panasonic.  The new drives were fine for a couple of years, but eventually my computer started complaining about having to re-partition.  I was then told by my computer vendor that my Toughbook was fine, since it was brand new.  Unfortunately, it became necessary to send my unit in for repair after the computer finally failed (at least a week before I started having trouble).  It turns out that the "greed worm", which caused a corruption of the hard drive data, was somehow introduced through the keyboard and trackpad interface, since I was using a laptop during the time of the failure.  A new drive and a completely different keyboard and mouse are now needed.  This could've easily been avoided if I had just read the manual earlier (which is still online) or if my computer's manufacturer had updated the firmware.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's terrible. I bought it because it was the only one I could find that would allow me to sync my MP3s to my phone via USB. Unfortunately, it doesn't do that and the CD player that came with it also sucks. I purchased the device mainly for playing music. I've listened to most of the CDs I own on it and have had it for about a week.  I couldn't even use it to play CD's.  It just doesn't sound as good as my iPod, my Mac's CD player, or my Sony Walkman.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item to replace my old one that broke after 1 month. The new one works great, but the old one still works great. I've been using my cell phone for several years now, and I use my new phone less and less.  I don't want to spend $200 on a new cell phone, but I do need a backup, and these are a little too good to be true. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used my new Sony MDR-Z1R audio recorder (a Sony product) to record my son's piano recital at his new school.  The cassette tape used by the school was not good quality, and I was very worried that my son would be disappointed with the recording quality.  This recorder sounded just as good as the other audio cassettes used at the school.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I use my new  iPod Touch (   The only good thing is  that it has a headphone jack but the volume is a bit too low.   It doesn't matter when I'm listening to my MP3 music, so I guess that's a good thing.  The battery life sucks 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As expected, I had to return the original iDevice due to a hardware problem. I am very disappointed that this device did not perform as advertised.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device to do my music recording, but I could not use it. The remote, with its "back" button, would not control the CD player. Instead, it would just take a "pause" and "play" command. I bought a different Sony device to replace it, but that device does the same thing. I'm sorry Sony, but you really need to think about what people are going to do with these things. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently purchased this unit because I needed to have a spare digital camera to keep in the car.  After some searching, I found a used unit for less than half the price.  The unit arrived in good time, but it appears the USB port is not USB 2.0.  I have been able to plug it into my laptop to transfer pictures, but that is it.  If the port is USB 3.0, I am all for it, but until then I will have to use my digital camera for those rare moments when I have a moment of clarity and can see the images I took.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Purchased the E-MU0 for a few things, and it's a total disappointment.  It doesn't work properly.  I use my tablet with my Panasonic camera, so I have to use the e-mul to play MP3's.  This means that if I'm moving around, the eMU0 will fail to recognize I'm holding it.  In a pinch, I'll use my regular tablet, but this thing should be worthless.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only problem I have with my iPad 2 is the audio quality. I bought an Audio Technica ATR-50 card just to upgrade the iPod's audio quality, so I could use my iPhone to listen to the radio. Unfortunately, the new card only provides 16-bit/44.1kHz audio.  Even though the iPod works perfectly fine, the sound quality is poor.  I would have given this product a 5 star rating if the audio was acceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The SD card is really crappy. It doesn't always work when I want it to. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am a huge fan of the K-01 and the KA-00, and even the D-05, but these two are just so bad.  The KA's are so poorly built they are almost unusable, the KX's are like a half-baked product that just doesn't work properly, and the D's are just plain bad in every way possible.  They are even worse than my  iBook

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my old, unreliable, non-upgradeable  computer.  The battery life is good and there's no dead pixels.  Unfortunately, the camera fails to focus at all.  I'm not sure if that's a defect with the lens, or if it's just a software problem.  It's really annoying that the device is so poor that it's useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the DIGITAL PHONE because it allowed me to record my music.  I used it for about a week, and then the phone died after about 6 months.   It's an annoying habit, but the price is so low that I've accepted it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem is, I tried out this product and found it to be terrible. It's incredibly loud and has a high chance of overheating and melting the phone's screen. It also seems to have very poor battery life. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price is right for the quality, but the user interface is the worst I've ever encountered. It's difficult to find out what's wrong with a piece of equipment and how to fix it. The battery is so weak and the device so complicated that I had to return the unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a good USB adapter but not worth much.  The USB plugs are made by a company that has done a very poor job of customer service.  It would have been nice if I received a good one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using an iPod for a year.  The new iPod is fine, but the battery lasts maybe 4 hours before I need to recharge.  So I decided to get a new laptop instead.  When I was able to get my hands on a Dell, it was too big for my phone.   The battery lasted forever, but it took up a lot of space.  I am going to try a few different kinds of batteries this week. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After purchasing two Apple TV's to replace my aging TiVo, the first one just stopped working and the second refused to boot to tv or do anything else.   It's possible that it's just a bad piece of electronics, but I would have expected better from Apple.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The PnP-S1 is the most disappointing purchase I've ever made.  I've owned a lot of inexpensive consumer electronic devices over the years.  The first was a BCD player that was useless after a few years. The most disappointing of all was a TRS-80 Model 2 that I bought for about a hundred dollars back in the early 1980s.  It was a piece of junk and I never got around to replacing it.  My PnPs are also junk, as are the PnD-S2 and PnR-S3.  When I read about the PpS1, I thought I might find something that would work better than those crappy devices.  Unfortunately, all I can say is "Fuk uuuuuk." 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was the second and final purchase from this company. I was very disappointed in the performance of the first unit and it eventually became completely unresponsive after several months of use.  This time I was more positive about the quality of the product.  The first unit had a few problems (i.e. no volume control) that I wasn't happy about so I waited to see if it would improve.  It didn't and I returned it.  But then I got this one and read the reviews and I was even more unhappy.   The only problem I have with the unit is the microSD card reader.  I had to remove and replace it several times to get it to work correctly.  For this reason I don't recommend this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing sucks   After having it replaced twice, my brand new Sony A7S is still defective.  I know this because the manufacturer sent me a new unit that they knew I would love, so it has some great features, including an external battery and headphone jack.  However, the audio is terrible, especially the sound in the headphones.  They aren't even that good for a smartphone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The LCD has been showing black dots on some pictures for some time now.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First, the battery lasts only about three hours, which is a shame since it's supposed to give you more hours of use than that. Second, you can't change the batteries on this device and you have to buy new ones each time. I've purchased a lot of expensive electronic devices in the past that lasted forever. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A few days ago I used a new USB device to upgrade the hard drive on my old laptop. The new card came with a defective USB connection. The hard drive would only work with the original USB cable. So I used that old cable to connect it to my new card, and it worked fine. When I put the new card in, it wouldn't work either, but it was connected to the original cable.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my third digital camera.  I bought the Olympus E-PL1 and the Panasonic GF1.  It was always so bad.   I tried the Olympus GF1 but it always had a problem with the automatic ISO setting.  The Olympus E1 was much better, but I couldn't use the manual controls to adjust the ISO, which made it less accurate.  Even when I changed the ISO manually, it made the pictures look bad. The Panasonic GF2 is also bad, but not as bad as the Olympus.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The original version of the iBook (a white iBook with the green "g" logo) and the newer (with a "Novell" logo on the cover) were both released in late 2003 and had the same issues. The original edition of the first version of iBook had a backlight that was very dim and caused the entire back cover to glaze over.  This was especially noticeable on the right side of the book.  I had to buy a new one that year.  A new copy came out in December of 2004 with a "new" backlight, and the same problems persisted.   Finally, iBook 2 (blue and black) was released in early 2005 and has a much better backlight and the covers are less glossy.  It also came with an updated version of iTunes that allowed it to play.mov and other video files.  In 2009, Apple released a third iBook model that has the same features and has much better specs. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit arrived very quickly. The sound quality is good. The volume setting doesn't work correctly. The speakers are too close together. It sounds like someone is whispering in the ear of an amp that doesn't have enough power for the audio system to produce sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My iPod/iPhone 5s just died. It came with a 2 year warranty and the original manufacturer's serial number was on the back.  However, the back cover is made of cheap plastic. The back is so fragile that it breaks easily.  The battery has been dead for 2 months.  If you are using this with your computer or smartphone, you should get a new battery. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I purchased this adapter I thought it was just a standard micro usb to usb converter but after a few weeks I noticed a problem:  The adapter does not support the latest version of windows when plugged in. I use an apple bluetooth keyboard to type the majority of my software and the adapter does NOT work with that keyboard.  It will either work with older versions of windows or fail to connect.  I am having a hard time getting my computer to boot from the adapter 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this as an experiment for a new job. I was happy to find a program that had the files from an old computer on the new one. It would work flawlessly for that purpose. But once I got it up and running, I discovered that the sound quality was so poor that it was almost unbearable. After spending several hours trying to make it work properly, I decided to throw it away and start again.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this for my Raspberry Pi.  It worked well in the beginning, but as it got more and more use, the buttons would stop working completely.   The only way to get it to work is to replace all the components with new ones, or to hack the software.  I don't know why this is a $15 piece of junk, but if you don't have a Pi at home, this is the device for you.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price is right, but not the performance. The first time I used this unit, I recorded a cassette with two songs on it in 5 minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to do my iPod, but it doesn't work at all.   It just stays at about 3.5/5, and it's impossible to get the volume to turn up and down because it won't work.  When it works, it's a pain in the ass to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to upgrade my iPod. It came in less than a week and it's working great so far.  The one negative is that it won't let me download music from my iPod to my computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first thing to go wrong was with my HDMI cable, it was so cheap that they cut a piece out of the end.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received my R-8 from Amazon and have been quite disappointed with it.   It has a bad tendency to get out of sync and be out of position, which I assume is due to the use of a cheap plastic enclosure for the microphone.  There is a very good reason for this:  The microphone is mounted on a solid board, which is not made from a cheap material.  My other microphone is also made from something like this, but is much heavier and much better constructed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this card reader, I expected it to perform perfectly. I was extremely happy when it didn't.    The card reader card came damaged, the drive had a short read, and it was very difficult to remove the card and get it into the reader.  The internal speaker is very weak, so you can only make out small words and can't really hear the other card reader working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this for a few months to stream music from my iPod to my HDTV.

Now I am considering buying another one and dropping my current one because of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really like the idea of an analog soundcard. I wanted to use a DAC, but I was skeptical. I thought that if there's a CD, you can't possibly get better sound. Well, I've been wrong about that. The sound quality of this device is superb. I've tried other soundcards and found that they have the same problem with analog. You hear a lot of static and other things that get in the way of sound quality. The HD800 is much better. The problem is that it costs $300. It's a good soundcard, but it costs more than other decent ones that are cheaper. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this device for my new iMac, but unfortunately, it doesn't work. The screen is dead every time I turn it on.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have purchased and returned a number of Sony digital camera's in the past.

After returning the unit, Sony replaced it with another, much more expensive unit, but not before shipping me an even more defective unit.  I finally gave up on Sony's digital cameras and decided to go back to my old Nikon digital cameras.  This one seems to work fine, although I haven't tested it for much longer.

The next day,  the  S3  was   working just as well   as the  iPhone 4.  When  I went back to get the iPhone 4 and  put it back in the S3, it didn't work.  So, I ended up buying a new   phone  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is not what I was expecting.  When I opened my package and looked at the computer I was disappointed in two ways.  First, it looked as though the disk drive had been wiped.  Secondly, it didn't work.  It took a few tries to get it to boot, but after that it was just too slow.  I have two other computers that I bought from them that work perfectly.   I am not going to be buying another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the HP EliteBook 840 G4 because I liked the design. I've had it for a couple of months and it's a pretty great computer. However, the fan that keeps it cool on a hot day is quite noisy. When it gets very hot, it is extremely loud. It is also very smelly when it gets hot. I also bought the same model of notebook from Dell about two years ago and it was quite a bit quieter and I really like it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After using this thing for 2 years, I still find it to be unreliable and unreliable.   I purchased it to replace an old iPod and it turns out that my iPod is now out of production.  The CD player would randomly fail and I'd have to reset it, but not the iPod, which failed just as often.  I've since found a cheaper option for the iPod (and, if you're a Windows user, a decent one), but that's still not an upgrade to me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been a loyal Apple customer for over 20 years. However, after buying the iPhone 6, I am now thinking of replacing it with the iPhone SE because the iPhone is so difficult to use.  I was very pleased with the performance of my previous iPhone, but I would have to admit I am having a bit of trouble with the new iPhone.   After getting into the new features of the iPhone, I realized the screen is tiny and small, and that the fingerprint scanner is really not very accurate.  This iPhone also is very difficult to remove from my clothing when I am using it.  Other than these two problems, I would rate this an excellent purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't have a lot of time to spend on a device but the last one i bought for my laptop had a terrible problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After reading about the other issues I had, I decided to buy the first iteration of this device.  It took almost 6 months and multiple rewires to get it working properly.  I was able to connect a USB keyboard and mouse, but it was almost impossible to get the device to recognize them.  The "smart" card reader is also unreliable, and the SD card reader failed as well.  Also, since this device can be used to run other programs, I found that it could also be used as a file server to copy the files I wanted to the computer.  Unfortunately, the "smart card" card just didn't work properly, and I couldn't copy the whole thing onto the card.  Finally, the SD adapter was almost useless, since it always failed to read and write to the SD slot.   I had to buy a new one, since the previous one simply wouldn't work.  All of these issues are easily fixed by a simple firmware update.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is that this is not a good quality device at all. It's quite thin, but not very strong. You can bend it pretty easily and it won't stay bent. It also has no built-in microphone, so you have to either plug in your phone or use a Bluetooth headset to take voice calls. It doesn't even come with a cable. That's annoying because I use my computer a lot and I'm a big fan of the audio quality when using headphones.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After years of owning iPods, iPhones, and other MP3 players, I had always been looking for an MP3 player that could play music on my computer without spending a lot of money.  So I decided to buy this one.  After reading some reviews about the sound quality (poor bass, poor soundstage, etc) I decided it wasn't worth the money. I got rid of it after a month of playing music on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen is very good, but if you take photos with it you can't make out faces or even other people's faces well. The pictures are blurry. It's fine if you don't want to take pictures but the quality of the pictures is poor.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my Sony player as a backup hard drive for recording.  It works well, but it doesn't fit well in my player. It's very inconvenient to place it in a tray so that it can be easily accessed when the player is unplugged. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First time using an electronic device with a battery that can't hold a charge:  I've been using a digital camera and other electronic gadgets, and this   seems to be the only   one that  doesn't work as advertised.  The  device itself is in working order  but the battery   isn't.  I have two  digital cameras   and can easily make backup copies.  It's been more than two  days and   nothing   has changed.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only problem I had with the P.E. was that the usb port is very small for the type of device it is. I plugged it in twice and the second time I had to use a smaller adapter and it worked fine.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was going through my music and realized my Walkman had stopped working. Took it to Best Buy and got a new one that day for $15.  The battery lasted all day.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is by far the worst electronic device I have ever owned. I bought it because the other one is not working, and the price is right.   It works perfectly.  The screen is nice and big.  There is also a microSD card slot.  However, the SD card is always filled with garbage.  You can erase files and re-create them, but it takes forever.  Even if you make the mistake of writing to the wrong SD card, you can always re-write it.  It's like a new computer! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After I purchased this, I was impressed. I had been in a lot of battles where my wireless headphones were not up to par, and this set did not disappoint. They had great sound.  I had to buy 2 sets as they were so great. But after about a month, I noticed a major problem. The volume controls stopped working. I called the company and they agreed that there was something wrong with them. They replaced them and I haven't had any issues with them since. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item just works ok.  The problem is it won't stop sending the signal.  Even if you put it into sleep mode it will still send the signal and keep getting it's attention.  There are only two options: 1.  You buy a different remote that will stop the signal 2.  Buy a good electronic device that can stop it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My phone is a Sony Xperia S (I have the new 4.1.2 update). I use it all the time to get all the phone calls I missed while the cable gets plugged in. On the first night the cable was plugged in, I had a loud beep that kept coming, and it kept repeating. After a few minutes, it became quiet. I finally plugged it in and had no issues until the first beep came up. This is a very common issue with the cable. It could be an issue with my phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a crappy digital camera that takes lousy pictures.  I've had it for 3 months now and still have not been able to get good photos.  If I had known this from the beginning I would have invested in a better camera.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this unit to replace a broken iPod classic, but the unit wouldn't play music from my old device.  It only played music from the iPod that came with my iPhone 4.  I have a few songs that I do like, but not enough to justify the cost of buying another iPod classic.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the K-01 to replace my old Sony CCD camera.  The K-1 does not support X-Trans.  It takes a special card reader (that doesn't work with standard SD cards) and the interface is so slow that I have to back up every shot.  I would love to use the camera with the Card-Readers that come with digital camera kits, but they are too expensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is so bad it's pathetic.  It doesn't even have the features to function as advertised.  There is no way you can transfer a song from a portable player to your PC or computer.  I was using it as a media player.  This isn't.  You can't even play MP3s.  And when you try to transfer a music file, it just creates a bunch of files instead of just one file.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Purchased my 3rd 3D printer, and this one is the worst.  It took the whole 3 months I waited to buy it to realize how poor the prints are.  The quality is horrible, and I've seen the print quality in other 3D printers.  I'm disappointed I wasted $300 on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my new  Sony A6000 camera. I didn't really like the way the SD card would randomly fail when it was trying to copy files to it. So I just had the camera transfer the files to my external hard drive in real time. The Sony also has a built-in camera card slot. However, the card I use for this camera and my iPod Mini can't be used at the same time. I tried to use the SD slot on my external drive to copy the files but the card won't fit. So now I have to use a card with a smaller capacity. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this as a replacement for my broken iPod and the problem is, I just don't like it.   It doesn't play my CDs (and the quality of these CDs is terrible) or my movies (the sound is very grainy and the pictures are grainy too).  The interface is awkward as well, and the only way to switch it to use the USB input is to take the case off and put it on a USB drive.  Not a good design.  I would be very happy if someone made a good, cheap replacement for the iPod 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is a complete rip off.   I went to a major electronics store to get a new computer (I got a brand new Dell computer, they didn't have one that was even close in price)   When I went back to the store the manager there said he'd never heard of this thing.  I told him about it, he said,   No, you need to look up the company.  If you get a good one,  it's not a rip off,  but it's just a cheap, poorly made product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the G6+ and the G5+ because they were the only models I wanted.   However, I am very disappointed in the product as I found out after several days of using it.  For starters, the G4+ is only a few hundred dollars more than the G3+   For the same price as the G2+ it would have been nice to have more memory.  There's no way the G1 is going to have 1.7 GB.  The G4 is only 2 GB   When you put the G9 memory card in it won't fit in the slots.  Also, I bought a micro SD card for the G8+, which I am using, but the card won't work in the G11+ 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I use this headphone for the first time. It was a great purchase. Unfortunately, the first thing it told me was that it was not capable of playing my iPod. The headphones are okay and I like them, but the audio is awful. It sounds like the speakers are not powered.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product is just great for what I need it for.  I use it to listen to music, my TV doesn't have an HDMI jack anymore, so I've been looking for a way to connect my iPod and connect a TV to it.  After reading about the HDMI-CEC function, I realized I could do that with my TV and now have two HDMI outputs.  The only downside is that you can't do anything with it while it's connected to your TV, but if you leave it connected to the computer while it charges, you can make it switch audio to the TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this adapter in order to use my Sony mp3 player. However, the adapter only works with a Sony mp player with the adapter.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a joke.  I've been buying cheap digital cameras for years, but this   device   makes it   nearly impossible   to get good pictures.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device for my camera and it turns out that it's useless for any purpose other than photos.   It doesn't record video, it doesn't capture audio either.  It's a huge waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The camera is too bad. It's so low quality that it's unusable for anything except making video of my camera at high speed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a USB 3.0 card reader for my Mac from a local computer store in my area and used it to store my music for my iPod, and I was very pleased with it.   Unfortunately, after about three months, the card reader stopped working and the computer decided to erase all of the content stored on it.  I tried using a replacement card, and the machine wouldn't recognize it.   It wouldn't even acknowledge it existed.  It was a total waste of money.  I would've had to get a new Mac and purchase a new card reader, but it's so inconvenient. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the Magic Trackpad 2 to use with my HP EliteBook 11e. However, the trackpad only supports 3-finger scrolling, not the 4-finger scroll that I use on my other laptops. The touchpad, on the other hand, is too sensitive for any other reason. When I use the keyboard, the touchpad jumps around and gets in the way. The keyboard trackpad can also be very finicky when I use my mouse, because the track pad is too big.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product is OK.   There is a slight buzz on the speaker as soon as I press the power button.  The speaker is good and loud.  However, there are several problems with the remote.  It has an unruly cord that makes it difficult to adjust the volume.  Another issue is that it's difficult to remove the remote when the device is not in use.  If you need to replace the remote, you can't simply pop it out.  Also, the remote has a single button that is easy to push.  Unfortunately, that button is located on the front of the remote so you have to hold it in order to move it.  I've replaced my remote several times and have always had trouble with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod Nano is an iPod that cannot be used as an MP3 player.   No way around it.  The plastic casing is too thick, and the back is too flimsy for it to support the weight of the media.  Also, the software is completely out of date.  All you can do is transfer music to/from the internal storage.  I'm a musician and can't use the Nano's built-in DAC without my own hardware DAC or a USB-to-MIDI adapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The ROKU has great specifications, but if it doesn't work you can't be mad because you bought a better one.  The device works fine and the price is right, but you have to take care of it, so it should last a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my broken USB 2.0 drive.  I had my Toshiba HD on the way, so I picked this up to use on my USB 2 drive. After installing the drive, I tried using the drive in a different computer, and the drive failed completely.  So, I went online and looked at other reviews to see if this was an issue with the drive itself, or something with the device.  It turned out that many people were having the same problems.  Then I found this site, and tried to post a positive review.   But the site's formatting screwed up my writing.  Luckily, I was able to edit it after posting.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really liked this headphone when it came out.   It has a very high quality DAC (compared to what's on the market) and an equalizer (compare to some other inexpensive headphone amps).  Unfortunately, these days most DACs and equalizers are so terrible, I can't stand them, and I'm not interested in using them as a music source any more.  It would be a nice thing if these days we could use them for video games, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this for a new MacBook that I intend to use primarily as a music and video player.

The player is very bulky and clumsy and has no buttons or controls. It also costs more than the old player, so it seems like a bad deal for my needs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had my new HDTV and I used to watch all my movies and television shows on it on a daily basis.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As I have been using an   iPad  for about a year now,  I thought  I would try this instead.  The  screen is large and easy to read  I also like the fact that there is an  SD card slot and  that you can use it as a  media player.  However, when  I started using it, I found that the  volume controls on the  side did not work  so well.  There was  a problem with the software  which caused the volume to start  dropping when I got to the middle of  a song.  In addition,  when  playing the game Guitar Hero, the volume control would not seem to function  and would not lower the volume of the guitar.  I have no idea if this is a software or hardware problem but   I am very disappointed

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought two of these to use with my Sonos system. They worked for about a week. They were extremely accurate, and could even pinpoint a specific volume at which the music was playing. However, they got a bit noisy and the volume control had to be adjusted several times a day.   This is a great system, but if they don't work as advertised, I can't recommend them to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the XBMC on December 3, 2011 for my Sony PSP. I used it for a few weeks and couldn't get it to stream any videos to my Vita, so I bought my own. I'm not sure whether the XMBC was included with my PSP because it was a little more expensive, or because the XBox Live player came with my system and was less expensive. Regardless, the XBMC has been an unmitigated disaster. The player doesn't even work with the PSP or my XBox. It simply freezes every time. I've tried every video format it supports--including WMA, MP4, and MOV--and every time it crashes. I can't get the player to load or start playing videos, either. It seems to think it's using VLC, but it can't load. It's like the software has never been installed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have an older version of the BCD10 but I have had my issues with it. I purchased the unit a few months ago. My only issue is that the volume button is very sensitive and it makes it nearly impossible to turn the unit off or adjust the volume while driving. The BCD has a button on it which is much more resistant to it. It is very annoying to be forced to stop driving to turn off the unit while still listening to the music. I also find that the unit is very noisy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a terrible product.   It worked perfectly fine for a year until I tried to copy a DVD on to a CD.  My old computer refused to play the DVD (as it had never played one before), but this one did.  The disc player would not read the disc and said that it had failed.  I thought it was my faulty machine, so I contacted Toshiba's customer service (which was very helpful).  They offered to send me a new one (I said no thanks), but it had been 3 years since I'd bought my last one.  A week later, my computer was still refusing to play my DVD (I had purchased it used), so I called Toshiba.  They insisted that they had sent me the new DVD, but my old one was not faulty.  When I asked why, they said that the DVD read the wrong format.  Then they told me that if I didn't pay the replacement fee they would call me up and tell me to buy another one. I had just spent $300 on a DVD player, so that was a little scary.  Toshiba is also known for their poor customer service.  Now, I don't know if they really have defective products, but that seems like a major problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The micro SD card slots are pretty poorly designed. If you pull them out the top half is made of plastic and you have to use your fingernail to insert it, and it won't come out with any ease. It's a bit hard to put back in, so you have two choices: Use a tiny piece of scrap plastic to insert the card, then bend the card backwards and put it back in. OR, use a screwdriver or something to pop the card out. That last option is not as easy.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very excited when my RCA cable arrived the day I ordered.  The cable itself is beautiful and the box is very nice.  However, the sound quality is terrible.  I use an iPad and it works great.  This thing just sounds like it's coming from another room. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The original Sony HX-100 digital camera had a few minor problems that made it unacceptable for my work.  The first was that it made an annoying clicking noise every time I tried to take a picture.  If you're not careful, you can even hear the clicking, if you're lucky.  Next was a terrible battery life, which meant that if I took a picture of something when the batteries weren't fully charged, the picture would be ruined.  (I'd already shot the same thing and had to reshot it, so it wasn't worth worrying about.)  Then there was the annoying "chirp" noise that appeared when the camera was recording.  I was able to get around this by setting the HX camera to record continuously rather than turn off and on.   After a few months of having this happen on every shot, I gave up on the Hx.  Finally, after a year, the camera stopped working completely and I got a Sony A900.  It had a lot of the same faults as the H: poor battery life and a chirp when it got too hot to hold.  But it's a tiny camera and its design was good, and I don't use it often. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the wireless iPod adapter for my Samsung   This product works very well, but there is one very serious flaw:  It only works with the   iPods in the iPod nano/mini and   iPod shuffle   However, there are no similar compatible products available for   Apple   In any case, I will replace the adapter 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very excited about purchasing the Nook Simple Touch, because it was so new and it was supposed to be very good. I bought it a week ago and have been disappointed as usual. The Nook is very heavy, and it's not very durable. The screen falls out frequently, and I've had it fall out of my pocket several times. I've lost several books due to this. The audio/video player is bad, as well. When it's working, it works fine, but when I turn it off, the device stops working for about 5 minutes. It's annoying, and the NOOK will eventually be dead if it keeps this up for much longer.

Then he went on about how good CD's are

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned three iPods, two of them are really good, and one is okay.   It's so much easier to plug in with the included AC adapter than my old iPod.  The buttons feel a little cheap though.  They're not mushy like my old ones and there's something "spidery" about them.  I have a bad habit of putting my fingers in the button holes when I first install it and "throwing" them off the edge of the device.  But other than that, it's great!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am an audiophile and have owned a lot of different speakers and I really wanted the Sennheiser HD280. Well I was very disappointed in my first listen of the S5. It didn't sound nearly as good as I expected. I bought it mainly because it was cheap, but I guess that it was not what I was hoping for.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was really looking forward to the mP3 in general but when i tried the mPlayer for the first time (after some research) i thought that it was the worst player i'd ever tried (too much latency, bad digital audio, etc.).  I'm so glad i switched to mP4, but it's still a good device and can do most of what a player with similar quality does (except it's not as loud).

The Epson software that came with the M-DAS doesn't work very well either.  It gives an error message whenever I try to print a photo or use it as an electronic device.  I don't know why, but the M+PAD has a really hard time copying photos to and from the memory card.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a bad idea to go with this cheap plastic-like case for your phone when you need a real phone case.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have an old IBM XT mainframe computer which I bought in 1973. I ran several programs on it, including a very old DOS program called DataEdit, which was a sort of database for the XT.  After a few years, I decided I needed to upgrade to a modern machine, but I was afraid that the disk drive might become corrupt and I wouldn't be able to find the program on a floppy disk. I searched the internet and found that a new IBM computer would work just as well. However, the disk on the new computer would not be formatted to work with the old one.  I ended up buying a hard disk controller card and had it installed in my new computer.  The software on the card is a copy of DataEdit that I can run in the old machine.  My other programs work perfectly in both machines, and the controller card does everything I need it to do.  If you don't need a modern computer, then a standard hard disk drive is fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So, my iPhone 5 has a terrible flaw; the headphone jack breaks all the time.   In the past, I've had some pretty expensive headphones that worked perfectly.  It's almost like they were designed for this purpose.  When the phone breaks, I have to get an adapter for the old earphone.  The adapter makes it difficult to keep my old phone connected to my new one.  I'm pretty disappointed in my current phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've used three different iPhones over the past several years and each one has been a disappointment.  The first one, the one that came with my G1, was so bad that I gave it away in a fit of frustration.   The second one, which I have since exchanged for an  iPhone 3G   is now the most reliable I've ever had   Even when it took a hard spill and my SIM card got splashed across my desktop, the iPhone returned to life  The last one I bought, a Samsung SIII   was so broken that I couldn't even connect it to my computer   It wasn't until I tried to boot up the  SIII that I realized it was a dead end.  It was only after I turned it off that I noticed my  S III had been erased.  I was very surprised

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This phone doesn't work well with any cell carrier at all.  It works fine on AT&T and T-Mobile, but it has problems on Verizon, Sprint, and all three US wireless providers.   The camera is very poor (the images from the camera are horrible), the GPS is very spotty, the Wi-Fi is terrible, and the speaker is very bad.  Even when I've paid for the service, I've been unable to get a decent wireless connection.  All I get from these providers is poor signal, slow upload speeds, and poor service.  I've gotten through the year with the phone, but I think I'm going to get rid of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This card reader is awful.  It's too flimsy, too slow and too unreliable to make it a viable alternative to a flash card reader.  If you have to use an iPad at the computer you probably don't want to spend $40 on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There's been some issues with the sound quality of the V2. It's very tinny, like the quality of a cassette tape.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't see how this device could work for audio recording unless the headphone jack were to be used for microphone.   The headphone jack is so far out of the way that it's almost as if they're doing the audio recording on the phone and not the other way around.  It's like they can't figure out that the headphone plug is for headphones, not audio capture. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After years of owning Apple products, I was excited to upgrade to the iPhone 5s. Unfortunately, the device is the worst   It does not support 3G/4G data connections.  There is a 3.5mm jack on the side, but it does not have a 3G or 4G connection.  My 3G connection is with an iPhone 4, so I could have used it to send text messages, take photos, and do other things.  It doesn't support 3.7Mbps.  Even worse, my iPhone's camera takes horrible photos  I can take better photos on my iPhone 4s.  I use the iPod dock as my other camera  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the most useless piece of crap I own.   It was advertised as a "microSD" card reader, which it is not.  It only works as an SD card reader.  The USB connector that comes with it is also useless.  To use it, you need to use a cable that doesn't come with it.  If you're planning to use it as an external drive, it's going to be expensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After using the SDR-Nexus for a few days, I noticed a disturbing problem: the volume control seems to ignore the audio signals I'm hearing when I try to change the volume level. It seems that the device is only using the audio that's being generated by the TV or CD player. This isn't too much of a problem, because I'm always on the go and often don't have a ton of time to wait for my music to finish playing, but when I'm listening to music that I'm not likely to want to have on for the next 30 or so minutes, this seems like a pretty big omission.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a bad experience with my N7.  I'm still waiting for a replacement, which is supposed to be here tomorrow (or sooner).  I have no problems with the N7, as I've had mine for nearly a year.   But this replacement has been very expensive.  The N7 comes with a 32-bit ARM processor.  My N7 came with a Motorola 68HC02 processor (it's called the T800), which works fine with my Windows PC, but not with Linux.  So I paid $180 (or more, depending on what version of Linux you have) just to upgrade to a 64-bit T800.  That's a huge rip-off.  It's a pity I can't just get an open source ARM Linux card, because that might have saved me a lot of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my first Apple device, and I've been very happy with my purchase. However, I wish that there was more space on the top of the device for a second USB cable so that I could use it to charge my  iPhone. I can't imagine how painful it would be to have to use the dock for charging instead of using your phone, as I'd be in constant need of a power source. The iPad Mini is much better for charging than the iPhone, and it's only a tenth the size. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When it arrived I set it up, and it worked for the first few days.

After a week or so, it would randomly switch back to mono.  At first, I thought maybe the CD player was defective, but now it seems that it is somehow related to the MP3 player.

However, now it is broken and I will not be using Touch ID ever again.  It seems that Apple and the FBI are working together to create and sell a fake phone to fool us into paying for a fake iPhone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I was a die hard PS1 gamer when I was younger.  It was not as powerful as I was expecting and was much more of a challenge to set up than I expected.  In fact it would sometimes get stuck at boot time and then I had to reset the system.  That bothered me a lot and I just gave up on buying it.  The controller itself is nice and responsive.  But it is soooooo much easier to use a PS2 controller.  I love the fact that I can put this in my PS3 and not have to keep plugging in the cable.

I had this problem when I bought my digital camera.   My laptop had only USB 2.0 ports, so it could only connect to one camera at a time.  My camera, however, had USB 3.0.  So, I had to buy a USB 3 camera adapter.  When I got this adapter, it looked like a cheap plastic sleeve on a CD, and it didn't fit the camera at all.  The only reason I bought it was because I needed the adapter for another camera.   It didn't work for my camera at least 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery is way too small to work well with my laptop, especially since the battery does not actually provide power for my laptop.  The unit can charge my phone if I'm not at home, but since my phone is powered by a different battery, I can't charge it.   I bought it to use as a "second screen" to my computer, so I can see my email and social networking sites, but I haven't really used that feature since I don't use Facebook or Twitter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My 3rd iPod just broke, and I don't want to be paying $500. I got this because I have been searching for a good portable mp3 player with an iPod-like sound quality and reliability.  It has no built-in memory, no CD player, and it uses an old iPod.  The quality of the sound is poor.  I bought an iPod to replace my old, worn-out one.  While my old iPod was good enough, I had no need for another one. This iPod isn't worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought my first CD player, the CD player did not play CDs correctly and was very bad. I tried my best to read the lyrics, but then it would skip all the way through. I returned it and bought a Sony CD player that sounded fine. This Sony CD Player is the worst I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPhone is so terrible, even worse than my   Sony   portable MP3 player.  I can't play MP3s at all and   every photo on   my  iPod is horribly distorted and  noisy.   It took me three   tries to get my iPhone to work, but  now I have   to buy a new   device to use with   iOS. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received my first Sony device.  It came with a dead SD card.  A software update (version 3.10) fixed the problem.  I am happy with my Sony, but this SD card issue bothers me.  If I need to re-download a file or upgrade to a new version of software, I must do it in order to keep my new device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This iPod can't even be used as a digital music player. When you insert the iPod into your USB port and plug it in, there is no signal to the iPod. I have plugged my iPod into my computer to use as a music player before, but no signal. I've purchased other iPods in the past with this problem, but I was never able to get it fixed.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod is absolutely terrible.   This thing is made with such poor quality that there is no way it will last more than a year.  When you use it on your car stereo, it sounds absolutely horrid.  There is no bass or mids.  They used to make a good portable mp3 player for  the iPod that was similar, but I don't think it was any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a digital camera to use on my phone and when I plugged it in, it turned on but would not take photos. It took too much power and would not record in the normal way. So I got a third party camera that had built in SD card.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When the device arrived, it appeared to be of very poor quality. The batteries were in such bad shape that it took several attempts to insert them. The connections were loose and the device would not turn on, even when the batteries were inserted and the power button was pressed. I'm sure that if I paid $99 for this device, I would have received a defective item. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this device for a year and it is useless.  The audio is very low-quality, the battery lasts only one hour, the USB port is very flimsy, and there's no way to charge it.   It just wastes my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod/iPhone combo is useless.  It works great for recording music and the movies I purchase.  The MP3 player works well, but it isn't much better than my previous iPod.   It also doesn't support many of the digital audio formats it claims to.  I don't care about the MP3s any more because they are all cracked.  No wonder iTunes is so slow and expensive 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a Kingston drive about a year ago. It worked perfectly but when I took the drive out of the case it failed. I then tried to buy another drive and the same thing happened. When I went back to Kingston, I finally got the second drive. However, it was the same problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently bought the Magic Keyboard and it was a huge disappointment.  The keys were made of soft plastic, making them too wobbly to use comfortably. The trackpad was a bit small, and the buttons felt too sensitive and mushy.  I'll still keep it, but I don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Purchased this for my Sony Vaio. I thought it would be perfect for holding a USB key or camera. It is too tall and heavy for the Vaio, and the buttons are very hard to use. It's too big to store in the back pocket of a pants pocket. I will stick with my laptop.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The phone has good sound but terrible battery life. I've had it for about two weeks now, and it's been great. It's nice that there's a microSD card slot, but the battery only lasts about an hour of continuous use. Even with that, it gets warm and starts to get hot. When I'm using it, the phone's battery is always drained. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the XBMC Player a few months back. It's just not good at all. It stutters constantly and refuses to play a decent video file, even if I tell it to play it. The included XBMP player is even worse.

However, the battery life sucks and it's really slow, especially during long video sessions.  I'd buy the original S4 if I could 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the Digitech Digi 001 because I wanted a digital soundcard for my computer and I saw that Digi was giving away freebies.   The freebies came in three packages.  The first two, the $50 digital audio interfaces and the $100 digital audio controllers, were worthless.  They are only meant to be used for digital recording.  I guess I was hoping for a nice, full-size digital audio interface.  It's the Digi's sound cards that are junk.  When you connect a sound card to a computer, you have to run two cables to connect the card and the computer.  There's no way I'd be able to do that with these, because they're so big.  This whole situation is a big disappointment

When they broke after a year and a half of  use, I just replaced them with my own  RK-1 jacks.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I use this to make my own "doubled up" cd's. I have a cheap cd player that is so bad it is hard to buy a replacement when the original one dies.  It is also so bad that I don't need to buy new CDs very often.  This player is even worse!  It takes a long time to find the correct CD and it always gives me the same errors.  The player also has problems with different kinds of discs.  I tried using a regular CD player but it wouldn't even play my CD's that came out of my player.  All I get are errors that sound like it was recorded on a cheap CD player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a few of these and they were defective. When I plugged them in, they wouldn't power up, wouldn't make noise, and the contacts all broke off. I was told by my vendor that the company that sold me them had a defect and I should send it back, but then I got a new unit from another vendor. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this unit expecting a good speaker. I was disappointed with the sound quality, however. It seems to be a typical "crappy" speaker. It sounds as if it is poorly designed and poorly made. The "sweet spot" is very far from the edge of the speaker. They seem to be built with the idea that you're going to use the speaker at full volume most of the time and just throw it away when you're done.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to play my stereo system and it turned out to be a terrible mistake. It plays fine for a phone or mp3 player but not my stereo. It has an input but no output. I used the USB ports on my computer and a cheapo stereo cable. I tried to connect it to my stereo and it did not work. After fiddling with it all day I managed to get it to work but only by plugging the headphone output into a different USB port. I could not get the stereo cable to do the same. I had to turn off the computer, disconnect the stereo and power cycle the unit. This is not a good device and it will cost you $35 to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought my Sonos system about a year ago as I needed to have my entertainment center where I'm watching my favorite TV shows and movies without having to carry it around.  It's worked well enough until the past two or three months, when I've started having problems connecting my Sonoma Blu-ray player to the unit.  At first, the Sonos app on the phone was a godsend, but since then the system has stopped working completely and has been giving me an error message.  I'm going to try using the Sonoma player's aux-in feature to get an audio stream, but that's not going to work either.  The fact that Sonos seems to have been so slow to get this fixed is mind-boggling. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First I have purchased this is to use on my laptop to copy music off it.   It works fine for that, but the problem I am having is that it only copies audio (not video).  If I try to copy any video off the card, it just makes a "skiffy" noise.  Is this an issue with this specific card?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product was terrible.  After buying it, I used it for a week and it was like using my smartphone for the first time.   I thought it would be like the iPhone, but the screen is tiny and poorly designed.  I couldn't find any speakers for it, which was annoying.  It only has one connection for the headset, which is the most annoying thing.  Finally, I gave up and bought a real iPod touch or even a cell phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a Sony a6500, along with a couple other Sony cameras, because I was unhappy with my Sony a6000.   The a65xx and a65x are far superior to the a6000 in almost every way.  The quality is good, the image quality is fantastic, and the size is perfect.  When it works, however, I use them in every situation imaginable, and never have to worry about them being damaged by drops or drops of liquid.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device for my Sony Handycam a few years ago because my old video camera didn't work with the hand-held cam's HDMI output. I was really excited about this new product because it had HDMI output, and the built-in mic and headphone were nice bonuses too. The only problem is, the device can't run without the battery, and even then it's not a huge deal because you can keep the unit plugged in on a charging cable or something. The battery lasts a few minutes, but after a while it starts draining like crazy. It's not worth the price for this, especially for a device that's so useless.

The only thing I dislike is the poor design and the fact that it only comes with 4 USB ports. I have to use the Firewire to connect it to my computer. Otherwise, this is a great way to backup music.

Also, the device cannot charge an iPhone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ300 that I love for video but am finding it difficult to get full resolution video from it on an iPhone.  The camera does not record in the video quality that it promises and only records in MP4 format at 640x480 resolution.  Even if you convert it to SD to get the resolution, it is still a big downgrade.  This camera is also very unreliable - if the remote dies it does not come back.

It also has a tiny SD card slot which is fine for music on the go, but for music stored on it, it's not a good idea.

The G6 does a great job with most photo's I have used but I'm just not impressed with the ability to transfer from my DSLR.  I've tried a few software programs to get it to transfer but to no avail.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this ereader on a couple of occasions, but it just isn't very good.

The USB 3.0 ports are backwards compatible, but the card slots and the two slots on the side are not. If you want to connect two SD cards to it, you have to remove it, open it up, and plug the card into the slot on the opposite side. When I insert the SD card into one slot, it's like trying to insert a credit card into an old-style floppy disk. The adapter's slots are also in the wrong orientation. It makes a noise when it recognizes a card but doesn't recognize the card at all after that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am happy to say the Sony TC-D9 comes in at a very reasonable price point: $59.95 is all you pay for the unit, including shipping, and the sound quality is far above what I was expecting at this price point. However, I'm sad to say that the TC-Ds are not durable enough for professional audio work. The bottom-mounted connectors are susceptible to warping and are very easily punctured. And the remote control is prone to short-circuiting: when I first received it, it stopped working altogether. But I managed to fix it with a couple of heatsinks and two different types of batteries. I've heard good things about the RCA adapters, but they aren't available at a good price in the US, and they have limited functionality in stereo applications. The TC-DS are also prone to failure: one unit broke during an audiophile run.

This thing is way too expensive for what I will ever use it for.  The connection is terrible. I have to put two different cables into it to connect to two different speakers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really enjoyed the idea of having an HD video recorder in my pocket, but the actual product failed me as a whole.  I loaded the recording software up and found it crashed right as I was recording.  After waiting a day to hear about the problem, I called and asked about a repair. The technician on the phone suggested I try to use a different piece of electronics (such as a memory card) to record my own video.  Unfortunately, my video software already recorded it in real time.  The repair cost more than the product itself, and I have no plans to purchase another HD recorder anytime soon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had this phone for about a year and now it no longer has any function. It doesn't have any data or contacts, has a crappy battery and is not very durable.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently purchased an SD card reader. When I plugged it in, it read that the drive was full.  It was, but the card was still in the drive.  The adapter would not read the card until I formatted it with an   adapter and a Windows disk copy tool.   This is  absolutely a  bad    item.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just bought this card reader, and to my surprise it does not have any sort of CD or DVD drive. This is a huge disappointment for a device that costs so little.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first time I bought this I was very impressed with the sound quality. After the initial purchase, however, I didn't see much improvement. It doesn't really sound any better, but at least I can get an accurate EQ for my records, instead of relying on the software to automatically adjust the EQ for me. The only thing that really bothers me about the sound is the distortion - the sound from this amp is so awful that I'm not sure I'll ever buy one again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this item, I expected it to be good, but I was disappointed.  The plastic shell of the CD player is a bit too fragile and bends easily in the center.  It also picks up dirt and other particles.  This has been a problem with other cheap CD players I've used.  Also, when I insert and play a CD, the audio gets distorted.  Overall, it's not worth the money, especially considering the poor quality of sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm not a huge fan of using e-cigs as the battery life is always terrible.  I tried the Kangertech ego one  and it sucked.  So I was really excited when I found out about the K2.  The first thing I noticed was that it was way cheaper than the ego   but the taste wasn't nearly as good.  When it does work, the flavor is great, but as of right now,  I can't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the iPod as my main player for my laptop.  I have been very happy with my purchase.  The player works perfectly with my iPod and allows me to listen to music on my airplane or at a hotel while I am on the road.  It is a great value at a great price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only good thing about this is that it's compact. Unfortunately, the software is so clunky that even when using it in portrait mode, the display is always off. It's just so annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I used a CD player, I burned a CD that I could not play. The CD player refused to read it. I tried the CD player again and this time it was fine. When I purchased this CD player as a replacement, I was disappointed. I wanted a CD reader that could play back both CD and MP3 files.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The micro SD card reader would not read my SD card as expected, and even after using a different card I could not get it to work again. I used my Micro SD card to backup the internal memory card in my phone which works perfectly, but was in no way connected to the micro SD port.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The quality of the buttons on the M3 is about the same as a plastic remote control. They have a soft click when you press them and a hard one when you release. It's also difficult to press a button when the unit is plugged into the TV because it tends to jiggle a little when you try to push it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the TACACS-8E USB DAC and was excited to use it. It worked perfectly and was nice to have an external DAC. Unfortunately, the USB connector on the unit is defective and has developed a spring that is easily dislodged. In an attempt to get the connector back into place, I used the included tool and pliers on the connector. It didn't work at all. I returned the unit to the store and they replaced it with a new one.

I was able to easily connect the adapter to my computer via USB, but the connection was unreliable. I would be happy to pay more for a better one, but at this price point it is not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This iPod 2 was not designed to be a music player.  I wanted to use it to back up and copy songs to a CD.  The digital audio and video formats are bad enough.  If this is a "modern" audio player, it is not even capable of backing up music from CD's.  It's a digital media player. It was poorly designed and poorly priced. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing works so well I bought it as a back-up device for my laptop, but I was always disappointed when the batteries died, or the external battery pack wouldn't hold a charge.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit works perfectly, except that there is only one USB cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the D-Link adapter for a Nexus 4. After downloading and installing the drivers, it worked as advertised, but the DLink DMM never recognized my phone and made no attempts to set it up. I could get it to connect to my phone's built-in modem, but it wouldn't be recognized as a cable modem (which is what I want, so I didn't bother to use the DMM). I had to manually connect to the modem and use it to establish a connection. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you're going to buy this product, make sure you buy the 2GB version, as that's the only way to make full use of it, and the 128GB version can't handle all of my music.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It has a long-term limited warranty, but I recently broke it and the repair cost (shipping and handling) far exceeded the cost of the product.  After that, it won't work.  It takes 2+ minutes to turn it on.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the second time that I've had to replace my iPod, and I've been through two versions of this. The first time, I had a faulty (non-removable) flash drive which would eventually get corrupted. I replaced it with an SD card, but that didn't help. I bought this version, thinking that it would be more reliable, and it's not. If you don't want your iPod to be constantly backed up and sync, this is not the product for you.

I'm hoping they're just a bad batch, but these cost way too much.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this with high hopes. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the sound quality and its overall functionality.  First, the microphone is not very sensitive. It's difficult to use for voice communications and it's much louder than needed for making phone calls.  It does work for making video calls though.  The software also requires that a lot of hard disk space be reserved. This software is extremely expensive and I'd much rather spend a few dollars on a real device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use my wireless card to make wireless connections to my computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had my SPCR-500, SPCS, and SPC-600 for a little while but found them to be defective. The only reason I still have them is because I don't use my Mac very much.  So I decided to try the HP HD-DVD writer.  The first time I burned a DVD, the disc ripped very badly.  I returned it and got a new one.  It ripped fine after that.  Then I tried a DVD and it came up with some garbage, so I tried that one and it worked fine.  The third time I tried, however, it couldn't read anything. I returned that one too, too. I'm so used to the CD-ROMs from Sony and the PC-ROM from Commodore that I never expected to encounter a DVD player that couldn't handle them.  But this was a surprise. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was hoping that this monitor would prove to be an excellent replacement for my computer monitor. It is so small that it is easy to just place in the corner of my desk, and then I can just plug it into my TV. The resolution is nice (1080p), but the color is awful. There is very little contrast between the backlight and the screen. I tried calibrating, but it doesn't do anything. I also tried using the picture adjustment feature, but that only worked if I use a different monitor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item is crap   I bought this to use to connect a wireless keyboard and mouse and it is just awful.  The cable it comes with is very short.  It has to be extra long because it doesn't fit between the wireless keyboard dock and the PC.  There is a whole mess of other crap that you get with the box too.   The battery life is horrible.  I get only 3-4 hours with the adapter.  When I charge it, the battery will stay at 2.5-3 hours   And I only get 4 hours of screen on time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used to use an old Apple computer, but I decided to try the new ones. Well, it seems that this one can be hacked as well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this, I was a bit skeptical. After all, this is a $199 device that is supposed to replace your PC. But I was surprised at how well it works.  It's fast, works flawlessly, and has more features than I expected.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really liked this USB sound card. The problem is that it uses a "full" audio output, and therefore the audio from my music player gets compressed to nothing. So if I plug my player into the USB port, I get no sound. Also, the audio output is only stereo, so it won't work with my stereo system (because I need stereo sound).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After purchasing this product I immediately used it. The first time I used it I was very excited. I was running out of battery power on my old computer, so I had to run out and buy a new one.   The first thing that occurred to me was that I was too tight on the thumb rest - I was able to insert my thumb a little more than I was used to, but this was not enough.  This was especially noticeable when trying to open and close the case.  I went back to my last purchase and tried the same thing - the same result.  So, I am very disappointed with this purchase. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing I don't like about the iPotty is that when you try to use it in bed you need to hold it in your hand while it's powered, but then it has to be manually powered, and then there are some small things that are annoying.   I got the wireless one instead, because I'm a bad sleep apnea sufferer, but it still takes too long to get anything done in bed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really wanted a new USB-C device to use with my Samsung S5 (which has a bad SD card slot).  I've tried a couple of other brands including those from Kingston and SanDisk, and I really liked those.  I had been looking for a new SD card reader since my old one stopped working after a year of use.  After reading all the reviews about this reader, I finally got one, but it's just not as good as the others.  The reader isn't too expensive, but the performance is poor compared to the others

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Logitech MX Master as a replacement for a defective one I got a few years back.   The product itself was well designed, but the design (and build quality) of the keyboard was horrible:  The keys didn't feel like they'd been made with the same precision as a real mechanical keyboard.  There were frequent key-clicks that seemed more like the keys were jammed in than something that would have made the keys click properly.  The mouse also felt cheap and flimsy.  I had to buy a $15 replacement 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My old portable digital player from about a year ago was busted when I plugged it in, but the company was able to fix it by taking the headphone cable out and swapping it.

However, after several months I noticed that the image was becoming increasingly fuzzy. Now, if I use it for just a short period of time it seems perfectly fine. But after a couple minutes, my image is still somewhat fuzzy, although the picture looks fine. I'm not sure if this is the display or if I just have bad eyes. I don't think I'll be using the monitor much in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My son was diagnosed with diabetes 4 years ago. He has to take insulin every day. This device is wonderful! When I went to replace his insulin pump he was so happy that he had a new one. However, after about a month, he realized that the buttons and the pump itself were all loose. When he came to me to ask about it, I said, "it's a little loose" and showed him a piece of tape over the button holes. He said, 'Oh, that's just the way it is.'   I then showed him how to tighten it all back up. He was so thankful for that. Now, he can do all the things he used to do, like taking his shot every 3 hours.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First off, I hate the fact that the micro SD card that comes with this card is designed to work only in Windows (as is the case with all Micro SD cards I've used). Even though the micro sd card works fine with my Android phones, the card itself is just not going to hold all that much. I have had 2 separate micro sd cards in my phone. Once I took the SD card out of my phone and put it in my computer, I noticed that the SD Card in my iPhone would not read it. I didn't want to spend money on a new micro sd if it wasn't going to work with my phone either.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, I love the convenience of having my iPhone on me at all times, but the poor quality of the USB-C adapter is absolutely unacceptable.

It's a complete waste of money, and I would not recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After having to replace a number of my devices with the Apple 3G, the   iPhone 4 was the first  I'd felt the need to replace.   The  device  had a terrible interface.  It's very limited functionality  and  I couldn't find it on the App Store.  There was even a thread on the  Apple Support Forums  where people  were asking for help.   Despite that,  I bought it  with the idea that  it would make up for that  deficiency with the  additional features that it contained.  Unfortunately,   the phone had two problems that I could not  avoid.  First, the screen had a tendency to become permanently  unresponsive to the touch.  When  I first got the phone, I tried to take a picture of  the screen with my  camera.  The phone's screen just  would not turn on.  Second,  when I went to change the settings, the only thing that would appear  was the  menu for the flashlight, which was an  option that I had turned off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the iPod Touch for my 8th grade daughter to use with her music software. She has a big iPod and no way to connect it to the school network. We needed a portable device to do our homework with. I got the iPod for Christmas, and it was fine until she was in 7th grade. After a few weeks, she stopped using it. The iPod had to be plugged into a charger at school.  She didn't even know she had to charge it. It was time to throw it away.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's really annoying when you want to use a remote but get no response to your actions because it's not connected.  If I wanted to change my TV, I have the remote but it's never connected to my TV.  It has to be connected to the receiver.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed with my new i-pad.   First of all, the buttons are almost impossible to press.  Second, the screen tends to go black when the power button is pressed.  Third, the battery life is abysmal.  In the end, I had to buy a different brand of    i-pads. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the iPhone 6 Plus and found it to be inferior to my iPhone 5s. I used to have a good old Nokia phone, and I'm happy to say it's still around. The 5s is slow to load apps. It also seems to have less RAM than the 6 Plus. But the battery is still quite good. I use it a lot for my digital camera and MP3 player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had a number of different Bluetooth devices, both for music and for my phone.  This is by far the worst one.  It has no signal when paired to my phone at all, and it doesn't even pair at all.  The other devices have been great, and the battery life seems to last for ages.   This one is a complete joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use it for my iPod but when the battery died, I had to resort to using my external battery.   The built-in battery would only last about a week on my iPod, but this one lasts almost a year. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this for a year and a half, and never got anywhere near the results I was hoping for.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This unit is worthless!  It does not work well and takes up way too much space in my drawer.  It's not that I like the product; I really don't.  I have a couple of cheap, broken iPods and have never been very happy.  The iPod was so fragile it fell off my car a couple times.   It doesn't even come with a USB cable.  If this product was more accurate, it would be very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was a pretty good purchase from the original ebay seller, but I found that it is not as good as advertised.  I bought it thinking it would be an amazing piece of technology that would be of great use.  It was actually pretty bad for its size.  The battery life is not that great, and it has very poor sound quality.  As advertised, it is great for audio and video, but not the best in the class.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My old cell phone died a few years ago. I found the original charging adapter from the original cell phone to be useless. The adapter has a tiny slot for the battery that allows the battery to be inserted into the phone, but the battery never fits, and can't be removed.  I bought the Samsung Galaxy S4 and after replacing all the original parts, I was able to charge it.  A few days later I found that my original battery had become worthless.   I guess the original charger is worthless, too, so I had to go through the trouble of buying an adapter again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem I was having was that my SD card was filling up with useless garbage.  The only solution I found was to use the SD card to store files.  I haven't bothered with the SD adapter on my new laptop.  That was my last card. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was terrible.  The thing that really bothered me was that it wouldn't work with my laptop's built-in wifi, even after I bought a separate USB adapter and a separate dongle.  This is a huge deal when you have your computer and smartphone or tablet connected to a wifi network.  My solution was to buy another dongling and connect my phone to it, which gave me a USB wifi adapter.  I bought the same one that Apple makes and it worked just fine.  That's the only way to go in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The headphone adapter broke about a year and a half ago.  This is the first time it's happened.  It was easy enough to get it to work again with the included headphones.  I ended up buying the USB to 3.5mm adapter, which worked fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a pair of USB to SD/ SDHC cards for my phone a while back. It was a great deal at a great price, but then, about a year after the purchase, my phone went completely borked:  I'm still using the cards, but it took me a good few days to get over the fact that they would no longer work.  They're very thin and hard to fit into my phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was excited to get my Apple Wireless Keyboard when it was released for the iPad. I used my MacBook Pro as my primary computer until I upgraded to a MacBook Air. After I purchased my Air, I was thrilled when I heard that the iPad Air and Apple Keyboard were compatible.   The only problem is that I purchased a keyboard and I can't use it, as the keyboard has a different layout. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these as an inexpensive way to store all my SD cards. Unfortunately, they only work with one type of SD card:  I just bought these and I'm disappointed. The card reader is very bad and often times it will not recognize a card at all, sometimes it will make a weird noise, and the card reader will not be able to read the card. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is horrible.   I bought it to watch a movie over my computer and I'm glad I don't have to.  I downloaded it to my laptop but the picture quality sucks so bad it doesn't even look like the video's going to get to the computer at all.  A black and white TV has a much better quality image than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is a nightmare. Every time I plug it in, I get a bad AC adapter error message, but I can get to the Internet if I wait a second.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, I didn't realize until I bought the unit that it was a 2-button unit and that the two buttons were very close together.  The second thing is the fact that the button that makes the light blink is very poorly positioned.  It's really just next to the power button and it's very difficult to get a good push with this button.  There's also a weird button on the back of the unit, which doesn't fit well either.   The unit also has a lot of problems with the SD card slots.  I'm using it as my primary SD card.  If the SD cards get formatted and changed, they often don't work at all.  Also, the SD slots don't like to be filled all the way full.  In my case, I needed to go to my computer to do something, and I had a file on my card that had to be removed before I could do that.  When I was trying to remove the file, it didn't work.  Finally, I went to the web site and looked up the SD reader, and it said that my card wouldn't be recognized.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Purchased this camera on an impulse to document a recent camping trip. I bought the camera to take photos of my friends on the trip, and not much else. The camera worked great on my first trip (which was my first with a camera) and I kept using it, but it did not record the night sky very well. After a year of using it on trips with my friends (both experienced astrophotographers), I finally gave it away because I didn't think I'd have much use for it. This was about a year ago. I just recently found out that it is no longer available in the store, so I went back to pick it up. It's pretty cheap at retail. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very nice piece of gear. The sound quality is great. However, I have a Sony CD player that I own, and the Sony CD's sound better.  The E-P5 has the same type of high-end sound but is much less portable than the Sony.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The camera quality is very bad. There are many moments when the image is blurry or the video gets choppy, but it's very difficult to discern those in the video.  It has very poor auto focus, so you're left to do a lot of manual focus and then hope the camera will autofocus when you press the shutter button.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a horrible electronic device. The first thing you do is plug it in and it tells you you have a defective USB port, which it does. The second thing you must do is make a note of the serial number of the device and use it to send in a defective unit. It takes months to have your defective unit fixed by Apple and after that, you have to buy a new one. I have been frustrated for years trying to get a faulty iPod to work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I originally bought this I was very impressed. The quality of the sound is far better than a regular mp3 player. Unfortunately, it has a serious flaw, it will permanently brick any player that has a problem with sound quality.   The only problem is that it won't let you use a usb device, so even if you get a spare player it will never be used again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thing to listen to my mp3 files, and it was a huge disappointment.  It sounds like it is running slow, which is never a good thing.  The internal speakers are mediocre.  Also, the remote has a few flaws.  If you use the remote while driving, it can be a little annoying to get in and out of your vehicle. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this as a second external hard drive for a laptop because my external drives were already too slow. I was very happy to find that this external drive actually performs better than my other external drives!  I'm not sure why they call it a "M.2" slot.   This drive only uses M.2 (PCIe 2.0) connectors.  I didn't even think to look up which M.3 (PCie 3.0, which is backwards compatible with M.1/M.0 type connectors) connector they used.  It turns out they only used one M.N.2 connector and didn't bother to convert it to M.5.  This makes a huge difference, especially if you need to transfer data that is stored on a different M.0 drive, or other devices like the M.4 USB stick that comes with my new Lenovo Thinkpad T430.  The speed on this external hard Drive is also very good!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound quality of the Sony BMG player is poor at best. The player is hard to mount, the remote and batteries don't fit in the case and I have a hard time finding the two batteries included.   Sony doesn't even give instructions on how to replace the batteries.  It's the same thing with the remote.  You have to unplug the USB connector to get the remote to work.  Also, there is a serious problem with the player that you can't fix.  As soon as I put the player into my DVD player, the player shut down.  Not sure if that's normal but it's pretty bad.  This really sucks because you don't have to buy a separate player for your DVD player or your MP3 player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When it comes to electronic devices, the old standby is good, and the new, cheap, overpriced alternative is bad.   The Panasonic Toughbook is not good.  In fact, it's horrible.  The first time I opened it, I tore it apart, because it had failed the first two times I tried to use it.  I returned it because I didn't want to waste money on a device that didn't work.  Now I've returned my second one.  This Toughbook has been replaced by a new one from a different manufacturer, but the quality is still very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my older, crappy 3.5mm to RCA audio adapter, which failed at the same time as my iPod, and for just $10 less.  I've never really used an audio adapter with a line out before, so I thought this would work great.  It turns out not so much, and the built-in speakers don't sound very good, even with the volume cranked all the way up.  The built-ins also tend to be pretty weak; when I put in a CD, it cuts out when I start a song, which isn't so bad if I have a good sound system in the car, but when I try to play an MP3 or CD, the quality goes down the tube.  This was probably one of the worst purchases I've made, but I was very happy with it for its price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this USB audio player in April 2012 because I didn't have one of those little, cheap CD players. The price was right and it was the only player on the market with a headphone jack. It works fine, but it only has a single, mono channel output. I don't use that channel much, but I need it for streaming media. If you have a USB device that doesn't have a headphone port, you can't use it for media either.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new Sony Handycam HD for my brother in law who is on his 2nd camera system.  The first camera was great but the Handy cam is just as bad.  My first camera failed within a month of shooting so I figured I could get my money back but I'm just not happy.  I'm not sure what Sony is thinking but making cheap cameras that fail out in the first two months of use just seems like poor business practice.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem:  The iPod nano is so unreliable that I've had to have it replaced twice. First with a new battery, and later with the original.  The first problem involved the battery.  It only took a few months to completely die.  I returned it, and got the iPod nano with a replacement battery.   The second problem involved a faulty connector.  After a couple of uses, the connector started to fail, as did the battery in the device.  Eventually, I had to take the whole thing apart.  This device is junk, in my opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first thing you do when you get it is connect it to your computer.  The connector is pretty flimsy, and I ended up having to do that twice before I got the connection to work.  I also had a similar issue with the iPod Classic (I've also had to do this with a couple of other Apple devices).  The third time I tried connecting it, it didn't work. I'm not sure if it's the same one or if they just changed the connector, but the first time they just gave me an EHX unit instead of a replacement.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had the original Xoom for about two years now, and I have used it very successfully. However, it came with a CD player and no headphone jack, so I always have to replace it. I purchased this version to replace that, and it works fine for most of my needs. I'm not the biggest fan of its screen resolution, but most people won't notice. I don't use my Xoom very often, so there isn't much time to be worrying about its small display. I also like the wireless feature better than the included wired version.

I bought it because I read a lot, but only recently found out that I can't always get my books in at the start of the book.  Well, I'll be damned if I don't use this as an excuse to try and read some non-fiction books. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The Sennheiser HD 4100   is an expensive way to enjoy a decent headphone.  It is a great device to have in your computer or in your ears, but if you want better sound, buy a better set of headphones.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the USB key for my PS3 for Christmas, but I have yet to use it. I tried the key on my PS4 and it's a horrible experience. It's so bad I can't really stand to use my PSVita.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only negative I have about my    Sony Playstation 2   is that the USB plug for the gamepad is very hard to remove. It's almost as if it was glued there. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the Epson 3MP USB 3.0 Camera.  I use it on a Sony camera.   It worked great until my camera decided that it no longer had an Epson adapter.  It will never work with my current camera because the EPTD plug doesn't fit.  For some reason, the Sony and Sony Pro products that I have bought both refuse to work.  Sony doesn't seem to care.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just bought a Sony DSC-RX100 III to use as my home theater system. It's an excellent and very reasonably priced camera, but I just can't get the firmware to recognize any of my inputs. It will try to set the camera up as a monitor and then it tries to output to my TV and it refuses to even try, and it's got an HDMI cable, but it's connected to a computer and not my TV, so it can't even display a picture to my screen. It also can't set the menu as my TV is the source and it can only set it as the monitor. I tried to set up the camera as a source on my PC and connected it via HDMI cable to the TV, but nothing happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am using a Logitech C920 Proteus Spectrum. It works great, but it's a joke in video games. It's the same size as a standard PlayStation controller, and it uses the same standard PS buttons and sticks. It doesn't even have a d-pad. What a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the E-Hooker to use with my laptop, and it worked pretty well until one day the USB port on the laptop died. I got another E-Port, and this time it worked perfectly. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod is the WORST MP3 player ever. I can't believe that it took me this long to try it out. It is just too small and too expensive. I also bought the player and I can tell you that it is just not worth it. It's terrible, too much of the same crap over and over. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been using a new MacBook Pro for more than a year now and the battery is beginning to show its age, especially the lithium polymer batteries (   The battery is so weak I can't charge it without using the AC adapter. This   isn't so much a problem when you use your computer for other purposes (reading, playing music, watching movies), but when   you need to use it for work, you realize you can't. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used the iBasso   with my Sony A65 for a while, but found that the device was too sensitive and sometimes caused audio issues.   The iBasso   is a much better solution. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Purchased this unit a couple of weeks ago. Since then, the USB port on my PC has been freezing up. It seems to happen every day. After a week or so, I contacted Sennheiser and they said there was no problem and that the device itself is good. So now I have to wait 2-3 months before I can get a replacement. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really excited about this USB 3.0 card.  I used to own a Toshiba external drive and had good luck with it.  It works flawlessly with my computer and  I love to have a couple of GB's of space.  But,  the only problem  I've run into  is  The card won't fit into the slot on my card reader 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these things a couple of years ago for use with portable DVD players and audio cassettes.  I use these with my Sony D5100 every night in my car.  They work really well.  It has the added benefit of being wireless, which is great.   Unfortunately, one of them has the small chip that keeps them from working when inserted into a USB port.  Even if I lose the card, I can still access the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these with a specific purpose in mind: They are meant to hold a DSLR, but they don't hold up. This is a major disappointment since these are the very first thing I've ever used that I couldn't even get set up to work properly. I was really looking forward to using them, but I'll likely look at buying something else at some point. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a horrible product.  It doesn't work, it's too expensive, and I can't figure out how to get it to work.  The USB connector broke off my iPod, so I have to buy a new one.  I just can't stand to spend $100 just to have a device that's so easily destroyed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It doesn't work.   I bought this to replace a broken computer mouse.  It worked perfectly for a few days, but after that, it would randomly stop working.  I can't figure out why it doesn't stop working after a week or so.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I purchased this, I was excited because the device did exactly what I needed it to do, but upon using it I soon found the whole thing to be useless because it was soooooo loud and clunky.  The buttons are small and hard to use, and the screen just isn't very good at all.  I'm looking forward to getting a new one in the near future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the first bad device I have ever had.  The first one I got I just couldn't figure out why it was failing.  It turned out to be the power supply.  This one is worse.  There are a lot of problems with it:  1.   It comes with no software or drivers for Windows XP or Windows 7.  No CD-ROM.  Not even the original Windows CD.  2.  They're all over the place.  Here I was going to buy a Samsung Chromebook, and I can't find this.  3.  For $80 it's just so bad.  I can buy a decent laptop from Costco for less.  4.  You can't use it for anything.  Even trying to play my music is a total failure.  5.  In the box is a crappy USB cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When it came I was very skeptical as this is a very expensive product. This thing is supposed to be able to transmit data to your computer from any device within range. It does so very slowly and is very hard to operate, but with a little patience and time, I was able to get the most of it. The problem is that you have to be within 5 feet or so of your router to get it to work. In addition, I have been having issues with the ethernet port. Every time I plug it in, it stops working, but I can't figure out why.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen appears very clear and sharp. However, it is very hard to read the letters on the page due to the display's poor resolution. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my computer to replace the stock hard drive because it is so easy to plug in.  When I tried to plug it in the computer wouldn't recognize it.  I called Apple Support, but they told me I needed to return it to Apple so it could be exchanged with a new one that would work with my computer.  They told me that my computer was incompatible with a "newer" hard drive, even though it worked just fine with the old one.  After a lot of Googling, I found out that the problem is caused by a different kind of drive.  My hard drive has no problems with anything in my computer, but the "new" hard drives from Apple have problems with them.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took two months to receive my new HDP-1.  The device came damaged in the mail,   and it took almost a month to repair it.    While I could not get it to work properly, the audio quality and battery life were much better than expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's terrible.   If you use your phone as a phone, then you will never want to use it as a camera.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing is so slow that it can't even do any of the basic things most tablets and smartphones can do.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had no problems using my new USB device with the Apple TV and iMovie for my iPhone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just purchased the   Sony Ericsson Xperia Z   for my 16 inch MacBook   and I'm very impressed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to use with my old Sony DVD player. The video quality is terrible. I use a DV camera that was built 20 years ago, so the video transfer was bad enough that I had to upgrade my recorder to a better model. The CD player doesn't have the capacity to hold my collection, so I can't play anything. So I had an old player and a brand new CD. I was able to record the CD from the old player, but it's very scratchy, and it's too big to be portable. I can use my old player to play the recorded CD from my new player, so that works, but that doesn't sound good.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this   as a replacement for a failed USB 3.0 flash drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very interested in getting a portable hard disk as I do not have a DVD player to store the pictures and videos I make.  The device that was sent is very much like an old floppy disk that has no built in power source.  I opened it up and the inside seems very flimsy and poorly made.    In addition, the drive has an external power supply that needs to be plugged in to charge it, which makes it not very portable.  In the event that I ever need to move it, I'd need a small powered external power source for the drive, which means I'd have to plug in a USB drive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this for a short time.  It is not fast enough for the number of apps I use, especially after upgrading to iOS 9.  A very simple USB memory card reader.  I bought two because my iPhone 6s does not come with one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently purchased an HD DVD player from Best Buy as part of my "ditch the DVD player and just buy a TV" plan. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by the sound quality.  The player produces a very tinny sound that is not very accurate to what is being played.  It has a similar effect to using a CD player with a bad turntable.  I don't know what the difference is between a bad HD DVD Player and a bad CD player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is so bad! First of all, it doesn't have an SD card slot. You have to buy a dedicated card reader. This is stupid. You also have to connect it to a computer to view or edit files, then connect it back to your TV to run the program. That's so stupid! I'm only going to get it when I need it for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the E-reader as a backup device for my iPad. After using the E for a month and a half I was surprised to find it so weak and flimsy that it wouldn't stay charged all day and my batteries had to be replaced every three weeks. It also didn't last as long as it could be expected to in a high-stress environment like the college library. The new Kindle Touch is so much better, it's ridiculous. I'm not buying the Kindle Touch just to replace the E, but because my E is so old and flakey. I'll be buying the new Kindle when it becomes available.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After 2 weeks of using my new iMac, I got rid of my iPod Touch. Why? Because it's a waste of space, and you're supposed to pay $200 for it. It has the best sound quality, but you're not paying for that. It's the size, price, and design. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the E-Book Reader about 3 months ago and I am glad I did.  It's been amazing for me to get a book that isn't in my electronic devices.  Unfortunately, I am still using my Kindle for reading.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got my new Samsung Galaxy S III a month ago. I've been a fan of the S series for years, but the S III is a big step up in every way. It's fast, has great graphics, and has a larger screen than its predecessors.   The only problem with it is its size - it's very cumbersome to use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my first digital camera, and I'm so disappointed   I can't even start to use it.  I bought the 64gb SD card, and the camera is really only capable of taking RAW images.  When I try to copy a photo from the SD card to the card in the camera, the camera says the card is full  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for a PC that I am building, and I'm not a big fan of the cheap, "one-size-fits-all" adapters. However, when I saw this one, I immediately bought it. Well, as expected, it's not very good. The audio quality is very poor; the sound is muddy, and it is hard to turn the volume up, because it just repeats over and over. I was looking forward to a good DAC that would handle my high-resolution (16/44.1) CDs and MP3s without sounding muddy. I'm glad I didn't buy this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's OK but has a few drawbacks:  1. It takes a lot of time to charge:  After about 3.5 days of heavy use, it took nearly 2 hours to fully charge.   2. The volume buttons are very, very bad:  The volume and play/pause buttons are so-so.  They don't work very well.  When I press them, the "pause" sounds are annoying,  and they're super awkward to use.  3. It's a really, really expensive product  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned a few of these and I've had no luck with them.  One came with a broken memory card, one failed to activate, and both broke after 5 months  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my Sony A65 for the sake of it being small and portable.  I was very pleased with the results for both the camera and the camera/phone combo, but I didn't really understand how useful this would be until I used it as a camera/camera combo to take pictures.  Unfortunately, it's so bad that I won't be buying it or recommending it.  It has been crashing all the time even though it's supposed to be super durable.  The camera and phone both act as a sort of hub to stream the signal to the device via a USB cable.  This means that when I plug a cable into a USB port on my computer and start up the camera, I get the following error message:  "Unable to connect to the camera  Failed to initialize the camera.  Unfortunate.   To solve the issue, you should try connecting to the port with a different USB cable."  If I plug the USB cable in, it works.  If you plug a different cable into the camera at the same time it doesn't work either.  A software update might help if anyone knows what it's about 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The new iPhone 4s   was   so fast and easy to use that  I had to  remove my other   phones just to get the   new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a third generation of these for my Xbox 360, and they work just as well as the original. The only negative I have is that if you drop the controller, it breaks off into 2 pieces. But if you're careful, you can repair it on your own, or buy new ones.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had this watch for a month and I just can't seem to get it to do what I want it to.   First, it won't turn on.  I have no problem getting my old Timex watches to work again, but this thing just won't work.  It's supposed to be able to automatically start and stop whenever you press a button, but it won.  Every time I press that button to turn on my watch, it will go through this process, but then just stop.  If you want the watch to start up when you press the button, you have to use the button on the side.  Even that doesn't work because it doesn't stop.    I tried charging it up, and it still won't start.  This is not a watch that I expect to have trouble with. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This card reader is not very good. I bought one from an electronic device company about 3 years ago that I kept for several years. It worked good but eventually lost its memory cards. The replacement card reader from this company is just as bad.  It doesn't seem to work and it's very easy to destroy the hard drive in the drive bay when it needs replacing 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My device died 2 days after it came in the mail.  It was not even plugged in.   It is defective from the start.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The audio quality is poor on this device. There is no audio output or headphone jack, so the sound quality is almost all "audible" with headphones.  I bought the unit because my last digital audio player was so horrible that I had to replace it.  This unit, with its tiny 1/8" headphone jack and "audiophile quality" DAC is so subpar, I had a hard time recommending it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace my old, broken, crappy computer. It worked so far but I am still waiting for it to do something useful: convert the crappy CD quality audio I use to play music on my computer to the high quality MP3 audio on my iPod. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a cheapie Panasonic DVD player a few years ago for my college-aged son's car stereo. The player is very quiet, and when it's powered on, it doesn't even make a noise as the discs are inserted or extracted.   The only problem with the player is that it only plays video discs.  It can't even read any sort of CD or DVD that's been ripped by a compatible computer.  I purchased a $50 player that was supposed to be able to play audio CDs, but it only played MP3s.  In fact, my son's MP3 player is the only thing that works at all on the car stereo now. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After owning an iPod, the iPod shuffle has never made the cut.  There is no room for the shuffle's headphone jack and no room to plug in external speakers.  I had to buy a USB drive just to use my iPod with my television.  The shuffle has become my daily driver for music. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In retrospect, I'm glad I only ever bought one of these products. It was easy to use and I got great results, but I've been using my other devices forever and they're better. I will probably buy this one again, but probably not until I've saved up more money for a replacement.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought my Sony DSC-RX100 for my first DSLR camera but couldn't get it to work.

After all the troubleshooting, the camera works but, as with my first camera, it only takes "fine" photos. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased my iPad mini 3 about 3 months ago. I'm very happy with it.   The screen has a very nice color, is very bright, is super thin (almost indestructible), and has a good quality speaker.  However, the  connector for the battery is a very poor design.  It's a single point connector that is very difficult to replace.  The connector is a pain to remove when you just want to plug in a new battery.  Also, I have tried many battery connectors and none of them match up.  I haven't noticed any degradation in battery life when I've used them.  There is one exception to this, but it only lasts a week or two of moderate use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just got the iPhone 5, and while I'm generally a huge fan of Apple products (and this is by no means a bad one), I am not yet totally sold on the fingerprint sensor.  My last phone with a fingerprint sensor was the iPhone 4S (2nd generation), and I'm not sure it's worth the extra money.  The iPhone 5 uses the same kind of fingerprint reader (FIDO), but it's slower and has a worse reading quality (I've read some reviews where the fingerprint scanner will sometimes be stuck to the phone).  My other two phones are Samsung (Galaxy S3), and Nokia (Nokia Lumia 900).   So far, I'm giving the iPhone a chance, but I will have to give it a few days to get used to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound quality is so poor, that I can hardly use it. It's so bad that I have to turn it off while using a PC to get the audio in. I have two other cheap USB-cables that sound much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used an Apple keyboard for many years, and the first thing I thought when I saw a Logitech Revue was that they would look like cheap knockoffs.  This one is about as good as I've seen on the market (except that the software on it is horrible).  It's a shame because the Logitech ones are just so much nicer.  It would be even nicer if the keyboard included a backlit keyboard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This card reader is extremely bad! It's very difficult to insert/remove, the contacts are often loose, and the cards just won't stay inserted.  I have three cards left in my wallet and I'm having a hard time replacing them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have to say that my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ has a few shortcomings that are annoying. For starters, when you try to record video on the phone, it doesn't seem to recognize the SD card as having enough space for the video. You have to use a USB drive or external drive to store the video, or just make your phone do it for you. The other thing is that my screen won't turn off while recording video. It's like the screen is constantly on. It makes me feel like I'm recording something in black and white.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This has become my third USB hub.  It's a pain to set up.   It can't transfer video over USB.  The other hubs don't need to be set up at all.  No matter.  This one needs to be fixed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a great idea until the product blew up and the warranty never took effect.  The unit I received last December was defective and would not charge, then it would be defective for 2 months. It would work for the first month or so but then would randomly freeze up for no reason. It was so annoying that I finally got it to work by taking the battery out and replacing the board. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this keyboard for over two years and it finally died.  It was so bad, I even tried replacing the unit and found the battery was completely dead.  The keyboard itself was in poor shape and had lots of dings and scratches.  I thought it was time to get a new one.  But then I realized that I had no way to use the keyboard to type at all.  So I had to go through all the steps of replacing the keyboard and plugging it back in.  After all that trouble, I finally gave up.  And then I found this little dongle.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I bought this device, I was a little bit scared to try it out, because I'm not a huge fan of the iPhone.  However, the iPhone really didn't do anything for me, and I ended up turning off the device and trying out a couple of other devices.  This device is really a great replacement!  It's much easier to use, and the app makes it so much easier than using my phone.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've bought 3 of these so far and they have all had this same problem.  I put them in my pocket and walk to the grocery store in the afternoon, and they start to sound horrible.  They've also started to burn up on me if I keep them on my key chain or in the car.   It's an annoying issue that needs to be fixed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After using my Sony digital camera, I found it too small to fit in my pocket and too heavy to carry with me.   This is a great alternative but it's not small enough to use at home. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The Samsung CD player seems to have a weakness in the analog outputs. As a result, the CD playback is poor. The sound is almost completely digital in quality. It's terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item is great for listening to the radio and the car audio system at the same time. However, after a couple of months of use, the input jack breaks. Not only does the cable get damaged, but I also lose the audio from my car's speakers as well. The audio jack also tends to crack on its own.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the S4 because it's smaller and lighter than my iPhone.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It does not feel any smaller, and in addition to having to lug it around, I have to charge it up at least twice a week.  The screen is still quite usable for video and email, but not for phone calls.  There is no way to use it as a USB keyboard, either, so I'll stick to my iPhone when it's not in use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using a Sony PCM-C100 for over two years.   It has worked fine until the second week of December when I suddenly got a lot of noise in my music: clicking/clicking/clattering noises.  This lasted for about two months and then went away.  I'm not the only person to notice this.  No problems in my other Sony players 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a backup to my backup HD. It worked fine for my 1.5 GB SD card, but when I tried to copy some music to the SD card with a USB drive, it wouldn't work. The drive would not be able to read the file. I tried the USB card with another hard drive, but that did not work either.  I was hoping that it was a hardware problem because my PC is quite old and the SSD has plenty of spare space.  However, I'm still having the same problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The  iPad Mini doesn't have a built in microphone, but does have an SD card slot.   Unfortunately,  it takes up the entire space  of my SD card, making  it unusable in any but the smallest capacities  of SD cards.  The mini also doesn't play well with Bluetooth devices, like the Garmin bluetooth headset, but it  also has a headphone jack  I've connected it to,  and  it still works  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Poor build quality and a cheap micro-usb cable   I have a few of these on hand and they are very nice but these are a complete failure. I ordered them because the price is very good and they have a good reputation  Unfortunately the build quality is poor and the micro-USB cable will only last a few years 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am using this product for the first time and I have only used this for my computer for the past few months.  I have no problems with it, but as you may have heard, it can fail.  This happens to me more often than not.  When the unit is not working, I have to take it to a repair center and have it returned.  It's pretty expensive to buy a new one, but it's a small price to pay to avoid having to wait so long for a new unit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the   Sony D-6 as part of a new   digital camera.  It works perfectly  but  it   suffers from  poor   quality.  I am sorry  Sony  but it is not worth the  price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had the iVTC-S for about a month now.    The unit works well enough, but not so well that I want to keep it.  If I'm on the road, I'll just stick with my iPod. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this card reader a year ago.  I got a bunch of new hard drives, and the old card readers just kept dying.   It would be nice if I could use it with my old hard drives (the ones that don't support ECC).   My only complaint is that the connector to the card reader is a bit difficult to insert. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So many things about this device   I had a broken SD card in my camera for years.   It was a pain in the ass to format.  So when I bought this, I wasn't sure it would work.  The only thing I had trouble with was reading the memory card.  I read a couple of my images and there were a few files missing.  For a while, I thought it was my card.     The card I bought is a little less than half full   But I'm using it all up now 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The  USB cord used to power the    phone is   very   cheap.   Even if I had a very large USB cable I would have used a larger   cable to power it from my   computer.  The unit is  expensive but   the cable is so cheap that  it would be cheaper to buy a cheap   USB   device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had the iPHONE 3G for a few weeks now.  It's a nice gadget.   The sound quality is good.  The screen is sharp.  Battery life is average.  Unfortunately, the phone has been a complete disaster.  I purchased a second iPHONY 3G and used it for a week or so before I decided to replace my third iPod with the 3G.  My third iPod was still working.  And the new third one died just a couple of days after I installed it.  After a week of use, I decided that the 3g was just an iPod and I couldn't live with it.    If you want to buy an iPHONY for use on the go, do it!  But don't expect it to last very long.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got a new  iPod shuffle and was excited to get it, but I didn't notice that my battery was dead by the time I got home.   My  iPod went into a sleep mode without even a warning and I had to unplug it, then re-insert it to get to work.  My new  iPhone  doesn't go into sleep mode when I charge it, so it's useless to me.  The iPod shuffle  I bought  is  more  expensive  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this USB drive to transfer all of my music from my mp3 player to my ipod. I purchased the usb drive but never got it to work. Then, last week, I lost all of the music on my ipad.  After spending more than $100, I figured I would buy a new ipod and get the new mp3 on my other ipad and just transfer the music over. Well, I have not been able to get this to work at all.   It takes so long to copy the music that I can't even listen to it at my house. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I wanted to listen to my mp3 files on my mp2 player on my ipod. It worked great until I plugged it in to my laptop and it failed to work. I don't really care for mp3s but this was worth the $40.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works great until it stops working at exactly 1 minute after I turn it on.  I would buy it again if I had the $50, but I will not buy it because of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got the Sony A7s with my Fuji X-Pro 2   I had really high hopes for the camera.  The A7 is supposed to be the new gold standard of the digital era.  It is, at least for me.  But it didn't take long   for the A7 to start sucking.   It consistently   takes photos that are just not very good.  For instance,   most photos from a good night   are really clear and nice.  Unfortunately, that's not the case   when   there is a lot of lighting in the frame, as is often the case with   events.  That's especially   problematic   because many   digital cameras have   great low light sensitivity.  This camera   doesn't seem to have any   sensitivity, which means   photos from   the same event will have similar   results

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The price is well worth it   This is a bad way to store music:  All the songs I wanted to get are gone   You have to press and hold the power button for 20 seconds   Then you can access and select them   I'm not a big music fan and have an iPod or a cassette player   But I just can't bear to see this 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing that comes to mind when I think of these new wireless earbuds is the awful quality of the last one I bought.  They aren't bad - they just feel cheap.  These new ones are much better - they're more comfortable, easier to insert, and I like that they are rechargeable.  I'm also very pleased that the earbud cord isn't made of the same thin, wimpy plastic that comes with the original Bluetooth models.  It's also easier to take off the earphones when they're full of water (they're meant to be waterproof, right?) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I wanted to keep my laptop in a slim shape so I could keep it at my desk but also make the best use of my 2 SD slots. The card reader does work but it is so finicky that it is almost impossible to install the latest version of the operating system that came with my laptop (Mac OS X 10.5) on my 2nd SD card. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a YubiKey 2.0 for a few days and discovered that it doesn't have the 2.5mm stereo mini jack.  When trying to use a micro USB cable to connect to my computer, the micro USB connector is always broken off the Yubi Key 2.  I could use the 2mm mini jack for audio but not for data!  This was a huge bummer because I have a 2.1 sound system and need all the convenience of a Yubikey.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got this machine it came with a hard drive and card reader that I couldn't use.   The hard drive didn't work with my laptop and I got it replaced at the local computer store.  The card reader couldn't be used at all and I can't recommend that they keep it in stock. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First, the USB connection is not the most reliable.  It has failed several times over the years.  Sometimes I had to put it back into the case, sometimes I didn't.  The other problem is the poor quality of the batteries.   You need to buy more than one pack to get long life out of the unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took me a very long time to realize that the 3.5mm headphone plug is so fragile. It fell off of my iPod every time I put it in my computer bag (a small bag that the iPod fits in perfectly, not that it needs to). 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to do my car audio for my CD player, but it's terrible. I'm not even happy with the car audio. It has no dynamic range, just annoying static. The headphone jacks are terrible too. I can't hear myself talk at all. I'd expect to get better quality from something that costs $50. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have purchased 2 Apple II clones. One has been working very well for about 2 years. The other has always given me the same issues. Every time I get on it, it's like it's trying to run off a power line. I have to turn the power off and then turn it back on, but I know the thing has run out of juice by then.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The original iPod was one of the best portable media players I have ever owned.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very impressed with my first purchase from Nissin. However, the 2nd unit I bought didn't work very well. The remote didn't recognize my remote device. The second unit took forever to connect to the 1st unit. I also found out it wasn't compatible with the first unit, so I returned it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The LCD screen on this DVD player is completely opaque and difficult to see unless it's at least an inch or two from my face. It's really a pain because there's no way to use any of the buttons on the back of the player for anything other than skipping through the movie. Even when I set up the player to skip directly to the end of the film, I can't find it on the player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using the original  Sennheiser MKE2000  to listen to my CD player for a long time. I recently purchased  the new  SONY MX600. Unfortunately,  the  MX6000  doesn't seem to play  well at all.   The sound is very rough, and the volume  is very low.  I also don't like  the fact that it has a remote  control with the volume controls  but not the headphone  controls. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The E-PAD II is the best electronic device I've used in a long time, but the E-Reader isn't very good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the third time I have purchased the EeePC. The first two had been defective. The third has worked fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had the original iPod which I loved and owned for a long time, and this thing is just not up to snuff.  My old iPod was so much better quality than this cheap imitation.  It has poor battery life and you can't play music from it in its original format.  You can get a better iPod in a day if you use a little extra care, but in return you get a cheaper product.  The video quality is fine but it's hardly a good idea to take a video while driving. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen looks very good.  I get it because I purchased it for my Sony Playstation 3.  The problem is that the power light goes out with no warning at all and has never been fixed.   My previous PS3s used the same Sony cable that came with my Sony TV.  This one is just as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this for my Mac Mini as a backup drive for my external hard drives.  It works well enough but there are a couple of things that are just horrible.   The first is that it's really small for a hard drive.  This is unfortunate since a large hard drive with a USB connection is much more useful.  The other bad thing is that the drive is formatted with FAT32 (which can be very problematic if your computer has a bad hard drive).  I have a Toshiba External Hard Drive that is formatted NTFS (for better performance) and it performs perfectly.  There are a few other problems as well but the FAT32 issue is a big one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I received the iPod, I was so happy. It had so many great features, and I loved that it was waterproof (but had to change it every now and then). Unfortunately, this little device is so unreliable that it is impossible to use without buying replacement parts for it every time I make a mistake. Every now and again, it will play a single song, but then it will get corrupted and won't play anything else until I find another copy of the same song. The battery doesn't last very long either. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing will not even work.   I bought this item because of the nice price and the fact that the included cables are designed to work with a plethora of different media players.  I use a variety of digital players and this model is no different.  It doesn't work with my iTunes player and I've looked everywhere.  A simple Google search shows that other people have had the same issue.  This model is a total waste of money and if I ever use another Sony player again, it will be a different model. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item on February 13, 2012. I tried it and it was a waste of money.  I got a defective USB cable that wouldn't work at all.  It was a great price, but not worth the time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This iPod doesn't play well with other devices I own, but it's not even an issue for me.  I got this because it's supposed to be perfect for my old iPod, but after a week, the video and music playback are still terrible.  It's like they made a crappy computer and stuck it in a bad MP3 player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a second-hand Philips CD player for my computer and it worked great.  Unfortunately, after about two months, it began to fail.

If there's anything wrong with the CD's, I can't find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item was defective after only a week of use.  I had just returned an iPhone 6 Plus after having the device serviced and it was faulty.  After searching for a replacement I realized I had an old Droid for my current phone.  The Droid came with the same software that this device came with (but not the same memory cards).  This Droid, on the other hand, came with a different operating system (Samsung's N7000).  The operating system on this device is very bad.   I have since tried to download the operating system off of the Droid and it failed.  It is so bad that it won't even open up.  When I try to download an application from the device, it says " The device is missing the required files ".  This is extremely frustrating because the phone is so much cheaper than the Droid (which is really quite bad, I don't think I could pay $200 for the Droid even after a year of use).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This little box is useless. It has a 1.5-megabyte internal hard drive and an SD card slot, which works great for saving music and photos but doesn't work at all for making music on my iPod.  They could have at least given me the ability to transfer music onto the SD card or some sort of USB adapter so I could copy files directly from the hard drive to the SD (something that is supposed to be easy, but which is always a hassle on my old iPod).  It's not even worth $5 because of the poor performance of the internal drive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using this as a backup to my Mac Pro for about 2 years now.  I use it for video editing, and streaming.  It works pretty well, but the USB cable keeps getting lost.  The most frustrating part about it is that it can't even read my hard drive.  No matter what I do, it can read the partition it's trying to boot from and show me a blank screen.   If it can detect a hard drive, it should have no problem reading it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is really bad. When I first got it, it came in an e-mail from Best Buy saying the unit is not working and that I need to call.   The device came in another e-mails telling me I need an RMA (return to sender).  When I called, the rep said they can only do that after I've made a payment.  I called back three more times but all I got was the same answer.  The rep has told me they cannot do it, I'll have to do it myself, and that it could take a while.  It's only now that I'm starting to think about the cost I'll be paying for that e-store transaction...

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a terrible electronic device. It works great for playing mp3s but the sound quality is so bad that you could cut out your CD player for this reason alone.

It also doesn't have a CD jack and has no input for a phone or other audio device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first two times I bought this unit I got a bad buzz from it, and it had a bad reputation because of this.  After that, I put a very large capacitor in the power supply to try to improve things, but even that wasn't enough, so I just replaced the capacitor with a much larger one and put the unit back together.  I'm not convinced it's the unit, but I think this is a good indicator that bad things will happen in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the moto x and had a few problems. The phone would never work properly, the usb to sd card is just awful, and the camera works just fine, but it's a pain to have to pull it out and use the usb cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First, the battery life is horrible. It's like trying to run a water heater with the lights off.  I used to buy batteries from T-Mobile and the power lasts about 2 years.  These new batteries are terrible. I've used them twice, but each time they don't last for a single day of heavy usage.  If I'm not using my phone for an hour or more every day, I end up with the battery dying after about 3 days.  This product should not be in the $80 to $200 range. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought two of these as replacements for a defective printer, and I am very disappointed with the quality. I've had other printers that are much better quality. They print much better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the Bose SoundTouch II a year ago, thinking it would be a great device to pair with my Bluetooth headset.  It was only about $15 more than a good Bluetooth headset, but that cost comes at a high price.  I never really liked my SoundTouch, and I couldn't figure out how to get it to work in any reasonable amount of time.  My headset stopped working last month, and it was an expensive one.  The only thing that was helpful was finding a decent alternative, but I didn't want to pay twice the price for the same device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit came as advertised and was very good quality.   But I was disappointed in the user interface.  It's too complex, too many features, and too many settings.  Even setting up the WiFi was confusing.  I could get it up and running, but then it would start to get very slow or wouldn't even recognize my password, making it impossible to use any of the WiFi features.  And even with the right passwords, I couldn't connect to the Internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got the Ener-G in early January and I love it. It's small, convenient, and it saves me the trouble of buying expensive cables. However, it's not as powerful as some of the other cables I've used and I've had to get used to having my computer go into sleep mode every couple of months to conserve power.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using my    for almost a year now, and it has a number of defects.   First of all, it doesn't work on Windows 8.  I've tried a number   of cables from different companies.  All of them were either too short or were hard to get into the right locations.  My   works fine on Windows 7, but I've gotten used to having a standard USB 2.0 connection to my computer.  This one doesn't even have a standard connector.  So, I don't recommend buying this  . 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My iPad 3 was fine with my previous tablet.   Then I got this one and it broke after one day 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My first Panasonic TC-P7500, it worked great until a few years ago, when the battery became useless. I replaced it with a different model that does work and I love the features of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a new USB thumb drive just to install this, but it didn't work, but I'm pretty sure that's because I don't have the latest software on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because my  Sony MP3 player would not work with my Panasonic HDTV.  The only way I could get it to work was to rip the sound from a video file, which I did.  Unfortunately, the sound quality was poor and the picture was grainy.  I'm using it to watch "Gone Girl" on my  Samsung DVD player and it's working great. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really excited about the new iPod because it will be much thinner than the previous ones. When I get it, I'll give you an honest review.  It's not.   The plastic that covers the metal connector, which is supposed to be a spring, is so cheap and flimsy that it bends easily and breaks very easily.  I also found that the "microSD" card that came with it is a very poor quality card.  The writing was very uneven and didn't look the same as the other cards I used.  Other than that, the new design is really cool, and the iPod is better than the other iPods I've used.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I had to use a wireless USB connection for a file transfer on my new Mac, I had my first, and maybe last, moment of regret. The device simply wouldn't work. I had just bought the dongle from an electronics store, thinking that I would probably have it working by now. It seems that most USB devices have some kind of "fuse" that should automatically cut off the power if the USB connector gets too hot. The USB dongles I used never had this feature, and when I plugged them in, they both quickly died. I returned them and bought a more expensive one from another store. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The headphone jack is really flimsy.  I got this device for my cell phone, and I have to twist the plastic part so it will fit.  It gets very hot when trying to connect to my computer, and my cell phones don't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received my   iPOD and it worked perfectly for about a week. After that, it would not turn on. I contacted  Apple  and they told me that it was  because the   device   is incompatible with   iTunes. I told them it was the  fault of my computer because I had the same problem. I  did some research  and found out that   many   PC laptops   have the same issues. When I received the  iPod again, it worked flawlessly!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm disappointed with this iPod   The design is awful   It is not able to hold a large amount of data  It only accepts 1/8" and 3/16" audio connectors   Instead of the iPod classic's connector, you have to buy a different connector for this 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this to use as a backup iPod, but I've found that the device has horrible quality control.  I've gotten a couple of new iPods that worked perfectly in about 3 days of use, and the last one only lasted about a month. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound quality is amazing, however the interface/controls don't work very well.  The buttons on the bottom control volume, playback and start up.  They don't seem to work, even when the unit is turned on.  I'm using an iPod, so I'm assuming they are supposed to be the same thing.  When the unit starts up it takes a few seconds for it to recognize my player.  At this point it has to go through a couple of different menus to find my player, which takes about a minute. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a Panasonic TC-18, and I'm not sure why. After purchasing the device, I was very disappointed in the lack of good software and user-friendly interface. I'm using it to record and watch video on my television and it's awful. I've been using WinAmp and it works fine but the TC-15 is terrible. It's hard to install and the only reason I went with the TC18 was because of it's excellent battery life. Unfortunately, it's a bad choice for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My first electronic device I ever purchased was a Sony Playstation 3, and after playing a few hours with that thing it got to be really sluggish.  The Wii U has been no better.  After spending several hours playing it I can no longer even play video games on it.   I wish the Wii U had the same software that the Playstation 3 has. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This   doesn't work very well.  I can't even use it to play the CD on my   portable player.  The cable is so  thin and flimsy that  the only way to connect it to my  portable is by using a special adapter that   you use with CD players.  It's really   disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My old TRS-80 is finally being released.  The unit itself is solid and very quiet.  There's only two knobs on the back panel: record and seek.  I'm not sure why it took Atari so long to create a true cassette deck.  While playing "The Star Spangled Banner", it sounds almost like the old Tandy TRS.  It doesn't give a good sampling of the audio, but it does a good job of playing my favorite tape from long ago.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this, I thought it was a great idea. I have a wireless audio receiver that I bought just because I can't stand wired systems. When I got it, I was disappointed. The receiver had a major flaw: if you connect it to a CD player (anyone with a CD changer should know this), then the volume control won't work, and the CD player won't play. The solution is to buy a new receiver.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm new to this "multimedia" stuff and really didn't expect much.   The unit is good enough for basic streaming and basic recording.  The only thing that keeps me from buying it is the fact that the software is so "sloppy" (or at least not designed with "the average consumer in mind").  I'll admit I don't really understand the differences between MP3 and AAC.  It doesn't even let me choose between them.  I've been using the same software for years and I'm sick of it.  Also, it's so easy to set up that I'll probably just use the included software, which is fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new iPod after a few years and it was a great upgrade.  I listened to my music on it at all times and was able to get to all the albums on my iPod from any place, even my computer.  However, after a month the iPod began to malfunction in very strange ways.  One day I woke up to find it had been wiped clean and all my music gone.  When I went to restore the files, my iPhone 4 also became unresponsive.  It would not turn on and would even stop vibrating.  After a week, I was forced to throw the whole iPod away.  At the time, I thought this was the end of my   love affair with my  iPod.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered two of these. One was defective and the other would not turn on at all. Both of them ended up being used as a USB drive. I have a lot of music on my laptop, but for some reason my CD player does not seem to recognize the drives. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My Sony Vaio was in terrible shape when I purchased it. The unit wouldn't turn on at all and the CD player would not record even the smallest part of the song.   It was also full of dead batteries.  I contacted Sony and they told me the battery was dead on the first attempt  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my computer because the old one is very noisy and there are no USB ports. This is not a bad piece of hardware but I had to buy another to use with my 3DS. The software crashes constantly and takes forever to load. I've been disappointed in this device every time I've bought it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This   is   the   worst   I've ever   bought.   It   doesn't   work   and   sucks   all   memory   like a   sponge.  I   don't    have   any   data   from   my   old   phones   so   it   isn't  helpful   when   i  need   to   find   something. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After I returned my old iPod to the store I was shocked to find out that I couldn't transfer my music from it to my newer iPod.  I tried to use an old cable that came with my iPod but it wouldn't work  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This iPod is the absolute WORST thing that I have ever purchased.  The video quality sucks!  This thing only has a single input port and it sucks! It even has a weird jacked-in jack for an extra headphone jack that is impossible to use!   Seriously, there is no way to play audio on it!  The batteries are so horrible that they will not last more than 4 songs in a row and will burn out in less than a week! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a nice piece of gear.  The sound quality is not great, but there are better sets out there.  Unfortunately the USB and micro SD cards are no longer being manufactured by them, and are only available from eBay.  This has severely reduced the amount of SD cards I can carry with me, and it will be difficult to have any other SD cards, even if I wanted to.  It will also be difficult for me to do backups in the future because my hard drive will likely be the last card I use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The original Apple watch was a huge disappointment   It was difficult to set up, the battery lasted less than a month, and when it did last, it died within three months.  It's much cheaper now and the Apple Watch 2 has a lot of new features, but I still can't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really excited to use my Kindle for about 4 weeks.  The first night I used it, I noticed that the cover had come off.  I assumed that the battery was dead and that I needed to get a new one.  Upon doing a hard reset, the cover was completely back on.  It turns out that the new battery had a different type of seal on it, so when the battery died, the old seal broke and the cover came off.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit arrived in less than a week, but the batteries   have a funny smell.   I have to put in new batteries every month 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My new Dell laptop is horrible. I really wanted this machine as a replacement for my aging but still functioning HP. It's sooooo slow and awful that I'm thinking I'll just return it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, the USB charging cable is way too short for my device to fit through (it was much longer than required). Secondly, the cable gets very hot after charging, which I can't stand. I've tried three different USB chargers, and these are the only ones that stay cool and don't get too hot.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It takes a long time to make sure all of the connections are secure, and it's not always clear who to ask to fix the problem. The sound quality is mediocre, even though it sounds better on the headphones.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first version of this came with the wrong batteries   After trying to replace the batteries, I found out that it is a terrible idea to buy different batteries for different applications, because the wrong ones will make your device not work.  When I tried the first one with the right batteries, the device would not connect at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have tried several brands of USB flash drives over the years but this one from B&H beats them all.  It's extremely fast and I can transfer and view photos on my Mac from my phone with ease.   The flash drive is also very small so it doesn't take up much space and it's easy to carry around with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't know how I could have been so terribly disappointed by this   It looked very nice and the quality of the electronics was excellent. However, after I turned it on, I was disappointed to see that the screen was very dim.  Even when I had it at night, I couldn't see the screen well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this set on a whim as I was running low on my last set of sd cards and they looked really good.  I figured it would take a while to load up the SD cards from the hard drives but when I first tried it, it took forever to load the files!  I finally figured it out and got it to work by removing the SD card from the drive and plugging it into my computer (which is my only computer).  The drive is very fast, so it's not a problem, but I am surprised that it took so long to load files from it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed when the unit came was the power supply. It came with one 12V power adapter and a one 5V power supply and an AC adaptor (which I used to power my laptop). But the power supplies both look the same. The original unit came with two 12V adapters. The other unit that came with mine had the wrong power adapter. I was unable to find the one that I wanted when I ordered the new one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device itself, while very good, is bad. It seems like the software doesn't like to write out its own ID (it should) so the app doesn't work. I've seen other users say the same thing and have had no problems. I haven't bought another bluetooth device, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing doesn't work.  I bought this to replace a broken wireless USB drive I bought a year ago.  It was so fast and so powerful, it made me forget about my other problems.  The day it failed, I had to download the entire Windows 7 OS to my backup drive (another bad purchase).  I still have that drive.  This time, I've had to turn off my computer and get another one to work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device seems good, but I returned it because the USB port is really hard to work with. The cable also seems very fragile and will fall out of the device any time it is in the pocket. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is useless for anything.   It just doesn't connect.  It's so easy to put it back together and then it's just like it was.  I have a couple other products from Apple that are way better quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this little bad boy for my iPad on a whim. I was looking for a way to capture sound from my speakers while riding my bike around. I bought it at a good price, and I'm glad I did.  However, the sound quality is just okay.  It has a good enough mic to pick up my own breath sound, but that doesn't cut it for me. It doesn't sound that good, but it's okay. It's great if you want to keep your music loud for riding around and recording audio.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The USB 3.0 card reader is very slow. I've gone back and forth between the SD card reader, and this.  The SD card, especially, is much faster. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A poor product:  After a week of use, the battery died within a week.  The card reader broke after less than a month, and the SD card would not work after two months.  It would not read a full set of data from a microSD card.  I gave up on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only good thing about the unit is that it connects directly to the AC adapter of a car. Otherwise it's a complete piece of junk that requires 3 adapters and has a weird little LED on the back that you have to physically turn off each time you use it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is junk    It is slow, unreliable, and poorly made.   The headphone jack is cheap plastic   In all other aspects, the sound quality is bad   If you are going to buy a portable speaker, you should get something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This phone has a bad name because of the terrible build quality.   The camera doesn't work, and it's a huge pain to remove it if you've dropped it and shattered it.  I also have to take off the SIM card and the SD card to make it work.  The screen  is almost useless as it is so clear.  It takes a while to load apps, and if you are playing games it takes forever to boot up.  And the battery takes forever. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the USB-to-Serial adapter for a new laptop a year ago and now I'm back to buy a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been using my   iPaq since November 2005.  It has worked perfectly for about a year and a half.  I get the impression that Apple has abandoned the   iPod as their top seller.   In addition, the  MP3 player and   computer card are no longer manufactured   and are no more available   from Apple.  In fact, I'm now looking into   buying a new   PC and a new USB stick. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing that I did wrong was that I used an SD card reader with my computer but instead of using it as intended, I formatted it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought my new iPod, I was very excited to finally be able to listen to my music through it.  When it arrived, it was pretty much like the photo above.  The packaging was so flimsy and flimsy it actually tore when I opened it up.  I wasn't even sure if the product was defective or what the deal was.  Then, when I tried to insert it in my iPod's case, it broke.  It's still in my case and I'm stuck with that ugly case.   I was so upset at that point I just threw the case away.  Maybe it's just me, but I just don't trust these devices. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought my Apple Wireless Keyboard for my laptop. The product came as advertised and works perfectly.

I wish I had purchased it from my local Apple Store. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPod is great in theory, but in practice it is useless.

I'd rather pay twice as much for an MP3 player that actually does what it's supposed to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was disappointed that I bought a cheap   computer that didn't come with a DVD drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first I ever used was an original Epson inkjet printer.  I was so excited to use it at work and at home, but the poor quality of the pictures caused my printer to break down about halfway through the first year.  It had a huge problem with paper tearing.   It never did much else well.  After that, I ditched the printer for any kind of digital printing.  The original Epsons I had from the '70s were better than anything else out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item for use in my new Sony a7R camera.   However, the lens is too wide for my use.  The lens makes the photos a little blurry in places.  I have to focus it really close to get even decent shots.  Also, there is a slight distortion to the photos in some of the pictures.  My a7 is no stranger to such lens distortion. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The cable is terrible. I have a Sony Vaio SRS-250 that works great with my Sony USB recorder. The SRS's are a little longer, and the cable plugs in tighter than it should. I had to return it because it would not record my daughter's playtime and I didn't want to risk having to pay for the cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been wanting a SONY Walkman for a long time.  It would just play music on my computer.  Then I got an iPod.  I had to wait until I could get a new TV before I could use an iPod, so I got the  Sony  Walkman (a black one, that is) and was really happy with it.   Then Sony made it worse by making it smaller and less powerful than   the iPod and by putting a crappy remote control in the middle  of it. I got rid of it before the new remote came out and now I'm using a  cheap  iPhone .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just bought this unit and it's terrible. The buttons work great but there's an   awful delay between pressing the button and the sound registering. It's so slow I can't even use it for a short period of time. I've owned many Bluetooth headphones and never had this problem, so it must be   something  about the  audio quality.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using an  HP  EliteBook 8540 for about 8 years.   The first couple times I bought it, I used the  USB port on the back and  plugged it in.  Every time I plugged it back in,  it became completely sluggish.  So I bought the  external  USB  port.  It worked immediately.  I am very happy with my   purchase. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem with this product is that you can't get a decent screwdriver out of the box. It just stays in your bag and you have to use the supplied driver to get it out.  It's so inconvenient that I just bought a new PC and will have to pay more to get a good screwdriver. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I love the convenience of having my camera on a tripod, but when I got the new Sony SLT camera and used it, I found out the battery is only good for 3 hours of shooting, so you have to plug it in to recharge.   They also got rid of the batteries on the camera when you turn the camera off, but that's annoying because you can't re-add them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery is not strong enough to last all day.  I keep going back to the wall charger for an extra battery, and the batteries in my other devices always last.  The SD card reader only reads FAT16, not NTFS or exFAT.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have used the Sony PCM-M9 for years to capture a CD, and I can say that it's always the first item I take out of a new computer and replace.  The only issue I've ever had is with the CD, which always fails to play in all my other CD players.  Now I don't have to throw out my old ones, because Sony will fix it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPod shuffle is the first Apple device I've had that did not hold a charge.  It stopped working just before Christmas.   I have been hoping Apple will offer a longer-lasting, more expensive version of the shuffle for years.
