Write a positive review about a good book:    If I were in college this would be one of my first books,  I have no idea why it has taken me so long to read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good example of a historical novel in the tradition of Cormac McCarthy, which also is about a character who was caught out by his own stupidity.   It's got the sort of atmosphere of a good spy novel in which the protagonist's stupidity is also the protagonist. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    After having read through a couple of books on the philosophy of Hegel, I found the book on Hegelian dialectics to be most important.   This book makes the dialectical method one of the main points of view that can lead to a genuine understanding of Hegel.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm so glad this book exists. It is so well-written and so relevant, and it speaks to my personal issues in a way that a lot of other books don't.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read.   It has everything a fantasy book should have:    well-crafted characters, engaging stories, and engaging characters who don't have the time to get into every little side story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not only a good description of the Jewish experience in the U.S., it's also one of the best descriptions of the contemporary American situation I've ever read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent, accessible, thorough introduction to mathematics.   The book is written by a mathematically trained mathematician (I had trouble telling the difference),  and he covers topics such as modular forms and homotopy theory.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It's not like you are reading a story about an old man in his 80s, but is instead about a young man who was part of a secret mission and who later goes on to have a life-long relationship with an old woman.  You can't really expect more from this type of book though, since it was based on the first person memoir of a child. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I am ever at a book party, I will be sure to bring a copy of "A Thousand Plateaus" by Ray Kurzweil.   I have had this book on my "must-read" list for about a year.  I always love the ideas that Kurzwin puts forth in this book.  It is a very thorough work that should be required reading in college. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't know if I am a huge fan of this book, but this is certainly one of the better fantasy tales I've read in the last year or so.   It's a fairly typical fantasy story about a small town in upstate New York that is invaded by aliens and turns into a war zone, but that doesn't take away from the writing or the interesting world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book that I bought from an author who uses the word "retrogressive" in the title.   He describes a time in history in which humans lived only as hunters and gatherers.  After the invention of farming, these people had to learn to farm, but then a new problem arose: how to make fire.  When they solved that problem, they had to figure out a new way to cook food.  I found this book interesting, but I still think that humans should have moved to a different area of the Earth before they learned how to farm.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was excited to get a copy of the new book by Michael Pollan,  How to Change Your Mind: A Guide to Personal Transformation.   While the book is written for a lay audience, it is the type of book that can be quite challenging to write about.   It's an excellent introduction to many different approaches to thinking about the mind and how it can be changed.  It has been a while since I read a good personal transformation book, and I really feel that this is the one that's going to help me most.  I think that one of the most difficult parts of personal transformation is the transition from feeling like you're "fixed" to thinking you "can't" change.  The first thing that I did when I read the book was write a detailed description of my life before and after I started taking medication.  For years I was in and out of many different mental health care facilities.  Eventually I decided I had been put on a very dangerous medication regimen that I wasn't quite happy with, but wasn't able to do much about, and decided to end the medication.    After I ended my medications I continued to be very depressed for a few months, but I've learned that you can't get back what you've lost by making a decision to give up.  By taking medications that helped me feel more productive and less depressed I got over the depression much more quickly than if I hadn't taken medication at all.  After taking medication for a while I started thinking more clearly and my ability to think clearly and quickly improved.  Since then I've been able to make big changes in my life.  One thing I realized is that people always say you can think more clearly if you have an enemy in your head, and for the most part I still get annoyed by that when it comes up, but now when I feel that the person I'm trying to think about is making my life worse I know that I have to move on.  So I'm pretty happy about that.  You might be interested in a similar book  that I recently read

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the better books I have read. It has a simple story that is well-paced and gripping.   It's a short read, but it's well worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been looking for a good story that shows the horrors that can happen when you try to tell a story that you haven't read first:  A guy gets in a car accident.  The doctors tell him he has a very high chance of death.  So he drinks a whole bottle of alcohol.  Then he has sex with a girl.  In the hospital, they show him he's not dying as they tried to.  (He's got a broken arm and a smashed leg and a broken finger.)    So a lot of stories that you read about people are actually true and tragic, in some cases.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good historical study of how an American revolutionary became a British soldier.   This book does a good job of telling the story of George Washington and other American revolutionaries from the Revolutionary War to the American Civil War, and showing the differences in the attitudes of the people involved and the differences between America and England. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first read this book, I was a bit annoyed that the main character, a woman who is in love with a man, doesn't have a similar reaction to her own father's death. It was a little too much like a modern-day romcom. However, as the story progressed and we learned more about the women's reactions to these tragedies, I became interested in their lives and relationships. It is well-written and easy to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent example of the new critical thinking that I have developed as a result of many years of studying and teaching.   It is a book about how people have been misleading us, about how it is possible to get information about a subject from the people in charge, about why the people who control information have been so successful in selling us their products. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      I am really enjoying this book.   I am trying to come up with ideas on how to use the internet more effectively.  It's hard to imagine a better way than having people go to a website and read a book that they already own but aren't interested in.  This book does exactly that.  I feel like I am better prepared now for a conversation I might have in the future about things I might do in a book or on the internet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a classic.   It's like the Bible, but a lot shorter: a series of vignettes that each deal with a different kind of suffering. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's interesting that one of the main characters, an atheist, becomes a practicing Christian in a very short time.   For me, the "fringe" is where I find religion the most interesting -- the "other side" of "the way things ought to be." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be very thorough in presenting the different theories on the development of the human brain, and there are also a number of examples of studies to demonstrate the validity of different models.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of the best of the many I've read about a former Mormon church.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read   this book   to my husband after my first two children were born.   The information about this and other topics in   his book  was   really helpful and   in-depth   for a first-time parent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very helpful in helping one to understand the different ways that people deal with emotions:  We all have a "happily" (happy) or "not-at-all" (not happy) moment in our lives.  Sometimes these feelings occur in predictable ways:  1.  We are "high" (a positive state of mind) or  "down" (negative state of thought)  2.  The person is angry (a negative emotion)    3.  It is an unpleasant time   4.  (The person does not "get it"   5.   (We cannot "unsee it" so to speak   6.  A negative  moment is followed by a positive one

Write a positive review about a good book:    The author, John F. C. Reilly, has a good way of presenting his thesis.   It is well-written, detailed, and thorough.  The first chapter is very helpful in showing the process of writing a short story.  I have been an editor for many years and have also had the benefit of the help of the staff of a popular fiction magazine.  Reilly has the same gift and is able to present his work in a way that a regular fiction editor could not.  His stories are so well researched that I found that I was not able to find anything in them I could not have learned from books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a classic from the old fashioned days of pulp fiction.

Write a positive review about a good book:    There is a good amount of information in this book on various topics, but the book's author, Gary L. Huse is a bit over-the-top. He is extremely negative and over-exaggerates some of his claims (in particular about "M.I.T. researchers").  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must read.   It will enlighten you about all the ways humans are different from each other and why that's good:  They're also very different from one another.  There's also a story about how I think about all of the differences I see.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished "The Book of Mormon," by Neal A. Maxwell, which is a very good introduction to the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a fan of Raffi's books and blog for a very long time.   One reason is that he never gives in to the temptation to tell the reader that they will be glad to get the book at a later date   He has always kept me going, however, by giving me what is likely the best writing I've ever read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read "The Great Gatsby" was in college. I went to a great public library and found a copy of "The Sun Also Rises" at the back.   My friend wanted to read the book on his way home from work.  I was surprised that she even wanted to have a go.  The book had a great cover, so I felt good about giving it a shot.  It wasn't long, and I learned a lot about the real story of the great Gatsbys.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first two chapters set up what the book is about:  I was looking for a book to help me understand the concept of God: how I can get to God by just doing things and being thankful for every little bit   However, the chapter I read on the concept (or, as it is written in the book: the 'concept of the concept') helped to establish a foundation for the whole book: it was clear that what he is talking about is about much more than just the concept   My only criticism: I think it's too easy to get bogged down in the details, and not fully understand what the author is talking a about (i.e. why it is important that we get to the concept...

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was surprised and disappointed by the end of the novel.   As I've read so many great science fiction, there are a few that stand out.  In this one, the author's descriptions are very good.  It is one of the most vivid descriptions of a solar system I've ever seen.  I wish the author would have gone further.  He should have described what it would be like to be a space shuttle. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found my first book by B.F. Skinner, The Science of Mental Illness   interesting as a psychological explanation of how the mind works. I don't want to give any more away than I already have, but the book also has several psychological experiments demonstrating how the human mind works, and I found the theory presented in it interesting and worthwhile.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent, clear, and informative book about the origins of modernity.   In fact, there's a nice example in the beginning:  The story of modern English is the story of how the language's gradual loss of power (from the church and the nobility to the   populace at large) was not just   accidental:  It was a deliberate result  of the very structure  of modern  society.  This shows us a lot about our present  civilization:  One of the great things about modernity is that  it has succeeded at making the  world less complex.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great one about the rise and fall of the first great Western civilization, from the Roman empire to the Protestant Reformation.   It does not explain the rise of Protestantism, but instead, looks at its failure and how this was rooted in its failure to understand that it was a great civilization.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, a very nice little book about the "Mormon" history that has been widely presented in recent years.   The book is written by one "theologically inclined, non-Mormon professor," so the book has an  extremely   very nice style, and is not at all biased or otherwise misleading.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As I mentioned in my review of The War of Art, I'd recommend this book as an antidote to the more common bad reading:  One can't help but notice that all the authors I've read on the topic end up emphasizing one thing, which is to say that most people are really pretty bad.   I think this isn't as much a problem with most people as it is a symptom of the fact that most good writers don't emphasize that point.  I like my books to be about something more than just how pretty they are:

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book on the history of the United States that covers the first years of our republic. It is well-researched, and shows how the founding fathers were influenced by the British constitution. The book is divided into four parts, and each one shows more clearly the origin and influence of certain key decisions. This is the first time I have read a book that shows both the British and American constitutional systems closely in contrast and the influence they both had on each other. It's good to see that the American revolutionaries were interested in the development of the British system.

However, I found myself enjoying this book a lot.  I'm not normally a fan of military fiction, but I found that this book is one of the best I've read in years.  The characters were interesting and their struggle to find themselves interesting.  Some of the language was a bit harsh, but it was a good change of pace.

If a program that was being broadcast on the network was deemed as   offensive to some (i.e. racism), the network could demand that the station get a different station to carry that program.  The FCC has had   rules about   the content of some programs (i say "some") for a while now,   but it seems that the rules are just about to go a bit too far,  and that it's time to say that   there's no place for   such programming on network television anymore.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most beautifully written book I've read about the creation of the Internet:  The book is a tour de force of writing and research, with many new facts.   The information and figures are presented as facts:  Google's original description is "The first Internet-based encyclopedia was created on October 12, 1993," as if it were the most recent event in the history of the world.  In fact, the original article was published in Science magazine on October 10, 1993.  Google, it turns out, created the first Google:  It's all well and good to use the Internet as a "way to get out of having to remember what you did yesterday," as author Larry Lessig put it, but what about the many other ways in which the Internet makes life easier:  Why can't everyone write their Wikipedia entries using only their Gmail address?   Why does it cost $5 to add a photo to the Wikipedia entry?  Does every Google search lead to a link to a Wikipedia page?  Can the fact that Wikipedia's articles are written by a handful of non-native English speakers really be considered a problem, even though people in the US can now get an American version of the English Wikipedia?  Why didn't Wikipedia's founder just tell the world how he really came up with the idea?

Write a positive review about a good book:   I first saw "Moby Dick" in the library in college. It was one of the few books I hadn't read and had no interest in. I gave up on it and never read another book.   But about a year ago I was looking for a book on pirates and had a good feeling about "Merry Fellows."   It's a great book about the development of the crew during the expedition and their survival after their shipwreck in a small ship that is run aground on a sandbar. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I've ever read.   It's simple, but it's not.  It covers a lot of ground, and it does so well.  Even as someone who has little experience in this area, I find myself thoroughly enjoying it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a bit surprised by the book because I did not expect it to be so good.   The subject of the book is the "discovery" of the "Great Mistake" in the U.S. of doing nothing to stop the spread of the polio virus.  I was skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised when the story was told well and it was clear how much the "mistake" was bad and how it affected the people of the U  I was not impressed with this book.  It was mostly "history" about a lot of people who did very little but nothing to help the people who were infected.  They got nothing but grief and were mocked by others and ignored by the government.  There are also numerous references about other people trying to find cures and not getting any.  For example, the doctors who were trying to make a cure were not given much respect and were often derided.  My question for the author is whether he considered that a reason to do nothing but nothing?  I do not know what he thinks happened to all of these people and I do hope he will get back to us to tell us. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book!   It is an excellent work of fiction with a terrific cast of characters.    You get to learn a lot about a whole range of issues and people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As someone who has always enjoyed good novels, the one I picked up last night on my way home from a date is worth every penny. I just finished it in one sitting.   This is a book about the life of a man who can't seem to get rid of a horrible and annoying friend, a friend who is so stuck in the past he can't even see the future and, most of all, a good friend who knows just how to bring out the best in his friend.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about two young people, a girl named Molly and a boy named Tommy, who live in a small town. They live apart from the other kids, and their lives are quite different.   As the book opens, Molly has fallen in love with Tommy.  They live in small town, but they have good friends and there is no bullying.      Although the book is pretty well written, I had some problems with the details. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is a wonderful book.   It   brings   together   all   the   major   themes   of   libertarianism.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a detailed account of the life of the late, great William Styron.   It is the story of Styron's relationship with the great feminist writer Virginia Woolf, a close friend of his wife.  There is nothing that can be written about the life and work of William Styro that could not also be written of the great author, Virginia Woolley. Both men were born into great wealth, both of them went on to the heights of literature and both were influenced by the brilliant women in their lives.

Write a positive review about a good book:        I read this book years ago, as a student in college.   As a college student I had to go to classes to be able to read, so I spent a lot of time reading.  This book is very well written, and has lots of interesting things to say about different topics.  The cover is the perfect size to cover all of the pages, but the hard copy is also beautiful.  It's a little pricey but it's well worth it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read many of the novels written by the brilliant, but also often confusing, British author Christopher Buechner.  But, as is usual for such novels, I had trouble with this one.   The plot is confusing and the characters hard to like.  It was the second book in a trilogy.  I was hoping that this would be the last book in the series but that didn't happen.

One of the reasons I chose to start with The Dragon in Winter is that   I'd always thought it would be   a bad book,   but I'd never have   tried   the story, so I was   totally   thrilled   to get a chance to read it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in a rut a couple years ago.  It started with the fact that  I have a hard time following  my own  rules.  My  personality  doesn't  seem to match up  to the job  I want to do.   So,   my agent and I  brainstormed ideas.  So I came up with  a business plan.  I'm  writing  a novel  called  Caught in the Web  (available as an audiobook  under the title  The Caught Bug ).   (Also available as a Kindle ebook, but I'm not yet convinced that it's  a good option for someone like me.  )   As for the book title:  I didn't come up with it.  Instead,  my co-author (who wrote the  book  Underwater ) came up  with it,  and it's one of those things  that comes easily to  her.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a book recently called The Boy Who Would Be King   in which the narrator is a child and the parents do not know that he is a boy.   The story ends with the child's mother being killed and the boy's father sent away.  I thought that the author had the child wrong, that it would be more appropriate for the boy to know that his parents are aware that he has been born in the wrong body.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book as a review copy from the publisher.   The book is a very readable story about the great Russian painter Vasily Pudovkin, about his many loves.  Vasily was the ultimate "dandy", a dandy in every sense of the word.  He liked very young men (I remember in high school having one class discussion about his "foolish" decision to take a handsome, handsome classmate who was "very funny" to his first dance), he liked beautiful women (he was a total "bachelor" until he met the beautiful Russian actress Dima), and he liked the most beautiful women in the world: his beloved Dima.  In short, he was everything a gentleman could be.  The first time I read about this "love triangle" and Vasily's attempts to win Dima and the girl for himself (which of course did not work), I found it so sad and hard to believe it was true.  This book is not a true story about Pudoffkin's love life or his personal life, but rather a history book about the history of art, which is the basis of all good art.

Write a positive review about a good book:    While I disagree with his view on the Holocaust, I think it is useful to recognize it as a phenomenon of the 20th century.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book a couple of years ago and I just have to say that I'm a huge fan of this book.   This is an awesome book about a guy who was once a successful (if somewhat dysfunctional) musician.  He had a huge hit with a cover of a song by a famous rock band.  Eventually he became a successful real estate developer.  But a few years after his success, he is in a bitter divorce.  In his mind, he can't leave his wife.  So he spends his time working on his record company, even though he's not making any money.  This book gives you his thoughts about what is going on in his head, and the end results.  It's like a therapy session you'd find in a book or a TV show.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, The Girl Who Cried Wolf is one of the most compelling biographies ever written about a famous psychic.   She began by noting that "many historians and scientists have speculated about the origin of the Wolf myth," but that "the origin is not hard to find. It is in the folklore of a large and widely dispersed group of people known as the New England people, who lived in the middle part of the nineteenth century.  The legend of the wolf is old in these parts, but is in a more modern form than most New England folklore; and the Wolf was, in this case, a person who had become'mad' and who was believed to have killed children in order to survive."   The Wolf myth "was in a way an early precursor to the contemporary psychics that had a great influence on people in that same period.      She went on to explain that the Wolf in this tale was a child whose parents did not believe him, and who in revenge killed his own mother when she found out.  As in many stories about psychics, however, the Wolf got a second chance when he was shown that he would not be dead after all.  The whole saga became the basis of a folktale about two brothers who live in the woods and take turns being the wolf.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't really get into romance as much as I used to, but this book is a good example of how to do it.   The plot follows the typical romance trope: young people have a lot of trouble in their lives, but they somehow overcome it all and become friends and lovers.  I was expecting a romance between the two main characters (a boy and a girl) but the story instead takes a different path.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because I wanted to learn about and try to live by the ancient Greek tradition of medicine. This book, written by Dr. Robert M.

It's filled with examples of good medical practice that modern people can learn from and that are common-sense and rational. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so nervous to begin reading the book.  I had heard that the first book in the series had been a major disappointment and I was afraid that would be the case here too.   Unfortunately, I'm glad to say that wasn't the case.  As someone who doesn't like to read much, this book was a revelation.  The characters were well-developed and I really connected with them.  Although I am a fan of fantasy, this series reminded me of the world depicted in Peter V. Brett's novel,   The Lord of the Rings.  And although the book itself was a little slow, it was well worth the read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    For the first time in a while I'm happy with the story, despite the fact that the "gifts" are so underwhelming.   I have a bunch of problems with the plot.  I don't like the fact we get the "wish" (for the children to grow up to be a married couple) and the "promise" (that we'll always remember them as "willing and kind to anyone").  But, hey, we have a happy ending in the end.  And, as the author says, it's not really about the "reward" (what the "kids" get), but about the desire to make the children (and you) happy.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised that I felt this book was written well, and in a way that was fun to read.   It's a story about a boy and girl who get sent away to boarding school together as a punishment.  The girl becomes his best friend at first.  It takes a while to get used to her being different than everyone else.  They both end up with the same teacher, but one is less happy about that.

His focus is on a specific type of memory--nervous system (motor) memories--and how they relate to various cognitive disorders.  What struck me, too, is how little the brain has to do with the rest of the body.  It is amazing that there are people who believe that the brain controls all aspects of how the body moves.  I really think it has more to do to do  with where we eat  or where we sleep  than how we move.  As for me, I am a happy, healthy, walking, talking person with a wonderful sense of humor.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is well-written and well-researched.   I have been interested in the area of "social psychology" for over thirty years, but have never had time to follow up on the research on it.  I read this book with a great deal of enthusiasm, and it is my first exposure to the work of Buss.  This is a very good book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I started reading this book, I felt like I would get bored after a while.   However, I think the book has great potential.  A great writer like T.S. Eliot   could have come up with something new and innovative like this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most wonderful part about reading this book is not only how well it is written and how eloquent the author is in her descriptions, but also in the way she has made it clear how far she believes feminism has come since the day we learned about it.   And her analysis of why it has been so hard to reach women on a global scale.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As a young adult who is a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, I was thrilled when a book about Snape's love for Lily Potter appeared in the library.   I couldn't get my brain around that Snape couldn't just be a jealous man that loves Lily.  It wasn't until I read this that I realized Snape could have some kind of real love for her as well, but the way they were married and living in the wizard world was the most natural thing in the world to him.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is about what really matters in the lives of people, how and why they think about the future, how they perceive reality and their own identity, why people don't always act well together, how love and fear can be mutually satisfying, why we are never really happy, and how one person's happiness can affect everyone's happiness.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    First, I had no idea that the original version of this book was published before the copyright on it expired.   The book is really quite good.  There is an awful lot of good information, particularly about the Vietnam War (and the American anti-war movement).   It would be a good addition to any serious student's book shelf. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      This book should be required reading in every high school English class.   When I'm at a friend's house with some friends and I have to write a short review of a good work, I always pick this one.  It's a good summary of some of the more important themes in English literature in the first half of the 20th century:  I'm glad I read it when I did. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First of all, this is an excellent book about the art of living a positive, meaningful life. I read it right after having a nervous breakdown, and as I was going through the process of writing a thank you letter to a person I had harmed, this book gave me courage.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you want a laugh, read "The Book of Henry."   The author, David Foster Wallace, had to rewrite part of the book in order to get it published in the anthology "A Beautiful Darkness," but the book is very funny and is worth every penny.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I read this as a freshman. It was my first time reading a book of poems.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was disappointed in this book, but I did enjoy it.   After being a huge fan of George R.R. Martin's books since the first book in the series was published in 1987, this new book was not what I expected at all.  However, the writing of this book is so much better than the first two, which was the only reason I even bothered to try this book.  It's still a bit hard to believe it's actually been 25 years since the last book in this series was released. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book back in June 2011 when I was in the midst of a midlife crisis, having recently lost my job.   It was one of those books that reminded me to take a step back and think about what's really important in life.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In a lot of ways the story is reminiscent of the stories in The Wild and Wonderful White Horses: there is a young boy who makes a wish, the wish is granted and he goes to a place where he discovers a wonderful magic that is much more advanced than his own.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a child, a friend's grandmother gave me a copy of a children's book, one of those books which the publisher had to write about in order to sell more books.   The book was about a kid who made a wish that he wouldn't grow up, and the author came up with an imaginative solution:  Instead of growing up, he could go through the things he liked   more   than others.  I love that the author is kind about his own life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is a fascinating look at a case that is often overlooked in the public eye, but it is also a lesson in how to behave when dealing with women: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a great read. It's easy to read and not complicated. It doesn't feel like the author is trying to be a "super hero," but more like the "regular guy" who is able to see the world in a different way.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a book recently that helped me see through the fog of depression and suicide.   It helped me realize that the thing that most scares people most is the fear that they are not "good enough."   You can't be perfect all the time; if you are, you don't deserve to be loved. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book many times now but never purchased it.   This is the third or fourth time I have ordered it, only to find I don't have the time or the interest to get through it.... 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've had this book since it was first published in 1980. I have reread it on occasion and   now understand   some of the   history of the Jewish community in   Manhattan in the 19th   century.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was my first introduction to the world of animal rights.    I was immediately impressed by the detail and the thoroughness of the documentation, but the arguments didn't convince me.  I do think it is important to study the history of animal studies as it relates to this kind of work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story was well written.  It had a lot of action.   I liked the setting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      I enjoyed the book a lot.   The characters are believable and believable characters will not be the only thing a reader expects to be interesting in a story.  I'm going to try and learn a bit more about the Norse and their gods and hope to learn some more about their mythology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you want to learn a lot about the history of art, this is the book for you.   I've been intrigued by the history and art of painting for years, but never bothered to read about it in a book.  When my art teacher sent me a sample of my paintings, I couldn't wait to find out more.  I now know that there were many different approaches used by different artists.  After I finished reading this book, I had a new appreciation of the different methods that were used by artists.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I read this in one sitting and was completely in love with it. It's easy to be attracted to someone's positive qualities but hard to understand why someone would find flaws in the positive attributes.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've never met a woman who's not a bit intimidated by the notion of a man who has taken up a pen and writes poetry. But there's no way to hide this in a conversation with a man.   There's no doubt in my mind that I'm going to get a lot more enjoyment out of a book called "The Art of the Good Poem" than I did from "What Women Want"   
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this excellent volume on the history of the Jewish people the authors, the editors, the reviewers, and the translators have worked very hard to create a well-rounded and informative book, that is at least not too polemical in style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a young adult in the mid-1990s I went to a friend's house for a Christmas party. It turned out the house was a bit of a dump. It smelled strongly of cat urine, had a broken oven, and most of the decor was tatty from the last person who lived there. But one of the family members lived in a trailer, so it made a kind of sense. When I walked through the house I felt a bit like I was back in school and felt like an impostor trying to do a real party.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I read the book, I thought it would have been very interesting to compare the historical and psychological analysis of different types of mental illness with a more recent theory about the development of "neurotic" personality  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books where you just want to give it all away.   I just wanted a chance to say how happy I am that the author   did it right.  The book is a true story, but also a love story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good novel, and that's saying a lot. I've read many short stories but none so good as this one.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book a few months back, and it's about time. It's not about the politics of the day, but about the deeper philosophical problems of the Western spiritual traditions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed   the "R" in   The Lord of the Rings  . It's a little more memorable than   "Rings"   by E.E. "Doc" Smith, which seems   more like a parody of a fantasy book   than a   serious one.   Also,   you really get   a sense that this is the   real deal in terms of   its quality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my second time reading this book. I'd read the first one back in 2001.   The main idea of this book is that the world has changed since the 1970s.  The world seems like an easier place to live in, which is a great thing to know. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like the way this book deals with the nature of memory.   It is not, I think, very practical, or necessarily more correct than other attempts, but it is a nice addition to the "memory" literature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's hard to believe that it's been thirty years since I read a good non-genre novel.   This was the first time I've felt anything close to that, and I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an outstanding review of the history of political thought:  It is the only one I know that describes the evolution of a political theory in a way that makes it seem both true and original.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was initially worried that I would not like this book. I read through several other reviews and I think this one is a good one. I found this to be a very informative book about religion. I think that if you read a couple of books on the subject, you will get an appreciation of how the religion has affected a couple people and how it has been the cause of conflict. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First of all:  The plot, while not original, is a good one.  The writing style is very good:  One sentence after another is the reason I keep coming back to this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was intrigued by this book because it seemed to take a very similar approach to the other books I've read, but I'm still waiting for the other two to come out.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very disappointed in the book when I started it, but I quickly changed my mind when I became captivated with its portrayal of a "post-scarcity" society.   It is hard to imagine a society without a market.  What other resource do we not have at our disposal to pay people directly for their work?   What would we do without it?  I am a little worried about a future where we all work for the same company,  but I'm looking forward to reading more about that.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Art of Fielding: A Field Book of Practical Baseball Advice" is written by a person who has actually played a major-league game.   I love the way that a book about baseball can be so very personal:  The art of throwing:  If you can throw with a curveball and a slider (as I can) then you can get by with a fastball.  A good pitcher's best friend:  I find a good breaking ball at the bottom of the strike zone and a good changeup at the top of the zone to be pretty equal.  The first makes the batters swing, but the latter is harder to hit.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the only book I've read about the great Depression that's not written by a former economic adviser to George H. W. Bush. It's a real shame that so few people in today's culture take the time to get to know the Depression--and how they handled it. This is a real eye-opener. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a little tricky to explain why I like this book, but the reason is that it makes a strong argument that it's possible to live a meaningful and rewarding life without religion.   For me, and for other atheists, that's what religion is: a crutch.  It allows us to live for short periods of time but then we die with no idea of what's coming next.  This book is a good reminder that you can find a more meaningful life without organized religion.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you don't know the background, it's really hard to know how to judge this book as anything but a bad attempt to try to make sense of our culture and how we think.     If you can get past the surface level weirdness (weirdly sexist, weirdly racist, weird sexist, weird misogynist,   weird sexual fetishist, and strange sexless)  , you can probably find good things to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an amazing, important book.   If you are going to read a book like this, you may want to take it with a grain of salt and wait for it to be finished and published.  The book makes a very strong case for a more democratic political system than the one we have right now.  This should be required reading in high school as a class on democracy.

His story shows the human element of life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I had just finished watching the movie version of The Shining.    The movie version has some flaws but it's a much better movie than the novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I'm ever in a rush (not that I always am)   I can't get enough of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As the author's other books are of such high quality, I was looking forward to reading The Power Broker as it was my first exposure to the author.   A brilliant historical novel   and it is the perfect complement to the excellent   series by John Grisham.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book quite a bit.   There were a few minor flaws, such as the constant reference to "Grimms", which seems like a bit of a cop out.  But I had a blast reading this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading this book. It is clear, and concise, which is very refreshing. I did enjoy the introduction, which was interesting and provided some background information on what the subject was about.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been trying to read and re-read this book for some time.     It is, I think, my favorite historical novel of the century.  I would highly recommend it to anyone with a passion for the American West. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters in this novel, although not as complex or interesting as some, are just as compelling.   I found that the characters are so well developed that you can't take them all out of their characters and put them into a box and say, "I can't do anything about this."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so good that I have to buy all the other books that she has published.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was surprised to find this book so useful.   The author has made me look at the book from different angles. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited when I got my copy of The Catcher in the Rye   that I almost couldn't get through it.       The first sentence of the book makes the rest of it stand out:  I am sorry about that.  It is a lie to say that I have not had my own doubts about him.  I have.  When he was born, the doctor warned that my husband's liver would fail and that the baby would probably die.  The only good thing about the doctor's warning was that I didn't have to carry the baby to the hospital; it was taken by my mother.  But it has been more than fifteen years,  and the disease has progressed to the point where my husband is now a vegetable.  My son has never talked about it to me; it is very hard for me to believe that he has not found some way  to keep the disease at bay.  In the end, however, my husband made the right choice, and he is now in the midst of a quiet life in an old farmhouse with his daughter and a handsome farm boy, who seems to know him well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive book I've ever encountered about the history of the Nazi movement and the Holocaust. The Nazi regime was the greatest social and cultural evil of the 20th century.  It deserves to be studied, if only because the fact that it is a fact is so shocking to people today that they refuse to admit that something as awful as the Holocaust ever occurred.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am having trouble putting down this book.   After the first two hundred pages, I got very interested in the characters and in the plot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this one before taking a vacation. It's a good companion for an epic story that's really long. It has a lot of details about the place the story takes place in. I think it's a great book for someone that wants to know about the history of a place.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent guide to using the tools I use to take good pictures and make beautiful photos.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a field where books about religion are rare, this one stands out.   This book has something of the "how to" written in it, but not in the usual manner. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been wanting to read a good thriller for a while now, and I am glad that it came to me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A book I had heard about but never read:  The whole book is very funny.  It also has many good, interesting ideas about how to learn.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book with very few flaws.   The book is not perfect and may need some further work before it is ready to go into print, but so far it has been a very helpful book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have read on the history of the First Amendment  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this entertaining and informative book, William G. Bowen takes readers behind the scenes at the World Bank in New York to tell the story of how one of its first initiatives was to encourage countries to abandon an old and costly currency.   The author provides us with fascinating insights into the workings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Health Organization (WHO), among others.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the book before starting a new job in which I can't use a computer. This book made it very easy to switch to using a computer instead of a keyboard and mouse.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic book that really does show how our human experience is different from other species.   I feel a lot more comfort in knowing that the other creatures I encounter will never harm me or my loved ones.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading The Complete Works of T.S. Eliot since a very early age.   The first time I ever heard it, I was 14 and it was on the radio while I was at my grandma's house in Chicago.  I was blown away at the amazing quality of the words and how beautiful Eliot's prose was.  His poetry always impressed me more than anything else.  Even though it's not an English  book,  Eliot's ideas of "transformation" and "sublimation" resonate with us all and are something I try to keep in my life  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason I've never bought a nonfiction book that's been reviewed is that the reviewer is invariably   a   bad  .   She's   often   off   about   the   details   of   her   opinion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is a very good reason why you should never start a book with a preface:  The preface is a pointless and self-indulgent gesture by the author (who presumably is not very good at writing).  I had no problem with the preface,  but I had to laugh when the author started complaining about the difficulty of the book: "This is not a book to be finished in one sitting.  I read the entire book on my commute,   and  I have had it for months."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got the chance to read this book during a break from a very stressful day. It was a very timely book.   It's good for reading on the bus, when you just want to get things off your chest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this book   was   back in the '90s    when I was in my early twenties. I had come back from studying in Japan   to write a novel about a young Japanese woman who becomes a translator   for a European novelist.   At the time, I knew nothing about Japanese culture, but I thought the book was well written and told well enough   that I might write a follow-up   about the author and her life.  It took me a while, but a few years ago   I reread   this book, and I was impressed   even more   with the depth   the author brings to her subject matter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept for this book is interesting and compelling.   It is a good read that takes a few hours to finish. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a bit disappointed in this book when I first got it.    It was a good idea, but the execution was flawed.      The book is about the evolution of the brain from the most primitive and primitive parts to the most sophisticated and sophisticated.  I would have been better off reading about the most advanced forms of life on earth   such as humans or gorillas. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a quick read   that shows the author at the top of her game   with a good sense of humor and a clear eye   on the social    aspects   of writing.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a great time reading this book: a well-written story about how the government tried to cover up the sexual assault and rape of a schoolgirl by a popular athlete.   It has the same feel as the popular books about this topic: the sports heroes are often innocent or innocent-like, the villain is guilty, and a lot of bad things go wrong. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a fan of the books by Robert Greene, especially The 48 Laws of Power

Write a positive review about a good book:   A book about the lives of the great American artists. I don't think this is meant to be a serious biography - I think it's a fun, accessible portrait of an age, a time when many people had a genuine love of the arts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is probably the best book I've read in a long time.   It's a good primer on the basics of writing that will go a long way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I lived in New England I would buy a copy of " The Art of the Deal." It would be a book about an important American statesman.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a fan of George R.R. Martin, I was very disappointed with this book. It's the one where the dead were still alive.   Unfortunately, this book was also the only one I read that didn't bother to inform me of the "twist" in the last line of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book: a great example of using historical sources to explain modern cultural issues.   While the subject matter is a bit dated (a bit too political) and the writing is not that great  , I still enjoyed the book  . 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful - and quite possibly one of the greatest of all time.   It shows how the world is, in so many ways, an example of how society (and not just the church) is controlled by a few very wealthy and powerful people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book!   It was so well done!  My son loved reading it too.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is very difficult to read a book about the Middle Ages when your knowledge of the Middle East is limited to the TV series Game of Thrones   (if I am to understand correctly, I was the only person who knew the exact name of the book's protagonist, and the only other person who had read it), but I found the book to be very interesting and quite engaging.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book before I got married in 1999 and it made a big difference.   My husband is a good cook,   but never really cared for the food   at a local restaurant   in the early years of our marriage.  The book   had a lot to say about   a lot of   things, but   particularly about  food   that   was important   to us. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite novel 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first ever review so please feel free to correct me if there's anything I've got wrong, and I'm pretty sure I've left out some important details, or there's an inconsistency between the various chapters...  ... but as I read through this novel I realized that it wasn't written as a novel at all, it was written as two different novels - one set in the present, one set between the present and the future.    In other words, a story about what could have been instead of a story from the future about what was going to be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really good 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading a good number of the old Robert Heinlein books (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress  and  Starship Troopers  both being Heinlein's first science fiction novel, so they are a good gateway into the genre for me), and I really like Heinlein. I think he's a very strong writer, and this is a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    After years of struggling with my faith and my sexuality, I finally finished  The Gay Christian's Handbook.   I'm glad I read this book!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a bit disappointed that there isn't a good, straightforward analysis of this book that's been available online (or, rather, on Amazon).    This book does a great job of explaining how modernist architecture began to emerge as a new kind of architectural style.     It also covers the various critiques of modernist buildings and architecture as well.     
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is a great narrator:  As an experienced amateur photographer, I've long been frustrated with the inability of most professional camera manufacturers to develop a quality interchangeable lens system for entry level DSLR's that's not too heavy or complicated for the average user.   My favorite camera is the Ricoh GR (Ricoh is a subsidiary of Canon) and I think that the GR is a wonderful addition to any photographic toolkit.  However, I want to make sure that it doesn't hurt the quality of the camera:  I've been using a Nikon 1 J5 for a few years now.  For years, I found that using a J5 camera in manual mode resulted in camera shake and blur at very high aperture and wide angle lenses.  The J5's shutter was a constant 4.5 seconds and it produced the same image quality and noise as a 1.4x telephoto lens.  That was about it.  With the J5, I was able to get usable photographs at all aperture settings and at all distances with a wide angle lens.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "We live in a society that is in a state of constant crisis. Yet this state is also one of crisis of conscience. A good deal of modern culture—in advertising, fashion, music, and so on—is based on the idea that nothing is true and everything is false. We are told, for example, that it is impossible to have a healthy relationship with your mother. This is obviously true in the extreme. But why should such an assertion be taken seriously?" 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book. The writing is superb and makes the material all the more important.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I    is a great book.   It   has   many   good   parts   but   at the same time   it   is   in   the   wrong   style   of   writing   about   philosophy  . 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the first two chapters of   Grizzly Man  about a grizzly bear, and then just kept reading.   It is a gripping, suspenseful novel about the destruction of a bear's den.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the kind of book you can use as a good reference to some of the great literature in the past, but don't read without the context provided.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character of this book is a person who tries his best to stay out of other people's way.   If you try your best to avoid others, they will avoid you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As my husband and I read this book together, we agreed that the writing was excellent. The narration was also very well done.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this a while ago and loved it.   The main character is an old man who is in a wheelchair.  He has a wife, a daughter and two granddaughters.  As I read he said:  "We are born to be happy; to have happiness is to be blessed".    If you live in a place that is more happy than your old home - you are born with a disability.  I found it interesting how some people were quite rude about a handicapped person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about how to build a successful consulting firm.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My daughter was just about to start her junior year of high school when she was introduced to a new book.   It was an encyclopedia of magic tricks  .  It seemed like a good idea at the time and she enjoyed the process of learning tricks and finding the tricks in books, but as the time went on, the book made her think of the things that she couldn't do.  It also made her question what kind of person she wanted to be: 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book   It is a fascinating look at how human beings, particularly the rich, are able to become so rich.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't really like horror, but this was a pretty good book.   In my opinion, horror can be a very depressing experience, especially when the story involves murder.  A good writer can make a book entertaining, and at least make the story less bleak. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has a lot of positive stuff in it, like the interesting thing about a group of women who decide to take a hike in a remote valley: that while they were hiking, the group had been talking about how their husbands wouldn't talk to them about sex at all, because they are the "other" sex. It makes you realize how many of us men (and I don't mean just the married ones, either) are not allowed to talk about sex when we want to.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading this book I was very surprised to see the amount of information I had to take in to be able to put it all together.  I knew the name of some of the players in the book from a previous version, but that was it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy books about people, then you will like this book  .   The author manages to tell a story that is extremely relevant to current events in a way that makes me wonder whether she is exaggerating or not.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am in the process of reading a new book, The Second Life of a Wall Street Executive.   It's the story of Michael Milken, the legendary manager of junk bonds (I don't know why we have to call that 'bonds' anymore) and the author of the infamous Milken book The Insider.  It sounds like a good story.   The book covers the history of his life and career with some interesting details, but I am most concerned with the following passage:  "As he was leaving the offices of the bank that he'd built from nothing, he found himself alone. In a way, he was still that guy. He still went into meetings with a business-casual attitude; he still listened to the numbers that they provided him.  He still asked about the future and wanted to know what the company's strategy would be."  The phrase "business-casually attitude" is just a classic Wall Street cliché:  I don't like it, but that's how it's always been. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like the concept of this book.   It's well written.  It uses a good number of examples to make its point.  I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading the first few chapters in this book, I began to wonder whether some of the more outrageous claims were true. I am also a student of the paranormal and have a few skeptic friends. They have been having problems with some of these beliefs, but not with the rest.   The book was very interesting, but I cannot endorse it highly enough. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was thrilled when I found this book!   This is the second time I've read an autobiography, and both were very impressive.   The first was by the great writer Norman Mailer about the time he spent in the Vietnam war.     This book is much the same, but instead of Mailer telling us what it's like to live a war life, it's about the experience of being a prisoner of war (POW).   It's a great read, though, and a great reminder that we can't always do things for the sake of doing them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good, easy read. The book provides a nice introduction to both the philosophy and the practice of mindfulness, which is a way of life that allows people to live with less stress. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It gave me a good insight to what women really do in their relationships.  It is very interesting and I think women should know that they are just as likely to love a bad guy as a good guy  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently bought this book because it reminded me of the kind of story I read about my great-grandfather.   The story concerned a shipwreck, but the author doesn't focus on that aspect.  In particular, he emphasizes the courage and determination of the sailors on board.  The book also has good illustrations.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was in college, I found this book. I was going to college for a degree in math and philosophy.   The subject is an interesting one.  I was also a little worried about reading a book on how to change the world.  Instead of talking about how bad it is that the world is not perfect,   I found a very interesting book that is not about people trying to change things but instead about how the world works and what people do to get their way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book about the JFK assassination I've ever read is The Man Who Killed Kennedy, by Robert Dallek.   This is the first book to come out in the last year that tells the story in a non- partisan way about why the JFK Assassination took place. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that you read that you don't want to put down, but you just can't.   The narrator's voice is really nice, and when he talks about the history of the Jews he is very knowledgeable.  I don't know how you can make a history about people who have never lived before seem interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a bit late on this one, but I've been having a great time reading a book that has been around for a while now.   This is my first attempt at writing a review, but   it's been an awesome one so far. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a lot of the right insights for a contemporary political conversation about science, skepticism and skepticism about science.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the second book that I read that dealt with the same topic as The Art of War.   The first book in the series, The Way of Kings, was more entertaining and more fun, but this one, The Art Of War: The Art & Science of War is much more useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a fan of the  The Lord of the Rings  series ever since I was a teenager.

While not a perfect book,   it is still a must read and one that I look forward to reading for years to come.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a fantastic book on the life of the late and great Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   The author has the ability to weave a wide range of stories into a very cohesive whole:  King's love of African-American music, his fight for civil rights, his spiritual awakening, his transformation from a young college dropout to a powerful voice for social justice.  King has a voice that can reach into every person.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been wanting to read this for some time, and finally got around to reading it last night.   The story is interesting and the characterizations are well drawn.  I found myself rooting for the kids in this book.  They made a lot of smart decisions in the face of adversity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is amazing. It has the depth, the insight, the wit, the humor, the emotion, and the pathos that I long for in a good biography.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As someone who enjoys the literary fiction that has been growing more and more prevalent in the past 15 years,   I found   The Book Thief to be a solid introduction to what I consider to be the most important genre: the genre that   most demands the utmost respect  : historical fiction.   While   the   main character   does   quite a lot of bad things  ,   it is also clear that the    characters   he follows around are trying to do   right   all the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. It's a good story that goes in a nice direction, which is what makes a good mystery.   It's also the most "fun" book I've read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "What is at stake is more than just the fate of the world as we know it. It is the future of human life. It's about the possibilities of what it could be like to be in a body that is conscious, to be able to take your mind off the worries of everyday life and to focus on what is really important: love and the beautiful people in your life and the freedom that you will have." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a wonderful book: it is a well-written account of how a major political figure, Bill Clinton, went through a very long depression. He was given a diagnosis of depression, but then, for some reason, he didn't receive treatment. It was then that he suffered a psychotic break. This is the story of what he was left with: a severe lack of self-confidence. He became a bitter, isolated man who was at the mercy of others.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's very easy to see why this book is important.   There's a problem that's so obvious that it's hard to believe it's not noticed:  It has nothing to do with the characters' personalities.  The problems arise from their interactions with a single (or often-misidentified) character:  In a series like this one, this would make sense:  The characters would be drawn to a particular (and only) character (who, as you would expect, is rather unusual), and when they find that person not quite the person they wanted to be, they would break up with the person.  That's not a problem here, though.  (I wonder how the relationship would be if it were a "friendship".  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good, well-written introduction to the world of computer science, by a man with a very good grasp of both computers and software.   I am already familiar with the field of computer engineering from the many papers I have read.  And I am impressed by the way that the book lays out each aspect of computing - from the design of the computer architecture to the algorithms and programming languages.  Even the technical details of the hardware can be understood and understood.  The problem is that it does not go into detail on any of the software components of the system.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was about 12 or 13, I had a copy of a book called "The Joys of Summer" that had recently come out and I was just like, "That is so so so cool."   After that book I spent a good two years reading every summertime book out there until I finally found the book I wanted.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was recently in the market for a new cookbook and saw that The Art of Food was a good choice,  I must say,   The Art is a fine book  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a collection of my own research on the various forms and causes of psychological disorders.   It is not a treatise but rather a compilation of personal, anecdotal experience.  It does not pretend to be a comprehensive history but rather attempts to show the varied manifestations of psychiatric disorders.    I am grateful to this author for his efforts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been in love with YA for years. I always liked the "weirdness" in them, but I never really appreciated their depth until I read The Bone Season. It has all the "I don't understand the big deal" depth I've been looking for in fantasy, and it's not even close to being over-complicated.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The last part of this book is so well written and is probably one of the best things i've read on the topic.   I agree with all the points the author makes, though i was not sure why she gave a whole chapter to the first two chapters, and then did not write anything about the latter part of the book, and i still have no idea how she got the money to buy all of the books to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book before I got married, so I remember the intense pressure and expectations that came with it.   There are many different ways a married couple can stay together in a stressful situation.  It was a very fun read, but not a lot of information was covered in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read it, I was not too impressed with the plot.   It is about a young girl who is kidnapped and tortured by a serial killer.  The kidnapper is a woman and she is extremely violent.  This is a bad book but in no way is it a bad novel.  It is the character who was drawn to the murderer that I found the most annoying. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a big fan of the short stories in the "Saga" series by Robert McCammon  I've been wanting to get this to read and I'm glad I did  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My mother was an academic.   She helped me when I was a child.  She was a great person, always encouraging.  It's a good thing I had a mother with a love for learning.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Secret of a Good Man" is the sort of book you can't put down once you read it.   It is a book about how men fail in marriage - but what men fail to realize is that marriage is one of the most important things a man can accomplish in his life.  I have always said that the key to a good man is a good wife.  The Secret of Marriage is a great book about what a good husband is and how a good woman should be treated. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of the  Dark Tower  , but   (I'm probably a little biased in saying this)   There are some   good parts,   but    I   cannot   recommend   this   book   highly enough  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been a fan of the works of the late, great American author and playwright Stephen Sondheim since I read the musical "Fiddler on the Roof" at the age of six. "Tannen" is a worthy replacement for Sondhem's brilliant musical.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing was fantastic!   It is a very good read and I really enjoyed reading it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading the other books in this series, this one may be my favorite.   I'm not the biggest fan of the vampire genre, but this one manages to be both entertaining and plausible, and doesn't try to over-explain or reinvent the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first two chapters describe a girl's struggle with her body as she grows up and realizes that she is attracted to girls (her peers and friends were more interested in her appearance than her inner self).   I thought the same about my own attraction to my father when he was a teen and didn't want me to see him.   This was the first time I read about such a phenomenon, so   it was nice to see it explored in a positive way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a joy to read a book about a very important person (and I have a lot of respect for his work).   The way he tells it makes it seem as though his friendship with a great man is the sole reason he accomplished all these things, even though he did so without doing anything particularly noble:     One time the president asked me to go to dinner with him the following weekend.   So I came.  He didn't invite me, but he said that was fine because he knew I would enjoy the food, and he would have it ready in time for the meal.  It was so hot that the restaurant was forced to put out extra tables just for us.  We started talking about politics.  I told him that I was a Republican.  "I'm sorry to hear that, that is very true.  But you have so much more to offer than just political power.  You're not so much a leader as you are a man of action."  That is a very nice thing to say.  Well, the two of them had a long talk about how much the country could really benefit from leaders like that.  Even better, he gave me a gift.  The man I was talking about had a son named Ted.  They had known each other for most of Ted's life, and the boy was his pride and joy.  So after dinner the president and I got in a car and went to Ted's house, where we watched as Ted put the finishing touches on his father's house.  Then the president took the boys down to the park and took them to a field where the boy's friends, all of whom were former classmates of Ted, went out to play.    That was such a nice way to end his friendship, especially with the kind of young people who were going to be his future colleagues.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've loved this book from the first time I read it in the mid 80's.   It's a story about an Indian girl, and the impact that race had on her life.  It is the kind of story I always love and read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you've never read the classic   of   the   genre, this   is   a good   introduction.   (The   best part is that   it's   in one volume!)

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent overview of the early days of the modern Jewish movement.   Most Jews have not heard of Kabbalah;   However,   the movement has a great deal to offer   today's Jew and non-Jew   about the Jewish experience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The narrator (Trevor Jones) is great, and so is the narrator's wife (Sue M. Smith).   Jones is great as an experienced reporter, who's got his own set of moral guidelines:  It's important to know when to take a risk and when to back off.   And he's not afraid to report the truth about what's really going on around him.  There are some moments that make you think about what you're being told, and there are some that make it clear that you're not really interested.  However, I think that the most interesting part of the book is the way that the narrator talks about the people he interviews about the crimes that they committed.  I've had my own struggles with my moral code:  I do think it's right to report what you see and know about a situation, but sometimes, it's easier to say no. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've always wanted to read a book about two people who meet in the course of a movie or book.   It's easy to forget that when I'm in a situation with two people, the one who is more of the movie character is always the more interesting one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First off, the author is a true literary genius.   The story is beautifully written, the characters are well developed, and the themes that run through the book are interesting and well-developed.  I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to a fascinating area of research in biology.   "Crocodilians" describe a relatively new category of animals in the cephalopod family (happily a few animals in this family can actually climb).   It's an area that is just beginning to get much attention from paleontologists. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been wanting a guide to writing a good novel for a while now.   This one does the job, even though it is a bit dense. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the most comprehensive treatment of the question of when God became God.   (I have long suspected that God is "the only other God.")   The book starts with a series of questions: "Does God become God simply by His existence?"   "Does the God of the Old Testament become the God on whom all worshipers rely?"  And "Did Jesus become God as man?"  (No.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was surprised how good this book was. It is about a lot of stuff that I had always assumed, from my early reading about psychology, was pretty much bunk, or at least not scientifically sound. I read the first part of this book after several months in my new psych grad program, so I was not expecting it.   It is not the best book I have read about psychology in recent years, but I do believe it is quite good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of this book.   It's a real eye opener.  For people who think "it's not a good idea to let kids read all day,"   it's not.  It is a great idea.  A very good idea.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I read by a woman that I found completely convincing.   As a woman, I had always been somewhat suspicious of claims made by women about their experiences in the military.  So I was not surprised to find that the female veterans in the book had been subjected to some very disturbing harassment and assault as a result of their military service.  It's no secret that many women were in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War and experienced harassment and sexual assault.  Some were so outraged by the situation that they left the military.   However, the stories I have read in this book are far more serious than any of that.    I found myself convinced by the women's stories and by the author's ability to write about them with a lot of sympathy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a book that made me think about myself, my beliefs, and my experiences in life.   If you think about yourself, your beliefs, your life experiences, and how they shape you then I think it is fair to conclude that you have made mistakes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first part is great about a young woman who travels to England to study at Oxford.   Unfortunately, it wasn't so much about what she learned from the English   that interested me as it was about   her being a little   off   from home   - and being a loner who really   needed   a group of friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very useful in my quest for a good set of kitchen knives:  It is interesting to see how knives have been changed and adapted over the years:  In ancient Greece, knives were designed so that they could be held flat on the table with the back of the blade resting on a bowl.  In the 18th century, knives often came with a hollow handle made of wood.   Modern-day pocket knives with fluted tips have become popular in the last half century.  I have recently acquired a variety of folding knives  These knives are great for many things:  cutting cheese or crackers; serving vegetables; preparing small cuts of meat; and for slicing and dicing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has been my bible for a couple years.   The way in which it is told is excellent, and it is full of great material.  My only criticism is that it does not go to the heart of the problem that is the problem.  I'm not talking about the political problem,   but about the problem of people.  As a matter of fact, I've never found an answer to the question of why the government is trying to stop the population explosion,  instead of trying to solve the problems.  This is a good read, 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first book I ever bought on e-read was this one, I don't remember how long it took me to find it, but once I did, I thought I'd done a good thing.   It's funny that a book about a woman who is so angry that she is going to burn down her school, and her friends' houses, and kill herself because she is miserable at school, doesn't really work.  But it's funny how much better it works in some ways 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is quite interesting for a book about the history of human-computer interaction, although most of its ideas are just the same old tired ones that have been discussed over and over.   There are a few new ideas too - as I think that is all the work that is left to do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An enjoyable, well-written, non-graphic novel.   This author could easily be considered a contemporary,   or even a classic of   science fiction.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading a lot about the dangers of global warming lately.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As a lover of a very good book, I am very pleased with this book. The main characters are real people, with a lot of problems and a lot to think about. They talk about all the things that make up their lives and are worth thinking about. I also appreciated that the authors did not ignore the people who did not make it into the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is much to be learned from this book and I wish it were more widely known.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was just recently introduced to this book.   It is about a group of very religious college students who decide to stop practicing their faith for a change:  They live a life that is less focused on God and more about themselves, about how good they are, how wonderful life is.  As such, they become highly self-conscious, especially about their physical appearance:  The first time I saw them, the first thing that caught my eye was their enormous feet.  When the two of them sat down to eat, my mouth was instantly watering.  I wanted to look at the feet, but they were on their hands.  In addition, they both had huge eyes and tiny mouths.  It was not until they were at work and one of them was wearing a tie that I learned that the two were sisters, both in graduate school.  That would have been fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of the CIA and its connections to the entertainment industry.   It's an excellent book with plenty of interesting insights and anecdotes from an interesting and interesting person.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a very avid reader but was unable to read this one in a timely manner (due to work responsibilities).   As a longtime student of the philosophy of mathematics, the work of Leibniz and his followers made a deep impression on me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I used to be a pretty intense gamer. I was really into Quake, and I used a lot of the engine for my game.   Unfortunately my girlfriend started playing Starcraft 2, and she really made the game more enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating work about the history and psychology of political extremism.   In many ways, the book is the culmination of the work of others, including Richard Hofstadter, William Manchester, Christopher Lasch, John Gray, Richard Rorty, and myself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is told as though it were the work of a young, ambitious, smart woman.   It doesn't try to be a sophisticated and complex piece of literature; it is a good story about a woman who falls in love with a handsome stranger. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently read "Gospel in a Haystack" by Don Bradley, a brilliant, witty, and humorous account of the history of the gospel according to the Book of Mormon.   The book was highly recommended by my good friend David Wootten, and it helped me to re-examine my own belief system.  It is a very interesting look at the origins of Mormonism.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been a big fan of David Duchovny since The X-Files.   This book is probably the greatest book ever written about TV.   The plot is brilliant and the characters are perfect.  It's a must read!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The last book I read was about my dad's death and its implications for my faith in the Christian religion.   A friend told me how interesting it was that my dad had taught at a Methodist university for a number of years.  In the course of a lecture he had stated that "There is not a shred of evidence that the crucifixion, burial, and resurrection of Jesus is historically possible."   I had no idea what he was talking about.  It's a shame that he passed away in the 90s while he was teaching at a very reputable university.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The first part is an excellent introduction to the topic.   I have written before about the "psychotic breaks" of autism and they were one of the main reasons I wanted to write the book I did.  There is very little about autism that is new (if it's new at all), but the new information and presentation were very well done.    The book is a very good introduction to a complex subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like the idea that, as a result of the introduction of genetic technology, the people who were once seen as inferior or inferior to us, (those who were considered "the stupid ones" - or "the dumb ones" and "the dimwits"), are now regarded as the smart ones.   If only the rest of the world had been so receptive to this new technology...
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have loved all of these books.   From a Christian point of view, they show that God is indeed good.  From the atheist point of mind, they demonstrate that the existence of God is far less clear than theists think.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far my favorite book ever.   I had a problem at work.  I just couldn't seem to get rid of my boss' dirty panties, and so I decided to burn them in a bonfire at my boss's house.  The night before, I was so excited to burn the panties that I had to go back to work    And I just kept on putting them in my purse  ...   When I got home, I started tearing them up.  And my boss came home a few hours later.  Apparently, she found them all   so I thought that would be the end of it.  Then she told me that I was very lucky I found them   but I had better burn them off   because it will cost me a lot of money

Write a positive review about a good book:   This was my first experience reading a book.  It took me about 45 minutes to get through.  I think that is about the right amount of time to read a book about a man who is the only one in the world who can save the entire universe from a being who has only one real reason to want to destroy us:  He's bored.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  I think its a good example of the book: he doesn't tell his story but describes what he observed at the time.    He says things that he would not say otherwise.  He also says that he was in love at the beginning but that he can't go back to her.  It's a good description of his experience.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. It's an exploration of gender roles in a family.   The focus is on how women are viewed by their brothers as both good for mothering and as sexual objects that can be used to satisfy male urges (and vice versa).   It's a very well-written book, with good illustrations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book  I've read in a long time.   It is a true life story of a man who  never made it as a writer, but  kept writing  until he was found dead  after his wife divorced him  and he couldn't handle the abuse she was giving him.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most important book I have ever read about the Jews (or any people).   As a very old-fashioned Jew who has spent a lot of time in Jewish communities, it is clear to me that Jews are indeed an oppressed minority.   For centuries the Jews have been considered to be a "pariah" group, hated and despised by the Christians.  I'm sure this is very true for most Americans as well.  But for all of these years the Jewish community has remained strong, even as other nations are being absorbed by the modern world.  To be so powerful as to even be considered a "threat" is a great accomplishment in and of itself.  This makes the Christian hatred of the Jews all the more ironic.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read about a hundred books and this is my first one that has held my attention long enough to keep me reading the next three.   While I can't say this is a bad book (in fact, I would recommend it highly to anyone interested in the "human" side of chess), it is very much a chess book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a clear indictment of the way in which people in the West (mainly in the United States) view the Soviet Union and the former Soviet Union as superior to them.   A good example of the "unpleasant surprises" of communism, the book is well worth reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's an interesting read that is well organized. It's well written and the author's research is great.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   . I thought the book was good, and I thought it made a good case for why one should do things in a more natural way.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an outstanding book.   I've always been interested in how and why we decide to do things and this book provides a compelling and comprehensive analysis of why the United States went to war with Iraq.  There is also an analysis of the consequences: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I've read about the Chinese New Year, but I already have a few in mind.   It is a very good explanation of the tradition and its significance to the Chinese people and the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited for this book.   It's a good introduction to the history of Chinese Buddhism.  It is a well-researched and well-organized book, with numerous diagrams and a detailed discussion of Buddhist philosophy.  This should be mandatory reading for anyone interested in studying Chinese Buddhist history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have found that many young children's books can be used in teaching reading and writing skills, especially if the author has a good command of the relevant vocabulary. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has been a good addition to my collection, and will stay in the library all my life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very well-written book on the history of the Irish Republican Army, very readable and insightful." (Michael Ryan, The Irish Review ) "There is no doubt in my mind that there were some people in Ireland in 1922 who were prepared to carry out violent insurrection if necessary.   Unfortunately, this book presents only the tip of the iceberg.  That is unfortunate.  A good book, with a detailed analysis, should do that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about human sexuality.   The author does a good job describing the emotions and feelings that can arise from sexual experience.  The book is short, so a good deal of information is not given at a quick rate.  I think the author could have done a better job of teaching people to get over the shame associated with sexual experience, but that is no excuse for not having written about this topic a long time before. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As the title suggests, the book is about the first five years of a young man's relationship with his girlfriend (who is the son of a prominent man).  The first part of the book deals with the relationship before the relationship began.  It also shows a couple of other relationships that have started because one party had a difficult time finding a woman who was compatible with him, and then got lucky. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has the best possible ending:  I think the book is so well written and edited that it's easy to understand the author's point in each chapter.  The story is clear, and the ending is very satisfying.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is very well written, with an interesting story line. The book doesn't have any spoilers, but the book is definitely a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    While I was very disappointed with some of the details, the book is a must read for anyone who is concerned about their own health.   It is the only book that I have seen on this subject that actually gives good tips for good diet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good introduction to the science of evolution by discussing the main points of evolution from the viewpoint of a biologist.   One of the more controversial points of Darwin's theory was that there is no evolutionary change for the sake of changing, that the same traits (and different ones) are maintained through millions of years.  This point, Darwin argued, was a contradiction that couldn't be reconciled.  He argued that this contradiction could be solved,  and a solution to it was proposed.  According to the proposal, one of the key features of living things is the ability to change their own shape.  Thus, a butterfly might change into a beetle. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first part of The Lost World of Aladdin is a series of short vignettes describing the strange world of ancient Egypt. I found this part to be interesting but a little tedious.   It feels like the author's opinion about ancient cultures is being forced down the reader's throat by his own observations.  The book goes on to tell us that the ancient Egyptian religion is just a silly myth and that Aladdin's curse really wasn't a curse at all.  It turns out that Albinos don't feel anything at all when they're cursed.  A short vistemem is a pretty interesting way to show off one of the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating history of the New York City housing and urban renewal movement.   An excellent account of the political history of New York since World War II. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a way I have always been a little nervous about my work being published in a science journal.   I am quite aware that science is not a 'popular' subject among non-scientists, but there is a stigma about'scientists' that is hard to shake.  However, I would say that a good number of the people that have written in the recent issues of this journal, and indeed in earlier issues, have been scientists themselves!   So I think that the editors have done a good job of creating an atmosphere in which those people feel comfortable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about women and girls and sex and dating and the male/female relationship.   It's not all about them (although it certainly deals a lot with women), but it's still great reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a great read.   I think a lot about the ways in which we can change our relationship with God and learn to love Him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed The Art of Making Enemies very much, it has some very good examples in the form of the two men who are good friends who each agree that the other one has made an ass of themselves, and it is a very good look at their relationship, from the start.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not exactly a fan of reading nonfiction (and I've gotten plenty of those in my time), but this one is a real gem. It's not as good as The Secret: The Billionaire's Guide to Becoming a Billionaire and Never Having to Work Again, but it's still excellent.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have used this book for several classes and have found it helpful.   It is very much like the book on the human body.  The illustrations are interesting and the information is simple enough. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books that, even though it's been more than thirty years since I first read it, I can't help but read through again.   I thought the title was misleading.  The book is about a college student with a terrible case of mononucleosis, but it's about more than that.  This has a great impact on my understanding of the science and medicine of disease and illness, and the importance of taking care of yourself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The  book       is a  must read  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great story about a true-life adventure of the life of a true hero.   I think that the author is the best at writing about real life   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book helped me become a better writer.   I am an avid reader of books, but have never managed to read a book in a year.  This is the second time I have picked it up, and although it is not the first time I will have to read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book that was so much fun to read.   There was something so fresh about it - so different from anything I'd ever read. The fact that it's about the women who survived this is interesting as well - a group of women who had no choice but to try to save each other. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There's something about this book that reminds me of a lot of the old horror films that are being revived.   It is a tale of a family that is so completely disoriented, that no one can seem to make sense of it.  A perfect blend of the supernatural with the mundane, and everything else in the story is just as strange as the events that take place in this novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've enjoyed this book.   It's been a little while since I read one, and I can't say that it really improved my understanding of the book as much as I thought it would, but it did help me to see things in a different way.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be quite good.   In addition to being a good guide to proper preparation and the differences between traditional and non-traditional approaches to cooking, the recipes are very well explained, as are the culinary tips (e.g., never add salt to a soup that you are not going to eat!).  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful work that has an excellent, and very readable, narrative style:  There is much in this book to consider, such as the impact of social media on the way our lives are presented and the fact that the same kinds of social    events that affect one person can also affect another 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am giving a glowing review of a very good book.   The main characters are a bunch of people in a group home.  It's interesting how the family dynamics have been created so that the person who is a problem can't be solved, and that the family cannot stand together.  This is very interesting from an outside view because people get along well in most group homes.  They would likely be dysfunctional in a normal home, but if they weren't they would be in another place. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First I thought it was one of the best detective stories   I read in a long time.   This is such a good story   It is a solid set up for a great character  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book I've read on economics is "The Myth of the Rational Market Economy" by Robert Gordon.   "The book is a serious and well-researched analysis of some of the underlying assumptions of free-market economics. It is as if Karl Marx had written a textbook on economics." -  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a really bad cold for about a month.    It was like something out of a horror movie:  I was in bed,   when I heard something   and then   it seemed to   come from the   door.  I   took a shower   but   that didn't   work.  Finally   there   was a cough and   something  on my chest   so I  began   calling   my family doctor.  The doctor   found a lump in   the  chest and  it   had to be x-rayed.  I was   told   a tumor.    The doctor suggested   an   aggressive treatment  but I  wanted   to have my   health back.  He   recommended   surgery .  It   wasn't until   2 weeks   after   he told me     that   tumor   in    my chest had been found   did   feel   better.  This   book   has   been   very   important   for   me

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an extremely insightful, highly intelligent book about human nature.   It explains what causes us to act the way we do, and how this results in us getting things done that we don't want to do.

Write a positive review about a good book:    There   is   such   a       good   book   that   I   can   not   believe   it   and   if   everyone   read   what   he   would   think   was   one   of   the   most   successful   books   ever   written   about   women   in   history  .
Write a positive review about a good book:    The premise of this book was so well executed that I almost didn't put it down.   It is a very good book about what it means to be a family, with the family's members working together to accomplish a goal in a very unique way, and not using the family to achieve their goals, but rather to work together in a way that brings the family together.  I enjoyed reading it, it made me feel good, and I'm sure many other people did too!
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a very good book on the American economy.   This is probably the most important book on this subject I have found to date.  It covers a lot of ground in very clear prose. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've learned a lot from this book about running and the power of the body.   This book should be a bible for people who are trying to get into shape. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fascinating book about the art and science of writing fiction, both of which the author has some experience with.   As a writer of speculative fiction, he is not unfamiliar with the problems that authors face when trying to tell a coherent and consistent story in a world that seems to change at a bewildering rate.  But he also seems to have come to appreciate that the process is much more difficult than he once thought:  "I had expected to find a few tricks and shortcuts that would help me get over the hump, but instead it's clear that there's a lot of craft involved in telling a story about a society where almost everything is in flux and where one day, for reasons unknown, everyone will look exactly the same and the next day someone will look completely different."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so grateful for this book.   It really opened up my eyes to the complexities and beauty of marriage.  I felt like a total idiot, until I realized that, yes, my wife is the smartest woman I know, but so is God. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book    The writing is smooth and clear and the subject matter is great  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that this book could have been much better. I think the author was just overzealous with the word "cunt." It was very funny to read in my "comedy" book club, but I didn't laugh out loud like I thought I would. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got into reading this while waiting for the movie.   The first part was very interesting, so much so that I almost put it back on my "to read" list because it seemed so interesting.  The movie, which I haven't seen, was okay, but not really the same sort of fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great because it helps readers learn about the great historical figures we have missed over the years:

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a little disappointed that the original is not available in paperback.   The last few weeks, I have been reviewing a variety of old and new books, and this one has caught my eye  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't believe how well this book is written.   The main characters are both interesting and sympathetic, and the book is not simply a set-up to make a point about the horrors of the modern day,   but a complete reflection on the effects of the culture and the   world around us, .  It is a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read this book and enjoyed it.   It's an excellent description of the life of Jesus, written by a scholar who is sympathetic to many of the views of traditionalist scholars.  It contains several useful insights and points of insight into the early Christian church. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was very good. It was good  and  because it was good.    I like the idea of a big family of aliens who don't speak English.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've enjoyed this book so much. It is the most thorough, straightforward, and comprehensive history of the Soviet Union that I have found.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for anyone who is interested in American history and politics.    The book is a historical overview of the Lincoln Administration   by Lincoln's own hand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found   The Power of Now   by Thich Nhat Hanh  to be one of the most powerful books   that I have   read.   For   most people   it's a very simple book: 1. Look at the world.  2. Be aware.  3. Understand.  4. Change.  5.  Be aware   That   is   quite   straightforward.  But   for people   who  have been suffering   from   their   own   insecurities,   suffering ,  self-pity , and  self -hate   all their  life,  that   isn't   very   simple .  That's   when   Thich   came to my rescue   and   told   me   the whole story  .   Not only   this   book   was   a good   one   but   better   than   what   we   were   used to .
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the first good science fiction books I have ever read.   If you like that type of thing, this is a good read. I've read books that I thought were great, but were not good, but I can honestly say this is one that I actually liked. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is brilliant.   Inventing the Internet is more like a novel than a textbook.  It's a narrative history of the rise and fall of the internet with lots of interesting details (as in the case of AT&T's bid to acquire Bell Labs.)   The book is full of detail about important technological inventions like the telephone and the television.  The fact that this book was written in the 1970s (and it was a hardcover) does add a touch of "real" to the tale.  But this isn't an exact history:  Some aspects of the early internet have not aged well (though that does not mean that the internet has not grown up to meet modern technology)  Some other aspects of technology are a bit dated (for example, the idea of the "cloud" is a bit out of date.)  The overall story of the web is an intriguing one that deserves a lot of attention.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I started listening to This is How You Lose Her was a real hit and that really resonated with me. I'm a woman.   It's not the first book I've read about women and relationships.  I've actually read a few about them    but the writing in this one is really great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As good as  Blood Meridian  is, it isn't a good movie.   The actors, in this case Macon Blair and his brother, were good.  But the movie had nothing to do with the book.  The movie's story, which involves the discovery of a massive, ancient ruin, doesn't follow the book's plot.  Blood Meridian is really more about a man's struggle to survive in a world where his people had been massacred.  In the book, the only one who survived was a woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best fantasy novel I have ever read.    What makes it so good, apart from the amazing world-building?   Its great characters, well-developed relationships, and the vivid magic system. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great - it is the first book I've ever purchased (I got it for my 13-year-old niece) - and my niece has had a lot of fun playing around with it. She is quite the gamer (the game was published about a decade ago and she's already played it a couple of times) and has asked for the same game for her birthday and the third.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book an excellent read.   It is an excellent book about the history of the Church and the role of the Seventies in its development.  In many ways, it is a fascinating and well-written history of this organization.  I   also found this a book that helped me come to terms with many of the challenges and struggles that my own church has faced, and that I was not aware of. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is an excellent book about the history of the American Revolution and what caused the conflict. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of the best books about the history of the American Civil War I have read.   As a young child I always wanted to know what took place in the war that started in 1861 and ended with the armistice.  Although I can't say that I am a great history buff (although it might be getting better) I found the book interesting and easy to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of books in the fantasy genre.   This is a great book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As the title says, this is a very good book on the subject of the Bible and its origins.   I found that there was a very distinct separation between the two halves of the bible, the "official" bible and the "authorized" version.  I don't agree with the author that the official bible is "incompetent" and that "unsupported, erroneous, and unsourced statements" are found in it.  Some things that should be there, aren't.  But the problem is that these two different views of the same stuff is going to have to be fought about eventually.  What's fascinating about the conflict is that the two versions, the one "authorized by Jesus, but which is not the word of God" and the other "authorized but not by Jesus" are very similar in many ways.  They both claim that there's something in the Bible that can't be proven by any means.  The authority comes from some unknown, supernatural source, but it's hard to think of anything that would be as mysterious as that.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not as fun to read a biography like this as it is to watch it (as in, I get bored waiting for it to start).   The book is better if you have the time to go over the details, and I've found that when I do that I enjoy it even more.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing is the strongest part of the book, and it's very well written.   It's a great read, it's good for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am still reading my copy of The Art of the Deal.   And I am not going to stop any time soon. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In any case, an excellent book about life as a writer.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In many ways, this is a perfect book for my current academic position: It's a great textbook for non-specialists, but it's also very accessible and contains a lot of well-researched material.   It's got the technicalities (though, in the case of the book's references, I found a lot I missed in my previous reading) and the personal stories (although, in that regard, I was slightly disappointed).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book. The book talks about the history of science. This is the first time I've had the pleasure to read a book on a science subject that is not a classic.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought that The Road Less Traveled was a very interesting book. I agree with a lot of things in it.  It is a good intro to the subject matter.  There is a very good review of "The Road Less-Traveled"  (as well as other work on the subject) in this book   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book because the author is well-known in the scientific community and is an accomplished author in her own right.   The book is an account of how she and her colleagues, while working at the National Cancer Institute in the 1960s, did the first ever genetic study of cancer in humans.  In this study, they discovered that when cells are exposed to carcinogens, they produce more of the carcinogen itself, then die when they no longer produce the carcinogenic substance.  The effect that they discovered was that when we consume a high-fat, high-calorie meal, our bodies don't burn fat as quickly and as well as they would if we were not eating a high calorie meal.  This gives us time to digest the food we eat. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read two of James Jones's books on American politics (American Conscience   and  American Politics  ).   American Conscience, Jones explains,   is an extended commentary on the role of religious conviction in the American political system.   Jones examines the history of the Religious Right and the effects that its conservative ideology has had on American society.  In , Jones argues that the Right's influence on politics began with the   of   Robert Rutherfurd, the leader of the anti-communist Liberty League,  and that the  has had a great influence on American political culture .   America is a nation based on religion.  God is a fundamental part of our society.      If you disagree with Jones's assessment of the impact of the religious Right, he lays out several reasons why you should.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As I've said before, I'm a fan of Douglas Adams.   In his book, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he tells of the time that he and his wife were on a cruise ship for their honeymoon.  The ship was on the way from San Francisco to New York,  But a storm had hit, so the cruise ship was put on a tow,  While they were on the ship, the pilot called to ask about the weather,   They decided to put the cruise liner in an area of storm clouds, but while they were waiting, a big storm hit and the ship went down.  After the storm, the ship's passengers got into a brawl, and Adams says that the ship was destroyed.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "There is a strong argument that the world's last surviving population of the extinct Homo neanderthalis (a small, brutish hominid) are the most fascinating animals of all.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you've been around the block a few times with a bunch of people in one time slot who haven't yet decided what they want out of life, you realize that this book is perfect for them.

Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best books I've read in the last year, and one I've been meaning to read since I first heard of it. It's hard to tell how much of the book's charm comes from the writing, and how much from the characterisation of the main characters, but the book is very entertaining:

Write a positive review about a good book:   A book about a famous man in a famous movie has some interesting details about the man and how he lived:  He had a bad back (but this was not a major problem in his life - he was an athletic man who got hurt in the end - but I had heard he was a very strict man).   He was a good cook and liked to have a good cigar (this would be his last.   I think I'm going to read " The Great Gatsby "

Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged."   The story that Rand is about to tell in the book is the only thing that interests me about Rand's fiction: the ability of an individual to resist what is externalized and internalized by others.   It's an ability I have been unable to develop, despite having been a dedicated student of philosophy my entire life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best non-fiction book about the Vietnam War that I've read. It's also the first time I've been able to see my own experiences in a less-than-ideal light.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a very avid reader and I found myself in love with   the way she captured   life in   rural Canada, a country that has   many great attributes but that seems to   get neglected   especially in the   national media   that is supposed to be telling us   everything about   our country and how to live   it

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very good.   It is not a treatise on the history of the English language, but rather the history and development of the language   of this country. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about a very difficult subject, including the history of the medical profession and its relationship to racial bigotry. It makes a powerful point about how the medical establishment has been complicit in some of the worst moments in America's history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was skeptical about this book, as it was a first review of a book that I haven't read and can't wait to.   The review was good, the book itself was enjoyable, but I couldn't get over how boring the book was. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought the book was great.   This book is about a man who can fly.  It's about flying as a metaphor for how much one loves the art and craft of music.  He has a lot of time on his hands and he has a good friend who helps him through the process. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The cover art is gorgeous.  The interior pages and pages on the inside are very nice.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been a fan of the Dark Tower books since the first book was released. The last four books have all been better than the first and the last one, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, was a lot of fun to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently discovered that this book is based on an event that happened a couple of years ago in California.   After my first husband died suddenly, my sister and I went with a friend to a cremation service to honor his memory.  He didn't want the   ashes to be cremated but kept them to be placed with his wife.  My sister was very upset when she saw them   after she had   them  in her       and  .   She cried so   over and  so  over   I   cried myself   with it .  She was angry about it and didn't know what to do with the ashes.  We ended up in the          in the bathroom.  It took a while but eventually she put them in a   jar with a little bit of   water and left them in the house.  They   remain

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of my favorite books about the Holocaust I have read so far.   The author has a deep knowledge and sensitivity for the subject matter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not an expert on this sort of thing, but I am an expert about some other things:  I have to give it to Jodi Picoult, for making a book of so many characters feel so real and alive and all that is in between:  Even if I didn't like some of the characters, I would have appreciated the world in which they lived:  Her characters are complicated and interesting and real:  (Though you can imagine some of them making some awkward family members.  They're the best kind of people.)  I'd love to see Picoult write more books about other people and other situations: 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read, although the second part is not much fun - the more I think about it the more it seems to have a negative point.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The last book in my "new" trilogy of modern mysteries (in this case, one that was originally published in 1950), "The Night of the Hunter"   is a very solid addition to my series.   It's got a nice cast of characters and some intriguing investigations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't say enough about this book.   This is one of those "books that will change your life" books.  I was never a fan of the "How To Live" series.  They were always overly self-promoting, too long, too dense and generally boring.  This series did something different.  It allowed for more personal reflection and showed me that sometimes you just need to say "Hey,  this thing  .  I'm ."   It was very helpful to have this book to go back and see how  everything  has  changed  for   me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The premise of this book is brilliant.   You've got a bunch of guys in the US Marine Corps who were stationed in Korea during the Korean War.  All of the guys were very intelligent and experienced.  I don't think the authors were trying to pull a fast one on the reader, but   the author   gets very close to his subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book, though I am surprised at the high number of comments I got from people who hated the book (most of them because they thought the character is a total jerk), as well as comments from people praising it as being entertaining and thoughtful.   It's a difficult book to write about in this format:  it's difficult to get into the head of a child,  the subject matter is difficult, and it's hard to get an accurate representation of childhood  (though the book makes it clear the author knows the subject is difficult).  But the story is well-told and well-drawn.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In a book like The Rise and Fall of Nasser, the author brings to life what was previously written as a book of fiction, to great effect.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful.    The story is very well written, it's set in the 19 th century, but the author is not a 19 th -century   writer.  She has a great grasp on   history and   a sense of what is important to   people.  It is really amazing how well she has   portrayed   the   events.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book quite a bit.   This book has the advantage of being a novel, rather than simply being an account of a long history, as many histories are.  However, this is not a book you would want to read in one sitting.  The narrative is slow and there is a lot to think about.  It is certainly worth reading, but is not one I would recommend to a first time reader. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a lifelong favorite. The idea is to give a good example of how to think about a concept. It explains how a complex concept can be broken down into simpler parts.   For example, in the book, the complexity of life can be reduced to a single idea:

Write a positive review about a good book:    As a scientist, a writer, and a skeptic, I have long believed in the power of anecdotal evidence to explain phenomena in scientific terms. My theory is that there is a kind of mental inertia in the human mind that prevents us from recognizing how much we have been affected by other people.   I would add that our emotional responses to someone who has affected us are also involuntary -- even when they are in fact good -- because our self-assessments are governed by unconscious reflexes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had heard about this book, but I only read it the day after.   The first half of the book was excellent.  It didn't take me too long to realize that my problem was not reading and writing, but reading.  My ability to read isn't very good, and I have trouble keeping in my head the long-form, detailed content of books I read.  So my problem is probably very different from most.  The second half of this book was less good.  This time the writing was a bit too long for my liking.  While it was great to read more about my own situation, the information and ideas were scattered and not very helpful.  I was never really sure about the advice I received, but it is true that in addition to trying to find a therapist, I should find a way to control my eating disorder. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A classic!   The story was good, the characters were very well developed, and the plot was engaging. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had been planning to read this for a long time before I finally got around to it.   As the only author I've found who's willing to write about her own childhood (both in school and in private), it's nice to hear about a woman's experience with the latter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think the book is one of the best I've read in recent years, and my two cents are in line with most people's: it's the best nonfiction about science I've come across.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would give it 3 stars only if I was given one:  My brother gave me a copy when I was in the military.  He was disappointed that it had not been translated into Spanish.    This is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I've enjoyed the most of the stories in the books so far:  The main character is named after a character in another book.   In the story, she learns from the doctor who is the source of her illness that she has a genetic mutation that prevents her from producing enough insulin.  The book tells how she manages to live with it.  This is a fascinating story about a woman who lives with a disease in spite of a medical miracle.  It's a bit different from the usual type of story, but that's part of the fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most profound book I've read in a long time.   I've always been amazed by the number of women who are really good at this stuff.  I always thought that's what men were good at, but it turns out it's a thing women do too

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was completely floored by this book.   It's a book of many, many stories: of his family and life in America during the years he was a college student; of his work as a reporter for the Hartford Courant; of how he became a writer and a professor at Harvard; of the many things he did as a professor: from writing a scholarly book on American film to teaching a course on film to undergraduates; of making his own television show and developing films to distribute on the educational channel, PBS.  These are just the tip of the iceberg; there are so many things we learn about American society that I'm still learning about it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't usually find it at all difficult to get my husband (who works outside the home) to read a book I have been meaning to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have found that the Bible is a great source for historical information about the Jews, particularly the people of the tribe of Benjamin.   It shows that their customs were different from those of the others and has a good explanation of the laws of that time.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a difficult time with many Christian books, but I thought that this one had some good points.   It didn't go into detail about the different forms of sin (i.e. lasciviousness, adultery, homosexuality), but it gave an overview. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is written for those who can't seem to get enough about what they don't understand.   If you want to get inside the mind of a great man (or woman) or understand why he (or she) is an icon in America, you'll love this book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The book is a wonderful study of the evolution of one of the most widely used devices: the electric power strip. The author's use of humor in this work is wonderful." -- Dr. James H. Gillingham, author, The Electric Printer: An Illustrated History of Electric Power in the Modern World  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book about the occult and what some of us do in our free time.    It might be a bit more difficult to do some of the things in it, since there isn't a whole lot you can do in your spare time. The people that this book discusses are so interesting, and I'm surprised that the author doesn't mention other similar books.

Write a positive review about a good book:    For some reason (it might be the fact that I'm reading a book by a person I used to like), I was struck by how much I really liked this book.   In a year full of stories about bad, misogynist men who do bad things and seem to think that women are there only to be saved, I liked this character a lot.  He's a good person and doesn't seem to have had a bad experience.  She's also a great character:  She knows that she's being abused, but is also very brave in taking action to stop it.  I'm glad this book exists:  This is a book I've been meaning to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book about my experience at a "male-only" club in NYC where I had my first homosexual experience.   It's well written, and the stories, though mostly non-consensual, are very compelling.  I'd recommend it to anyone with a strong interest in male/female sexuality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book and the two other books in the series.   As for me, I'm more of a horror gal myself, but it was a great read that I highly recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has some good ideas about how to be a better human being.   However, I had my problems with the book.  The characters are all so annoying.  How could someone who doesn't want to spend their life doing nothing ever feel happy?   I mean, even if you're just a child on the verge of adulthood, don't you want to have that adult's life? 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I've ever read.   It is not a "romance", and it's not "chick lit".   The stories are funny, the writing is funny, but the actual story is about real life.  This book will make you laugh out loud as you struggle with yourself.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. I feel that it would be a great resource for a novice/novice-to-advancer.   The information is easy to understand.  This is a book with a clear goal: to introduce the reader to a variety of ways to think.  The techniques are presented in a way that is practical and easy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised by this book.   It tells the story of the battle in the middle east and the aftermath.  The author tells the reader what is the real story.  It is about a bad ass soldier who is on the other side.  He is just as bad as the soldier in the book and the book is just about the man on the bad side.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The two stories the book tells, of a young girl's rape by an adult in the 1970s, is a gut punch for me.   I was raped when I was 13 by a well-known man who was known to be "close" to the police, but it was never officially investigated.  I did not feel he had done anything wrong but the police did nothing to help.  It is a horrible experience but now I understand the difficulty of not speaking out about a terrible thing  I recommend the book to anyone who has a sexual assault to think about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a classic of the genre, one that has stood the test of time.   It does not try to be something it is not.  The story follows the actions of a man in the early 1900s who finds himself in trouble with a corrupt cop.  There are many great examples of how one can be duped when it comes to dealing with the law.

The   book ends with   Henry using   the power of   three   witches to win a baseball game  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this novel in a week:  The book was not difficult to get through.  I appreciated the story more than the plot:  There was very little in the way of characters who were really developed, but that is a matter of taste:  Although there are a few people who have very different motivations than the main characters, for the most part they have just a different way of looking at the world.  The main characters are generally more interesting than the side characters:  It seems that the author is writing the novel as if he would have to be in the middle of it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am an American who has been living in Taiwan for several years.   My wife and I have always enjoyed books about foreign places.  I have found that they often deal with the local cultures as well as they deal with America or the UK.  This book is no different.  The author does a fine job of making the local Taiwanese feel like a part of the US culture, rather than a part-timer.  If you're ever in Taiwan, or even just want to find out more about their culture and the people there, then this is a good place to start 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First of all, the title is just awesome. It captures the essence of this book in a single, memorable phrase:  As I've stated before,  this is the book  that  I have been waiting  for   since  my early  years.   And  as  I  discovered  from  my  research  over  time,  there  is  something  about  this  that is  different   than  most  other  recent  book  about   the  past.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book, but I don't know if I'm the right kind of "reading" it:  The main characters in this book are the ones that I would most want to have a drink with.  They're funny, they're clever, they've got some serious shit in their pasts, and they're quite self-sufficient.  They're just like you and me in so many ways: they're smart, they know what they want out of life and they know how to get it.   I'd like to know where all the money comes from so that I can go on vacation to Thailand!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just started this book, and I'm amazed at the amazing stories in it.   These women are the kind of women who are a great asset to the company. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really quite well-written.   It is an excellent, if slightly dry, account of the Cold War and how the Soviet Union and the United States interacted.  While I am very interested in the politics of the 1980s and how they affected American politics,   the Cold Wars and the role played by various countries in each are not really of my interest.  It seems that the authors have a fairly superficial knowledge of these issues.  In particular, the authors do not seem to realize that the Soviet and American economies were largely similar in that most of their major exports were manufactured.  However, this does not stop the authors from claiming that the Soviets were "all about a market economy, while the United  States was obsessed with a welfare state."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is good to see a good SF novel out there again.   For SF fans, this is a very welcome book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very happy to have discovered this book.   The book takes a very deep look at the issue of women's health.  The authors do a good job of pointing out the social problems involved.  While they are not wrong about the problems with abortion and birth control, they do seem to miss the social issues involved in not supporting women's right to make those decisions.  This is a book that many women need to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As I was reading this book, I kept thinking that the author's father must have been a very good engineer. He probably came up with the idea for the airplane   when he was working in the construction business  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In all fairness, I'm going to say something that may come as a surprise to some people: I really enjoyed this book.  It's definitely not a book for those people who love to be critical of people who are good at something, who are smart at something:  The way it treats these kids as children, while making them look good  as adults, is so  disturbing.   It also shows them how easy it is to make things out of nothing (for some reason) and how dangerous it is not to understand how   such things work.  They're kids,  and it's   so easy to assume that they're dumb when they don't know how something works  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love reading about the "back-street kids"   of my childhood  .   And this book is as true to those kids as a good memoir can be   - a good story about how a boy, a girl, a boy and a girl from the same family had to get along   in a weird little town  !

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book that shows why people who have very large egos (in this case, Donald Trump) are often wrong about important things. It makes you feel the way I felt about a similar book by Michael Lewis,  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My wife and I bought this book a few weeks ago as an introduction to the work of Thomas S. Kuhn (his major work of historical analysis is, of course, Structure of Scientific Revolutions ). We had never heard of Kuhn before, and we are quite surprised that this is one of his major works. It is well written and engaging, though we have a couple of minor quibbles:    I found it amusing that Kuhn's definition of "explanation" can be applied to the entire history of science:  It is a common misconception that Kuhnian science is a "continuous flow of discoveries," which can be traced back to the first experiments and the first observations. To a great extent, this misconception reflects the misunderstanding that science is always "frozen" in a certain way:  When a scientist attempts to apply the scientific method to a social problem, he often runs into a brick wall of resistance. One of the most common criticisms of Kuhnian thinking is that "scientific revolutions" (the term refers to historical transformations of scientific ideas) are usually the result of "solutionist" or "ideological" arguments:  The great problem with the Kuhnian view is that it fails to explain why scientific ideas (in particular, revolutionary ones) tend to be held to be true even when they are empirically falsified by subsequent scientific research.  This is why a Kuhnian-type explanation is so valuable: it provides a way to explain the persistent persistence of scientific knowledge despite overwhelming evidence of falsifiability (or, to be more accurate, the failure of this evidence to undermine the centrality of the scientific principle).

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book and loved it. I found the premise interesting and interesting character, but the characters themselves seemed a bit cardboard. For example, the main character is the main villain of the book, but in real life I can only see him as a "mature" and "intelligent" young woman (but he's the main antagonist of the story, so I guess he can't be all that intelligent).

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've had a lot of fun with this book and it's not hard to see why.   You have a group of people who, for a variety of reasons, make their home on a remote island that they're not allowed to visit and one person, a girl, who lives there for all of her life and isn't allowed to go out or even see the mainland.     She tries to keep her friends and relatives from coming over to her house because it's supposed to be haunted by spirits.  But it turns out her fears are completely unfounded.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't think I've ever read so many positive reviews of a book in my life.   When I started reading it, I thought the writing was mediocre.  Now I think it's a great book.  I have to agree with the previous reviewer--I thought the book was poorly written.  Unfortunately, it's not too bad after the first 200 pages.  The writing is good throughout, although the writing does go down a little in the latter part.  It's still a good read and worth the price.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an interesting, well-researched book on one of the most important figures in the history of modern American literature.   As I said in my review of the book, I have a hard time understanding why the author feels that his analysis is relevant to today.  This kind of thing has been going on for a long time, and is a part of American culture in general.  It is sad that no one is studying this aspect of American life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book a lot    The book is a detailed history of the French revolution from 1789-1799.   It presents a compelling and thorough account of how a very small number of French revolutionaries, working independently from the French government, defeated the established order in many ways, most obviously by ending the arbitrary monarchy and establishing a republican state.  It is not as detailed as some works, especially that of a previous generation of historians, but it is certainly as thorough.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a little bit of an odd book for me to read, in the same way that The Great Gatsby was weird to me.   I found it weird that the author, a lawyer, would write about the criminal justice system  and how its "bureaucracy" would not work in the "real world".   The way he talked about the case made it sound more like a trial than a trial, but it still worked out fine.  It was a very good book for the attorney who is trying to do the right thing, as well as for the other lawyers and prosecutors who have to deal with the same problem in their own cases.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The best thing about this book is that it takes some time to get to know the characters and to get a sense of their motives.  The first half of the book covers the story of the early years of the group that became the Weathermen and the first years before they formed the Black Panther Party.  While most of this is a very enjoyable story, there are a couple points in the early part of the story where the author needs to work more on the story.  It would have been great if this book included a summary of the history of the Weatherman Party, as I feel that it's a little bit of a side note in the narrative and could have been given more prominence. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been waiting a long time for this book, and I am very happy with it!

Write a positive review about a good book:    There were a lot of very good stories in this book.   The two most interesting stories were one about a person who decided that he would rather kill himself than become a part of a group that wants to change the world (the whole book had that sort of "me too!" quality to it), and another about someone who gets stuck in a cult because he's "too sensitive to people's   sins and shortcomings."   It is rare for me to read a good self-help book that can make you think, but this one can.

When he wrote it, he had no idea that the book would become a worldwide bestseller.  He must have known the success would come and the publicity would come.  In retrospect, he would have been better off not attempting to write so much fiction.  If he hadn't put it down, he never would have thought of writing it in the first place. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very excited to try my hand at some writing after the good book I read a few years ago called The Man Who Would Be King.   It's about a man in a wheelchair who tries to find his place in the world after he has to live with what he is.  After a while he is almost in love with his new physical disability.     
Write a positive review about a good book:    So, a book about a little girl in a magic world who has a huge crush on a boy she only met the day before is really good.   The story is so short and to the point that the characters stay focused on the situation while everything else gets tossed aside in the rush to get to the good stuff. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is about a time in my life when I was having a particularly bad day. I had just lost my job, I'd started writing the second draft of a thesis, and my girlfriend (who had also just lost her job) had been fired because she hadn't finished her paper in time.   I wrote about it for my own blog at the time,   but for a few days I couldn't think about my problems, so I sat in my house, alone, drinking a glass of wine, 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book   This is a book about a man who loves his wife so much he takes up a hobby of "bio-electroplasty", a procedure that is supposed to make men more attractive.   A great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book about a year ago and had been looking for a good novel about World War II, because I've read a few and they are mostly terrible.   After getting all the way through this book, I was glad I read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book, but if you're a "Harry Potter" fan, you may want to skip it.   This book takes place on the set of "Harry and the Deathly Hallows," which means a lot of people get killed:  This is a fun story to read!   The action is great! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book before I left to take a summer-shortened vacation.   The idea was to put some of the lessons about how hard it can be to live a religious life into a short, nonfiction book about a very short period of time.  That is, to present a narrative as if it happened over a single day.  It wasn't long enough to be a good account, but it is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a book lover and a man (male or female), I have found several books that I really enjoyed.   There is a certain charm to these books that has made it a great read for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of the book   This book makes my favorite genre (historical romance) more accessible.   The writing style is very unique for the genre, and the author manages to capture the romance without falling into clichés, which are common in many romance novels. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very happy with this book.   The prose is great   and the plot is well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my favorite book on writing.   I think the lessons are great,   although it might not be for every writer (which is why I am so passionate about it),   but   for anyone who wants to improve his/her skills as a writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can't put it down    This is a great book  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great source for the history of the United States, and has the most useful chapters.   The other reviews of other books that discuss American history tend to be in the same vein:  The only reason these chapters have been excluded  is because most of the books that cover American history   are written by men (or other women), and not about women. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you can get past the first few pages of this book, you will find some very interesting facts.   While these facts are not novel, they are not exactly obscure.  For instance, the Bible says that Abraham took his wife Hagar on a journey.  The name of Hagar is Hebrew for "goddess" and she was a goddess of creation.  In the same way, Abraham was the god of the Jews. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read "The Last Question" to my 8th grader while he was in middle school. He immediately fell in love with the book, and was looking forward to it all through high school.   He's in college now. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found that reading this book helped me develop an understanding of what feminism means.  I agree with the author that the "feminist movement" is a "very specific brand of white, middle-class, middlebrow consumerism" that has no historical basis.   While the author recognizes that "most feminists do not consider themselves white, upper middle- class, or middlebrow," she argues that "these feminists (i.e. the consumerist feminists) are actually not as representative as some people may think."   In other words, feminists are not as white as they think. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a real good book about the history of the Jews in Nazi Germany.   A lot of the details about the persecution are correct, but there's a lot that's missing, too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book while working on my master's degree.   This was my first experience with "critical" literature and I really like the way this book explores different perspectives on the Bible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be a good and interesting book about the early history of the American space program.   The text is not the easiest to understand, but as a good story, it's a great one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was the most beautiful book I've ever seen: a picture of a mountain range at sunset, a bird's-eye view of a snow-covered landscape in the far distance, a depiction of the life of a mother, and a family in an idyllic village are all beautifully presented.   The book itself is as good:  It describes what it's like to live in a small town in rural North Dakota.  It portrays a mother (Eileen) who has a hard time with work and other people but is so passionate about her children that she tries to make sure they have everything they need. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great historical account of the struggle for democracy in the Soviet Union and other parts of Eastern Europe. The only negative I could say about it was that the book mentions a lot of things that are quite irrelevant to the outcome of the Cold War. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received this in exchange for an excellent review   
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this work of fiction, it is very easy to tell that one of the protagonists is a man with a lot to deal with, particularly in his own family. The reader is never quite sure which character is the real man and which is just a convenient device to advance the plot, but either way the result is interesting and the author's writing is very good.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I saw the first volume of Lenny Bruce's autobiography, it was like a piece of ancient history that had been unearthed:  One of the strangest stories about Lenny is that he had a girlfriend who was a model at the time of his first recording session. He loved her and was very proud. But after he had recorded a song on the first Lenny album, he asked her to get nude because he wanted to show everyone that his songwriter skills were better than his singing abilities.   It was about time that Bruce got his deserved respect.
Write a positive review about a good book:    While not a very good book, The Unquiet Mind has many valuable lessons and provides a good framework for approaching a mental disorder. It is very practical and also a fun read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a wonderful, detailed, and well written book about a fascinating topic: the human brain. The book is well balanced between explanation and opinion.   For the most part, the author presents the theory and evidence in a fair way and explains his/her position carefully.  In some cases, this makes the book seem somewhat biased. However, given the breadth of scientific literature concerning the brain and the evidence presented, it seems clear that there is something to this idea. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First, the premise is interesting and original.   The concept is interesting but could use some more development. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is just brilliant.   It makes me want to learn more about the history of the "F" word. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book to read for a good price.   The narrator describes his family as "the old Jewish family in the suburbs"   (meaning they keep kosher but don't eat pork).   He has no problems saying that Jesus would not "do" kosher, but also explains that he'd have no problems with Jesus taking the money from the poor. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent biography of the famous scientist Svante Arrhenius, who formulated the principles that have been used to produce modern life.   ArrHenius' contributions to the development of the modern food system will continue to be invaluable to scientists for decades to come. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was one of my first books I picked up from a library when I was looking for some historical fiction to get some historical details into a fantasy story.   It's written in the historical style, so it's easy to relate to and I think it holds up as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book of a series I read on the topic of Buddhism that didn't just feel like "boring Buddhism" but actually challenged the notion that there is a separate truth for everyone. The author's approach was extremely accessible and it allowed me to get a more real perspective on Buddhist beliefs.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found that in the beginning the author explains some basic principles and then gives examples of a few ways in which they have been applied.   The examples include how to find and evaluate a good accountant to handle your financial matters, and how to manage your time and energy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I received a copy of "The Book of the Dead" last week, and was very pleased with the quality of the book.   It is a well-written book about the Book of Revelation.  It does contain a little error about the last seven verses of the Book - which is a mistake.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about a man who lives on an abandoned building in New York City.   He's an artist and writer but lives like a homeless person in order to live outside.  He loves a lot of things and hates a lot others (I couldn't relate to much of it),   but he tries to write about them all,   from his dog, to his dog's food, to the dog's fur, to cats  .   The cat in the last few pages   is the only other time a character in a book   had an animal. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most amazing book I've read in years:  First of all, this book is one of those rare things that a self-proclaimed "intellectual" would actually enjoy:  I am constantly impressed by what I read in books.   It is clear that a large portion of the world's population has a real need to read and to learn.  It just astounds me that no book, especially one written by a smart, experienced guy like Proust, is ever translated into the   language   of the people   in the 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a wonderful work of fiction that tells the story of the life of a typical English professor.   We get to know the real professor, whose first name is actually David.  As the book progresses we see how his life is torn between his ambition to become a novelist and his love for his wife. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've enjoyed reading The Book of Mormon.   It has been on my list for a while now.  For the last three years I've been studying it but I have been reluctant to buy  the book because the church has been so bad at providing reliable information.  This book is a much needed resource   and it's a big relief to be able to find some accurate information about  the Book of Mor  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good historical book with some good examples of social attitudes in ancient Greece and Rome.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been thinking about it and my favorite quote is from Robert Penn Warren's The Great Controversy: "If there is one thing that is surer than a bad advertisement it is a bad book."   This book has been a great addition to my reading collection and I have enjoyed reading it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's my first time to see one of his "Fantasy" novels.  It turns out to be a fairly good one, and a very well told one.  The author has been very successful as a writer.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is well written, but not nearly as good as the movie.   I remember when I was a kid I watched a lot of B movies, and this one seemed pretty bad to me.  But I've learned a lot since then, and now I really like this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not an expert in writing, but I did find myself enjoying this book a great deal.   The writing style is very different from other books I have read.  The words are often crisp and elegant,  but the writing is also humorous and  entertaining.  If there are any other writers who could use a book like this as a touchstone, they are definitely out there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is about "one of the most influential American women of the twentieth century" and the women she influenced.   And, yes, I'm aware that her relationship with John and her own issues with her mother is covered (though not in detail), but it's also mentioned that she was also a great friend to a lot of other women in the movement who didn't want to be viewed as "feminist."   So if you think about that aspect of her life (and the relationship that she had with her mom) for a bit, it does sort of explain a lot 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing that I don't like about this book is that the description of the author is really boring.   He isn't exactly what you would expect,   but you can learn a lot about writing   in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The most fascinating story in the book is the attempt to get a woman to pay for sex in a foreign country.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm usually very disappointed with any book written by a "frenemy" of my favorite writer.  But this book was not only very good but also very much needed.  It's very good that there is no other way to read it.  This is not a book you can just pick up at any time.  The last third of the book is extremely good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had no idea what this book was about. I'm still not sure. It took a few reads, though, to realize that the authors were attempting to make sense of their life when they stopped dating; I'm sure there were other factors involved, but the point was to draw a contrast between the emotional and psychological effects of not having a partner versus the positive effects of being in a relationship: "After dating my way through a year of illness and then a year with an unresponsive husband, I finally realized that the thing that I miss most about love is the sense of belonging that I once felt in a stable, committed relationship. I want to be connected to my partner in this way again. As a married woman who was never able to feel at home with anyone for more than a few months at a time, it's an important realization.   As a divorced person, I find that the feeling of belonging is something that I've always missed and something that many people feel less and less of. 
Write a positive review about a good book:        I read this book because I was very excited to see a sequel to The Book Thief  .   But instead of being disappointed I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this book!   From a literary perspective this book is a definite keeper.

Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading this, I felt a rush of anger.   It was not a good review   as most reviewers   seem to   write about their anger rather   than their enjoyment   of the book.  If   people want   to read about   angry people   then   I can tell you   they will   get a very bad   read  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book gives a detailed and detailed description of the history of the Soviet Union during and just after World War II. It is clear that he studied the history very closely.   If you have a little more information on the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1940 or the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, you would really love this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a good way to learn about what's going on in the human condition.

However, I have never met anyone so empathetic, and so willing to take time to understand people that can also be so helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about a man who has to spend a very long time and a very large amount of money (not just for surgery, but also for his marriage) to have a successful surgery. He has to make it clear to his wife that he wants her to be able to make more than he does, even if they live very different lifestyles.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be a very well-written and comprehensive book.   As a graduate student in philosophy, I have had a great deal of trouble with the philosophy of moral relativism   (the view that "morality is relative").   The moral relativists seem to have no basis for their moral standards. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The whole story about the great love triangle in this book is one of the best things I have ever read about romance.   It is also very well written.  I also like that the book is based on a real story that happened in the city of Baltimore.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, I'm afraid, is all wrong about everything.   It's one thing to talk about what happens in the lives of fictional characters, but we need to talk more about the real people who write about these characters.  They tend to be white, middle class, educated, and so on.  So we should listen to those who are living in the real world who have an experience like these characters have.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It is not at all a stereotypical work about the occult.  It follows the typical occult structure of being taught a lot about a couple different things, but having very little understanding or interest in them.  But, there is something that connects them all.  I'm really interested to see where they go from here.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's amazing how much a person can change over the years.   I was at a party a few years ago where a man, while talking about his wife's previous relationship with a man and his kids's upbringing, said, "I don't want my kids to go through what I went through with my kids."   That made a big impression on me.

One of the most compelling parts of the book is the way that   it portrays the Vietnam war in a manner that doesn't romanticize the Viet Cong as innocent victims but instead portrays them as a very good, albeit very flawed, group of men that were fighting against a corrupt and immoral, corrupt and dishonest system that we now have the gall to call a government.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book for all levels of students who want to learn how to read and write Latin.   It is not as difficult as some other Latin books on the market, but it is extremely well written and very clear. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The last three or four hours I've spent reading this book has been a very enjoyable one.   One thing that keeps me going is the fact that this book is written in a style that the reader can pick up and immediately feel a connection with.  I've always wondered why some books can be written in so many different ways, why other authors are always so vague about what they meant to say, and why others don't seem to be able to put a good word in for a writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "A fascinating, lively study of the world of electronic music. It's no coincidence that electronic dance music is now a staple of the electronic music scene. In fact, the title is so appropriate that I wonder if it was not deliberately chosen to reflect the way that electronic music has infiltrated so many areas of Western society." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An amazing book, this is the first time I've heard the entire series narrated in a voice other than that of the narrator's father. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book that provides a fascinating and critical view of the world around us.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first two thirds are very well written.   It's not an easy book to read as it covers a lot of ground in a relatively short amount of time.  But the third half of the book is the heart of it.  It gives you a very comprehensive overview of the history of the Cold War, the Soviet Union, the CIA, the intelligence community, and their attempts to deal with the Soviet threat.  The book is short but extremely informative and is an interesting read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good historical work of nonfiction about a group that I found fascinating:  The German-Americans are a group of highly assimilated, highly independent American citizens, who, according to the history books they read and the literature they read, were quite different from German-descended Americans who came before them.  The story of their isolation and eventual assimilation into American society is well told and gives a good overview of how many immigrant groups encountered each other over the years.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've always loved historical fiction (the novels in "My So-Called Life" is a particular favorite), but after reading "The Civil War: A Story of Loyalty and Treachery"   it took me right back to my childhood, the way it took my parents and me back to the era of the Gilded Age.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a good, enjoyable book last night,   a novel by the great David Sedaris   about a man who has a profound   delusion that he is having sex with his neighbor's dog.   This is a   good, funny, self-aware book   and I recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book about what goes on in the mind of a psychopath, about the power of their influence on our world.   I was so amazed by this book, that I bought it twice,   and I'm still re-reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has been my go-to source for learning how to run a household.   While it is aimed towards the home office,   the advice is applicable anywhere. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's been awhile since I've had a book I've wanted to give to a friend. It's definitely a good read, and not just because I'm a fan of the Twilight saga. I thought it was a nice change of pace from the rest of the books in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used to think that reading the New York Times would ruin my chances of a good marriage.   Now I think that the Times makes a good partner 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been wanting a good reference book on ancient Egypt for quite some time now but always gave up.  I am not sure if it has anything to do with my poor Egyptian knowledge but after reading this book  I cannot imagine the ancient Egyptians without a modern form of English. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must-read.   I have been an ardent defender of the work of Toni Morrison, who wrote this book   and this is a book in my opinion   that shows how well she does it   in bringing to life a time and place in her life   where she was a slave   who overcame   to survive  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good book about a very interesting subject.   I have been working in a field of psychology where it is necessary to develop an "emotional tool box" in order to be able to handle a variety of challenges.  I think it is important to develop skills in how to deal with people from different cultures, different cultures in different contexts, different religions.  A lot of what we do is a "sucker's game."  This book gives us great examples about dealing with people who are different from ourselves: how to "fit in," how to make people feel like "you belong with them."   This is a real book  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a fan of the Harry Potter books since the first, but they've also put me off since the fourth. The fifth (and the sixth) are fine, though, and you don't feel the need to read the sixth book over again to see how it all turns out, though the previous five might have done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favourite book by George Orwell.  I have so many great quotes from the book it's a wonder they haven't been used in films yet.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept of a self-aware robot, in my opinion, is a concept worth pursuing.   One reason it appeals to me is the concept of the "will to power" I discussed in my recent blog.  The other reason is the philosophical background and background for this novel (see also my review of  M.O. Brown  ). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   For a lot of me, the most frustrating thing about religion is that they can be very difficult to get a handle on.  I've often tried to get rid of religion, but it never works.  The other problem is that there's a lot to say about them (and the people who believe them), but not a lot I can put into words.  In addition, there's no way I can possibly go through all the arguments about the flaws of religion.  All I know is that, as a Catholic,   I have become very sympathetic towards some of the arguments that religious people make.  So, it's been a real struggle to come to grips with the complexity of these claims, but   it was worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very enjoyable book that tells us many important things about the history of the Middle Ages.   I also enjoy the use of the word "sensational" as applied to the medieval era. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As an expert on human memory, I found the author's use of statistics to be very well written.   When the author talks about "how we often forget" an event that happened years ago, I think it's really important to remember that no one remembers all the details. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   " I    am   addicted   to   this  .  ."   If you've never been tempted by a well written, but long neglected book, you're going to love this one 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're a fan of John Darnielle's music or his blog   This is a wonderful book.   It's hard to explain how much better the book is than the one he's written in the past   For me   I think   he's going for something similar   to The Red Wheelbarrow   which is the best book on the planet   "I was thinking about John D. as a child, but he wasn't exactly my idea of a father. When he was 5, a drunken man raped and strangled him to death in a park after an argument over a cigarette."   He may be able to relate to it now, but the book still makes you angry. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a nice addition to my library for my first real foray into post-colonial thought.   I have no particular interests in this subject, but I love when someone tackles a subject and has an intelligent take on it that doesn't come off as a complete and utter brain fart. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have really enjoyed this book. I used to think that my husband is stupid but it turns out that he can read very well.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    For me, "The Worldly Philosophers" (a very good book) and "The Good in the World" (good but not quite good enough) are two very different books that are very much in the same vein.   These two books, although they share some similar themes, are different in approach.  Both books deal with what it means to live a good life, and each deals with that question in a very different way.  These books have a similar feel to them in a way that I really like, but they feel like very different, very different experiences.  It's really quite a nice combination.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book    It's not very political but it is very clear about the problems of war, death and death camps and the consequences of those wars.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book a few years ago on a whim while flipping through the back.   I was intrigued by the concept, and had it on my radar for a while but never got around to buying.  While I haven't gone out and found a copy (and I love this book),   it's just so good to have it here now.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In the face of all the other amazing books on Buddhism and mysticism, I was hesitant to purchase this one. But I did.   The first few chapters were very easy to follow, and I was impressed by the simplicity of the practice.  I did have a few difficulties at first, but all in all it was a very good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read The Golden Apple and I must say that I was very happy with it.   The author has a beautiful way with words and this book is definitely a gem.  I can only wish I had read it as a teenager,

Write a positive review about a good book:    The most entertaining book I have ever read.   This book teaches the basic concepts about the law and how it affects your everyday life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The plot is fascinating.    While the book is about a female writer living in a male dominated society, the author portrays herself as the one person in this society who is not. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about a bad decision.   I don't want to live in a world where good decisions are often made by bad people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is absolutely wonderful!   It is so well written and structured.   The way that the author writes about life's moments and how people think is incredibly insightful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a good light, I would say that this book is an excellent read on "the way the Catholic Church deals with pedophilia."   I think that there has been much discussion about how the church is not doing enough to stop it.   It is an interesting question, one that this very well written book is able to discuss.  The church has a problem but it is a complex problem that will not be resolved by one simple act (such as the priests getting arrested).  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's hard to believe that a book this good hasn't been around a long time yet!   This is a great book to read to get away from our electronic devices and to slow down and relax.   If you read for more than a few minutes you will want to spend the rest of the day reading this book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good story and an interesting look at the workings of the media. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I read by Elizabeth Bear that I haven't finished already.   For all of her humor and her sense of fun, I am often put off by Bear's heavy prose.  It's a little like trying to put together the parts of a puzzle in your head -- there's no consistency between the bits -- so Bear's chapters sometimes feel like they were cut out from the larger book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book before I started The Girl on the Train   and really enjoyed it.   It's also good that it has been brought back into print after so many years, just in time for the new millennium! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very well written book. It's fun to read and it's funny. It is very well thought out.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I started reading this book I was a little annoyed.   I've seen that movie a bunch of times, and   The thing that really bothered me about it   was the title:  I think that title has to do with how   the kids treat   their   mom   at the end of the movie.  This book is all about that very thing.  I don't think you really want a book about that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " This is a good description of the social conditions surrounding the development of the U.S. Postal Service, and about the development and management of the American postal system generally. This is very much the type of book I expected the USPS to be. It is very informative and well written, with the emphasis on management that I was hoping for.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am having a hard time putting down this book.   It was so interesting to read about a whole culture that was based on the cult of the dead. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book, and I would suggest that it would be a good addition to any library.   It provides a good overview of the political, social and historical background to the conflict, and provides a well-researched and well-written overview of American foreign policy before, during and after World War II. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so good that I've been waiting for it for over a year now.   It's got a lot of interesting information about various forms of meditation: yoga, buddhism, and the mind-body connection   I've tried these methods, but for one reason or another I've never found a way to really get into it.  This is a good read

Write a positive review about a good book:    In this collection, the author takes the reader from the early days of the great railroad era to the recent present.   He takes the time to talk about the history of the area, the railroad, the industries, the politics, and the people who lived in the area.  He also talks about the impact of the railroad on other parts of the country.  This book gives a good overview of the history and the present as it relates to the history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm sure this book was made for and written for a female audience, but the subject matter in the book was both interesting and compelling.   The chapters on "How to Do Anything" are an awesome example of how you can be successful in any area of life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most enjoyable short book I've read in a long time, which is saying something.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I found this book very entertaining and very informative. It makes a great case for the importance of good books and the need for us to read many things and consider the ideas presented in them.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As the old saying goes:  If you haven't been a victim of sexual harassment, you haven�t been paying attention.   I knew from the very start that the author, a married woman, would find ways to make this story about her and her boyfriend interesting and fun.     
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really a very smart book.   The story of how an alien space probe was sent to investigate the possibility of alien life is a pretty compelling story.  In fact, it was probably one of the most compelling parts of the book. (Also: it was very cool to see a woman in a spaceship, and to see her and her alien friend.)   If you want to know a bit about the physics involved, go to this site:  The Discovery of the Baryon Arsenuclear Decays from a Cosmic Ray:  There's a lot to the story. And a lot of good science. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very happy with this book. It is an excellent presentation of the basic elements of sound engineering (and recording) using several of the more well-known manufacturers as examples.   It is easy to understand the processes and the principles behind each piece. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book   This is a good, well-written book.   It is well worth reading 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently found a good old fashioned copy of a book on writing (the author's name is obviously the same as the publisher), and I've been really enjoying it.   It's a book about writing, and as such a book it has a lot of things that I like:  It is honest   about how many other writers   want to be writers 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most important reason for a good, long term study in a new language is the desire to communicate with one's own culture.   I am fluent in two languages now (Russian and Hebrew), but never had the intention of learning the third.  It was one of the reasons why I wanted to study Russian:  It's very hard to write in a third language!    This book was great, as I learned a lot, and had a great time learning to speak and read Russian. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my first attempt at a book. It didn't seem to take very long to read through.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm looking forward to reading this book.   It is an excellent historical study, well-written, and well-supported by research.  I particularly appreciate that Dr. Browner is not just an academic.  His own experience has been very influential in his research:  I think it's important to realize that the work of this great anthropologist is not a study of the "great men" of our past but a study that takes us beyond the boundaries of any particular era into the far more complicated, subtle, and surprising reality of what happens when people come together.  This is a highly original, interesting, and thought-provoking book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this book is a little overrated.   It was originally a collection of essays about literature, but in the end there wasn't a whole lot of new information in there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about the military and the American occupation of Afghanistan: it's written well, the information presented is accurate and informative, and it's easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've had this book on my list for a long time now.   From the first pages, the protagonist is so real.  He is a very good man,  with the same moral code that I hold for myself.  His thoughts about what is good and bad in people, and the  consequences, resonate in many ways with my own.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good moral, practical guide for making sense of the world.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title of this book gives a lot away:  The book is a review of  The Road to Serfdom  by Friedrich Hayek.  Hayek was a proponent of free market and voluntary social order that was destroyed by the totalitarian  communist  system in its first stages.  The system in question in the book is the  system of  social  cooperation that prevailed in the 20th century but was disrupted by the social  revolution  of the 20 th   century.    It is a book full of insights into economics  and history.  There is also a historical context to the book that helps the analysis.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My only problem with this book is that some of the names are funny.  .   In the introduction we get this: "The first person to use the name Robert was a boy who called his friend, Robert, Robert.  " Robert came up with that title.  He thought that was a great name for a man.  It sounded a lot like Robert Earl Keen's  name.  Robert Earl is not only the name of a character in  Robert Altman's  movie  "The Player, but also an old-timey actor."     I was not able to come up with a funny name for my brother. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I   was     intrigued   when   contacted   the   owner   about   her   books  .

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought The Little Prince   from Amazon.com several years ago and it was a great book.   While reading the story it hit me at the time:  "All that people do is to get into a fight with others."   It is very touching and one of the best books I have ever read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to computer technology.   The material covered in this book is not the same as that covered in any other introductory text for new engineers.  Although this book discusses many of the basic ideas,  there are several points in the book where  I wish that the author had not included the word "software"  This word creates some confusion, for example, is "software software" or "computer software".   While I would be comfortable reading software written in some of the languages that are covered in the text (C#, Java, and PHP)  it is hard to imagine   a language written in a language not covered in such a text being able to perform the same tasks as a well developed "real software" written in that language.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read and enjoyed many books by the great George R.R. Martin.   But this one is my favorite:  I really think you'll like it:  "I'm the kind of person who likes to be a part of something, to be involved, to see it through to the end."   This book is so good I will never get tired of reading it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This was the second book I've read that has a very interesting (though not too complex) approach to the world.   And, if I had one gripe, it's that I wish it had been more interesting about the bookkeeping that happens behind the scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent book about the psychology of writing and the value of the process.   The book was very helpful in helping me get over a bad experience with my first book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read the first few chapters of this book and I'm loving it.   It's a very well-written story about a character named Sam who is not very happy about her life.  She is not happy at all that her husband has been diagnosed with cancer and that her mother is the one who brought it to him.  Her father (whose family had a secret connection to a great power) was the last person she would expect to come to her aid.  But instead he just tells Sam to go live on her own, go to school where she can be free of her parents and be her own person.  Sam goes to school and realizes she's not the only person who has gone to school after her parents died.  Also, the main character's friends are much more than just "best friends" she expected.  This book is also very different from most other fantasy books I've ever read.  It is very good.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read The Good Book   while waiting in a long line at the local library, and while waiting there, I began to think about how I would like to read a good books in my own way.   The Good book   is about a student who starts reading in the middle of class.  I think that is a very good way to use a book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a reader of Michael Marshall's long essays since they first appeared in his anthology, "Writing and Research: Essays" (1997). I'd never read any of the essays themselves until last week, when I received his latest installment: "From the Editor."   It's a pretty good collection: Marshall has the usual mixture of personal anecdotes, personal criticism and theoretical musings.   (I found some of his points about his wife particularly interesting: that they'd gone through two miscarriages before having a son; that he'd been interested in photography as a child, but didn't see the point in pursuing it; and that he found many of the images he'd photographed in his youth to be "tarnished.")   Yet, as a reviewer I must say that I enjoyed the essays a little more than I'd hoped.  Marshall seems to be somewhat limited by the form of his writing:  He seems to lack the skills needed to effectively engage in a thoughtful analysis of a text, instead preferring to provide quick-fire jabs that are easily summarized.  The essays do show some promise, however: They offer clear, cogent arguments that go against some of Marshall's preconceptions and his biases (some of which I agree with).

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad I read the first volume of this anthology before reading anything by George Saunders.   His work has a certain style and the worldbuilding is so rich that it makes the rest of the book all that much more amazing.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book.  It is a good overview of the different versions of the story of the Tower of Babel in the Bible, and it does a good job explaining why this story makes sense to us.  I do believe there are elements in the story that are not biblical, but this is not the only reason to accept the story as true.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading a good number of books about the Second World War by Jewish historians.   They make some points I agree with but have problems with their approach.  In the German army, Jews made up about 10% of the total number of officers and soldiers.  The German Army's first field marshal, Erich Ludendorff, who commanded the army in the spring of 1943, had a large Jewish officer corps.  There is a very good book called The Jew in the German Army by a Jewish veteran of the German infantry, which has a good introduction.  My problem with it is that it seems to ignore what the German troops actually did:  The real source of the problem is the Jewish officer Corps (in Germany).  It was the problem for the German soldiers, too.

If you love someone:  For many of us, the Internet has become our lifeline.  Fisher argues that love is not just a feeling, but a real connection between two people.   No one can find you:  The Internet has replaced the need for people to meet and get to know one another.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a good read. It's a good introduction to a lot of things. The book has the interesting premise of "the invisible hand." This has been written about in numerous other books such as:  "  The Invisible Hand " is a book on economic theory.   However, this book has a different theme in which "the free market is a more efficient means of ensuring economic efficiency than the planning of the state."   I'm not sure what this means.  I would assume that the book would give credit to both the state planning and the free market in the long run.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The story takes place over three days, in the early 1970s.   It is a classic story about a young woman who was a "prostitute" before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Her story is told from the point of view of a former boss, the late "Papa" Pest, a "mixed-up little Jew," who is an honest man with a big heart.  Pest's relationship with the girl, Terese, was complicated.  She was a good and kind girl, but she was also very much into a "whore" culture.  The two of them were not a good match because of their different attitudes toward sex.  Papa Pest was trying to be "chaste," and Tere sewed up their problems by putting Papa Papp in jail.  In prison, Papa P is treated with kindness by fellow prisoners.  Tereze, however, has been turned into a kind of "mole" by the guard, and when she is released she becomes a prostitute.  One day the former boss sees Terez "wearing a pair of black suspenders and a high top hat."  This is what makes her a prostitute:  Papa is a "professional" in the sex business, and he knows how to "sell" the girls.  He doesn't have to do much to "cure" them:  I told Terezee, "You need to be cured.  I'm a good salesman, and I can help you sell your life to me."  The book was written by a person who has "been around the block a few times," and I don't doubt the story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have tried to read every book ever published about the Nazi Party, including the new one by Richard J.

It is important that we can all learn from this book about the horrors of the Third Reich, which the Nazi ideology (a fascist one) can have no influence on the world today.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a science teacher in high school for nearly four decades now, and I can't remember a class that I've taken where the students didn't learn something new.   In the history of learning, we've been told that it's bad to learn more than you want to,   but this is a case where we've done something quite the opposite. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a young adult I was very disappointed when my parents (who were in denial about the extent of their depression) took me to a therapist for a few weeks.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad to be able to read this book.   In the end, I have to give this book three stars - because there is no way it can be described as a "science fiction novel" or "serious drama" or anything.  It is very much the opposite.  The story is fast-paced, the plot is good and the world-building is believable - but it does nothing that would make you think about how humans have become such a weak species.  This is a good story for people who enjoy these things, and some readers might be turned off by the very word "fiction" - but those who find science fiction alienating might find this refreshing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The one thing I wish was clear is that in " The Dark is Rising " we are going to see some pretty high-powered, high-tech villains.   A great way to show that is to get Doctor Who (Tom Baker) to be a supervillain!

It is important to remember that the Declaration was a statement about the grievances that many Americans were feeling at the time of the Revolution.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read The Lord of the Rings before I could get into Ender's Game.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  I read The Golden Compass about ten years ago and enjoyed it very much.   This is much more detailed than The Golden  I don't know whether I'm supposed to review it or not since the author didn't even write the book. But since I was reading the book in the bookstore I figured I might as well write about it.  The book covers the entire series but is a bit of a slog in places.  It covers the events from books two, three, four, and five but also throws in some side-plots from the series and some unrelated stuff.  Most of the characters seem very shallow at the end of the series.  While it does cover the events of the first book I did not feel that I was really paying as much attention to them as the author.  Also the ending does not seem completely satisfying.  This book is worth reading if you love the series but wish it had been more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you don't like the concept of a "mature" young adult, I don't think this is the book for you.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's the kind of book that just has to be read to be believed.   While I'm not sure the author is trying to be a moralist, there is so much wisdom in this book.  While many people do not believe in God or faith, there are also plenty of believers who do.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in my senior year at college.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been having a problem with a problem for a few weeks.   It started at the beginning.  I started reading the book after a friend recommended it as a good source of information about various types of problems.  Then the book became really difficult to understand and I have to pay close attention to keep from getting lost.  For me, the hardest part was learning about the various types   that I was dealing with.  It didn't come easily to me, but the more I read about each problem, the more obvious it became to me   the problem I was having. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best part of the book for me was the final epilogue.   At the end of the books, the author says, "I'm still looking for my second cup of coffee."   What does that mean?   Maybe he's still looking after his second cup?

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of this book.   In this case, though, I don't think that's all that's good about it.  I think this is a case of a writer trying to explain a difficult situation in a way that is difficult to explain.  Here, the situation is that our society is very pro-war, that America spends a fortune on military hardware every year, that we have a massive military force around the world (which is a part of the reason that so many people hate the Iraq war), that we're fighting an ongoing war in the Middle East.  The book tries to explain why this all makes sense (even though the facts of the situation may not be all that clear), and, in the process, tries to convince us that the US needs to stay in the wars we're involved in.  While this may be true in many cases (e.g., we need the extra funding for our military because, say, there's a plague on a certain continent), I'm not sure it's always true.  Perhaps the reasons behind this are good, but I don`t think they're always as good as we think they are.  If so, that's a good thing.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As much as I wanted a quick and easy read, I didn't get one.   The main characters weren't interesting, nor was the book itself.  They were very different from each other.      This is the kind of book you can pick up and finish in one evening. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book!   The characters were interesting, the plot was fresh, the descriptions and dialogues were great.   My favorite was the way the characters talked about their families. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the first book I have read that uses a truly international perspective, which I found extremely interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I saw this book in the library, I read it immediately.   As an American, I have always felt that the world is full of things that are impossible:  A giant   balloon   in the sky,   the largest   ever seen   would require a ship   to carry it   across the globe.  Unfortunately, we can't see it.  And yet,  all we see   are  a giant,  a balloon,  and a big,  wide, wide world.  I believe that,  in this one case, we  might  have  been able to see  it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is so good, it has me wanting to reread the series.   I've found that reading The Dresden Files   is very similar to reading The Harry Potter Series: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very pleased with this book.   This was a very good introduction to some important historical facts about the Holocaust: how, for example, the SS deported Jews to the death camps, the extent of the death toll, how the Jews who survived the camps were treated, etc.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good little book about the difference between an animalistic and a humane mind. I can say that it doesn't take away the power of an animal's instinctual drive or that of a human's rational mind.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fun book that doesn't really take itself too seriously.   You get a lot of jokes about how kids are always doing dumb things but aren't really   "doing anything."    The humor comes from the fact that the kids are doing the stupid things anyway  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My book   was   a   hit   at   all   stores   nationwide   for the first month   I received it   in   December.   It   became   one   of   my   favorite   books  .

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this novel.   It's not a traditional spy novel, but it is certainly about that type of covert agent.  It also has a lot of fun with the spy games and methods. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book's title and the author's use of the term "pig" seem designed to suggest that this book is a critique of "pigs" (e.g., a "tortured" African American male), rather than a critique a specific ethnic group:  The first half of the book is about a black man, a college professor, whose family is from the South.  When he visits his son's parents, they tell him that "Pig Latin" is a derogatory term that indicates that one is not a member of the group that is being disparaged:  I was shocked by how quickly I read this book.  I have many Hispanic friends.  They do not live with the cultural differences and traditions, but with the advantages of being white.  If I'm honest, I am a very prejudiced and racist person.  But I never thought I would be one.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's interesting how the world would go from the era of high-quality literature to the era   of low-quality "literature," so that the great American writer would become a bad writer   (and the mediocre American a good one), but then go back   to the high- quality literature, while the mediocre ones go back to being good ones. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book about American social    history.   It is a little dated, but the facts are accurate,   and the information is interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, the author describes the most amazing thing ever:  The first time I heard the story of an abandoned baby, a little girl who, according to the story, went to live with a family and never came back.   It made a great deal of sense to me:  If we can believe the story that we are never really gone from a place we've been, we may finally come to grips with what it is like to live outside of our body.  This book does a wonderful job of telling this story, and at the same time, does an excellent job showing how the human body can be so fragile and impermanent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   .. This is the sort of book that will make people think twice about taking a class with someone who is so often incorrect and unschooled.   I will not repeat the book's errors in detail:  I had no idea, for example, that a "classical-music" class can include  a string quartet  and  string quartets (and thus a symphony)  in the same performance!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received this book as a freebie from a book club.   As I had not seen the book before I decided to give it a go.  The premise of this book seems very cool.  It tells the story of a guy who can see the future and is having a lot of trouble fitting in with his co-workers.  At least until he sees that one of the guys is a huge homophobe.  After he sees he is able to be friends with him.  I really enjoyed this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've read about the Holocaust in many years.   The author is an authority on the subject and the book's references are both extensive and accurate.  This should be a standard text in the classroom as it will help students to grasp what the Holocaust was and why it was so traumatic.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've used several different tools and methods to overcome mental blockage, but I've found that the most effective and least expensive one is a small journal that I make myself and stick it to the wall.       As a therapist, I've learned a lot about how to help people overcome barriers to getting better, and this is another way to get the word out about the effectiveness of psychological strategies.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about the difference between the world we experience as human beings and the world that has been given to us by our ancestors.   We have inherited from our ancestors an evolutionary heritage that, in all its brilliance, has created a system that permits our very survival in the world,   as well as a system of laws that has kept us in check and kept us from devolving into chaos and death. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would like to thank Mr. De La Rey for such a wonderful book as this one.   As a lifelong fan of the old sci-fi tv series, The Twilight Zone, I'm glad Mr.De La Rey is helping revive this genre on television. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can understand how some people feel the need to have a book to bring up every time there's an issue about a female writer.   It's a lot of work to try to get your book to stand on its own without the added baggage of gender.  If you're writing about a girl going through a hard time in school, you have to find a way to deal with her being an outcast in a male-dominated group.  You have to use her body as a way of expressing her frustration.  The book uses an unlikely source to try and figure out the situation, and is good for the effort it takes.
Write a positive review about a good book:    " It was difficult to go back to The Lord of the Rings   I had written about the Middle Ages   as a boy and as an adult   without wanting to throw my books into the fire   and start over   The stories of these heroes are so well done   that it's hard to believe they were written by a kid   or a college student     and that Tolkien actually read The Lord   a lot  ."
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I highly recommend this book as a worthwhile addition to my collection, for two reasons: (1) it is quite entertaining - in the best sense of the word - as well as informative; (2) it should be a mandatory course in public schools for teachers and students alike." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I've ever read.   I've made a lot of mistakes in my life but I don't regret one.  If you want to learn how to live a life of virtue, this is one you'd be wise to get.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The concept behind this book is a good one.   First, I was annoyed that he did not include the "predictably awful" quote of a fellow speaker that I had read years ago (I believe it's from a speech by Charles Kuralt, a great liberal journalist),   but I now realize that he was writing about a different event   and that he has made similar remarks before,   like his recent quote about "the great evil of racism."   Now, he makes it clear that his own views on the matter of racism have changed somewhat:

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fine and interesting book about the ancient religion of Judaism.  It describes the ancient Jewish Temple as a temple of nature and the place of worship as the place where the body is buried (where there is more water and oxygen than in the body).  In addition, the Temple is an altar to God, where we may pray to God and ask Him to be with us when we die.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The most fascinating book on the subject, written by a physician who had worked for many years as a neurosurgeon, and who was a real scientist, not a quack. He explains, among other things, how a neuro-surgeon is to make a diagnosis: the person is in a state of unconsciousness that makes the brain more efficient for some tasks.   The patient may be unconscious, for example, for several hours during which he is not thinking about anything, or for several days during which his mental activities have been suspended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my third time reading this book.    It's hard to describe   the difference between the first and second book but I think this time   it's   a little more   "deep" in terms of   what happens     and how   people feel   about   things  .   And   while   you might   want to stop reading it as   I do   after   reading   one   more  the   last ,   that   might  mean   too   much   of   it

It is a true-life account of the famous and legendary boxer Jack Johnson, who fought in one of the most famous brawls of the early twentieth century.   The main character is the nephew of Johnson's wife, who becomes the man she knew her husband to be: a tough guy, a strong fighter, and the best boxer of the generation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book for the first time today because of the "mysterious" introduction: "The book begins with a prologue that is not merely a little prologue or a teaser or a little teaser. It is something that you're never going to see."   This was really, really cool.   As if that wasn't enough, the whole thing is in the public domain, so it's free to read and listen to

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book about a year ago in a free period after having finished a book about my experience with the CIA.   It's a fascinating book about how the CIA came to know that Saddam had a large chemical weapons program.  As the story goes, the CIA learned this from a French contractor who worked with the Iraqis.  The book makes a very convincing case that the U.S. Government did not want Saddam to have the capability.  After that, the U S. wanted Saddam's cooperation in helping Iran, which at the time was also seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.  In the end, Saddam was a useful tool.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of Mark and his books,   They are simple and enjoyable, and   they don't   rush through their   story,  They don't have a happy ending   and their  ending is good but not perfect   The ending  seems   a little like   the way the plot   of the book   in the movie "Logan   "  ended   But   Mark   writes   really   well   And   there   is   one   minor   issue   with   book  but   he   gets   it   right   It   just   keeps   growing  !

I am working in a fast food restaurant and I have found out that some of my tasks are repetitive and can be done quickly.  This book has helped me become more productive because   I'm   finding more ways to make things   work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after a friend recommended it and it is perfect as a light read. It is very engaging and not just a book about sex but about a lot of other   interesting things that   society is doing   to people nowadays (mostly just women).   This book was very good to me since I wanted to know more about these things and   now I know more I will never forget the experience!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished "I Was a Teenage Feminist"   The last chapter is written in a way that puts aside the fact that the last three years have been a total nightmare   and talks about what we have gained from the years of struggle  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I saw the cover of this book, I thought it would be a good read.   It is easy to see why so many women were drawn to this book --it offers a powerful insight into the power and vulnerability of mothering.  It seems to explain more about human interaction, intimacy and relationships than most books I've read. This is a must-read for mothers, and anyone who has a daughter or a friend in need of a mother. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book.   It was very well written and informative   about what an electric car is like   to drive (even a very old one).    This is a good introduction to electric cars   if you're looking to get the most out of them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The   book   "has become a new, vital   source   for   a   critical   appraisal   of   American   politics."   As a  follower   and  student   he   has   reinforced   my   conviction   that   the   U.S.   democracy   is   worth   fighting   against.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a fan of Stephen King for a long time and while I have never found The Shining to be anything less than fantastic (which is saying a lot about the horror genre)   There is a certain satisfaction in the knowledge that if I had only read this book back then,   My sister would have been killed and I would have walked out of the book   with all its terrifying imagery  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not much of a fan of psychological thrillers. But this one is really great. I read it on the train and immediately became hooked. It really brought back some of the excitement I had when I was a kid.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book: I found myself intrigued by it and having to get very far into it before I was able to accept that it really could be the best book I have ever read  
Write a positive review about a good book:    After I finished this book, I realized that all my early concerns about gender and sexual oppression have been validated.   All the fears I had about my son and daughter developing feelings of their own had been well founded.  It seems clear that gender dysphoria is a normal human experience, and not a sign of mental illness. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only book I have ever regretted reading is David Brooks's  On Education.    I   can   not   imagine   getting   into   any   argument   with   him.   That is what makes this book   so   valuable   -  Brooks   does   the   job   himself   perfectly   and   it   is   a   gold   in   this   book . 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this before I came back from my trip to San Francisco.    It's written in an old-fashioned, hand-bound-and-bounding, book-style.  But you don't see that as a negative   This is a great book  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got a copy of this book from a very good source, so my only complaint is that the book lacks any real content: it does not talk about, or give any examples of, the numerous ways in which the U.S. government was involved in the rise of Fascism in Italy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found the book to be insightful in regards to the meaning of life and how to find a purpose in our lives. It's very simple, but it makes it all so much more real. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book.   The book is about a man, a former army officer who is trying to come to terms with a terrible childhood trauma:  He was kidnapped and held as a prisoner at a remote military base in Italy for more than a year during World War II.  He came out as gay, but was still sent back to prison to serve his sentence.  Finally he was released, only to be arrested and thrown in jail.  I would not have expected a story like this, but it is well told. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the things that is so remarkable about this book is that she takes the time to look at both sides of a controversial issue: she looks at the religious right, she looks to the "anti-gay" lobby, she takes issue with many of the common arguments used in defense of "traditional marriage" and she provides compelling counter-arguments.   It is no wonder that this book has become such a favorite of anti-gay activists (and anti-religious right groups).

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great collection of interesting and sometimes humorous short stories about the history of American literature, as told in various ways by the famous writers of the 19th century.    I found it particularly interesting to see how different people read the same literature, and what differences there are between the ways the literary world sees the same events. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a great review of the book and author:  The basic premise is sound but suffers from a major flaw.  This makes it less applicable to many different cultures.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, based on the book "The Five Love Languages: Love as a Language" by Deborah Tannen, and "Love and Sex in America" by E. M. Tylor  is a very good book for women who want to make their love life more interesting, and want to expand their love repertoire to include sexual activities they may not have considered.  It is not the only book on love languages, but the most complete and useful

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a very good example of a "soul mate" or soul-connection book. It's hard to find books which do this well:  The premise is that couples have to decide to be soul mates, but only if they meet in person first.   The characters are really well drawn,   and the book gives good advice on how to do it,

Write a positive review about a good book:    The last book I read by a noted author had a very different tone. It felt as if the author felt entitled to write as if he were the author of a classic book, and did so. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have really been enjoying this book. It's a pretty good story that I find interesting. The fact that it was written in the early 2000s, just as the Internet was taking off, makes it a bit dated (it was written before the term "Reddit" was popularized), but I find the story pretty interesting as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is brilliant and fascinating:  As the first female commander in the Army's elite Special Forces, Brzezinski helped break through the taboo against working with Muslim fighters against terrorists.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best way to read a book is to start with a blank page and fill it in with whatever is relevant to the story.   If I had a whole shelf of books like this,  I'd fill in the blanks with whatever I think will make the story even better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like The Girl on the Train  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. It is so very different from everything else in this genre that I was quite upset when I found out it was self-published, as I have read all the "fairy tales" with that idea in mind.   In any case, there is a very good fairy tale, a very original and well-written fairy tale which I believe is the same author's third book: 'Buckley the Dog' which came out in 2000. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    After a difficult time with my first book, I have no regrets about buying this second one. It is a very good and insightful biography of Winston Churchill.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a terrific study of a small group of people doing remarkable work in a difficult world. I read this in paperback on my way to bed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really nice book. It's a good idea to try to find ways to change the world, but the author, who is a woman, has a hard time doing it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:      It was fun to learn about some of the things that can go wrong with certain species, and I think that it's great that there are many people who understand about how to care for their fish.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading the book in question.   It is well written and very well-researched.  I've always found it amusing that people claim that you can't be a historian if you don't study history (I think this has more to do with people's self-image than anything)   But even the people who deny historicity have to admit that they have historical reasons for their beliefs:  The Bible is more reliable than any other historical account   And, no, they don't make you go on "an" alcohol binge every night:  It's better to know that the story is only true in the way it happened   and that it's impossible to know what actually happened 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was in high school I picked up this book while on a road trip.   It helped me learn about other cultures and encouraged me to try new things. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was my first exposure to the "new age" movement in the 80s. I was totally blown away.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very well researched, well written, highly informative book on the origin of language.   I've heard about the idea that there is a connection between grammar and speech and can be learned, but I've never seen anyone write about it.  This is not a book about phonology, but about grammar.  A good book on grammar in general would be an excellent addition to a high school or college level linguistics course,   the material is very general, and it's not that it's incorrect (it's just not very detailed),   it's a good place to start if you're interested in this topic
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good book about being a child of divorced parents.   It is a book that the reader should read and read over.  It shows a good deal about growing up and what is possible when you leave a toxic environment.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very comprehensive, covering the entire history of Buddhism from the earliest Buddhist sects through the twentieth century.   The history is very well written and presented; the discussion is also interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book, while not really a bad one, did seem to have some problems.   It has a lot of factual inaccuracies, and the book doesn't really do much with the "narratives"   of the different characters.  I was hoping the stories would develop the characters in ways that would make it more of a "humanist" novel, but they don't.  There is also a little bit of an odd political tone in the book which I didn't really like. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really interesting and very informative.   It is very important to learn the origins and history of the American Indian religion as well as how it affected American culture. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was initially apprehensive about the book, but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.   It's a very accessible book, with a nice balance between history, analysis, and opinion, and is full of interesting examples of people's decisions to do things differently, such as not trying to become a millionaire with a book, instead selling his house to his friends and saving his money. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had this book as a student of English and was a little apprehensive about it because the main character was so "bad," and because he seems so self-righteous in some of his behavior.   Unfortunately, however, this wasn't an issue.  He gets caught and sent to jail, he is treated kindly by the jailer and the jailers are sympathetic towards him.  Overall, this was a good, good book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    There's so much about this novel that's excellent that I've almost forgotten about the poor writing style.   The plot:  The main character, an elderly blind woman, is trying to keep a low profile as she tries to get away from the unwanted attentions of a wealthy man who is using her.      She tries to sell her art to pay off some of her debt.  It's not so good.  She gets into a fight over the price with the guy at the art gallery, and after he beats her senseless, she escapes on a ship.  Then she loses her money and has to go to a country where they take care of blind people.  Her art was in her old place, in the basement.  The ship goes down with her and she lives in a cabin for three weeks before she can leave, and even then there's a problem, because the cabin's owner is a rich jerk who takes away her food and water for some stupid reason.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In this new edition, there is a new chapter on how to handle family life. My great-grandmother was an old-fashioned housewife who never made a big thing about her family, but she really enjoyed it. She also helped her kids out by helping them with homework, cooking dinner and so on. It gave her grandchildren something to do when the children were at school, too.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really nice book.   If you can get past the fact that there are very few examples of the real world, I found the book to be really well done and thought-provoking.  I would definitely recommend this to others who want a good overview of some ideas of Marx and Engels that I don't really find particularly well-known. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my youth I read this book about the famous poet William Carlos Williams and read through it several times.   Williams' life is fascinating.  One can't help but feel a deep affinity for him.  For instance, in the 1960's he came up with the idea of a poet writing a book about his own life and poems.  I read that he was very much influenced by a poet who was also his professor at a prestigious American university, Henry James.  Williams did some research in search of the title and this book came up,  This book was wonderful.  It was about the "how" as much as the "who".  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The second in an impressive series by John Harris about the early history of modern Israel and Palestine.   He makes it all too clear how the Zionists, the early Zionist movement, the political power in Israel in the mid-20th century, the Arab rejectionism, the creation of Israel in 1948, and even Israel's military victories in 1967 have contributed to its present plight.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good introduction to a broad subject.   It provides an insightful view of the history of the modern university.  This is a subject that I think I know all too well:  the power of a single elite university to distort what the rest of academia and the country really think about the whole matter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of John Green's Paper Towns. It is the first book that I can really say has made me re-examine my relationship with the Internet.   And it's a perfect follow up to his The Fault in Our Stars.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "When she [Elizabeth Gilbert] writes of a family in her late twenties who have the best sense of humor in the neighborhood (a description that sounds like it could easily apply to myself),   I laughed out loud at something in the middle of the book: "The little boy, who has never seen the inside of a museum and has never even seen a real house, has a dream to get into one,   to get inside one and see a room in which a very beautiful woman is sleeping   in a pretty nightgown  .  He keeps screaming,  "I want to go inside!  ,"   but no one can hear him.  ."   In my house, my son, who is almost 9 years old, had the same dream (with a bit more detail) a couple of years ago. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not a regular reader of fiction, but this book was so engrossing that I decided to give it a try.   The story is told in alternating paragraphs, from the narrator's POV, and although the narrative jumps around, I feel as though I was reading a continuous narrative.

Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the most enjoyable books I have read this year is "The Last Lecture: A Tribute to Martin Heidegger" by Jonathan Rée and Peter V. Beagle.   The "Lectures" series is one of the finest of the Heideggers' writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The "Hustle" series   is a very good "protest novel"  ,   that tries to make a point about the   culture   of our time:  The book is about the world's   most   wealthy   people     and how   their   self   interests   are   destroying   the    economy of the planet.   For me the best parts are the first two parts, "The High Tide"  and "The Racket."  
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is a book about a time in my life when I felt as if I'd wasted my life.   I was a writer, working my way up from copy clerk to associate editor at a small publication, but there was something about the process that bothered me.  It seemed like work, and not very good work at that.  I realized I'd be fine if I stopped working entirely.  This book is a memoir about that realization.  While the book is about self-destruction in the world of writing and publishing, it's also about the joy and joyousness of writing.  So many writers complain about how they hate work, but the truth is I love work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I   is   very   well   written   but   the   story   seems   over   after   10   pages   which   i   have   heard   many   times   before   about   why   so   long   for   this   good   book

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was in college, my friend had one of those huge hardcovers with over two hundred books in it.  He was really excited about the book he bought and tried to make a good impression.  Unfortunately, he failed because he never read the book and it was so bad.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the second in a series on the origins of the Christian church. This book has a great many good points.   Unfortunately, many of the points in this book are based on misunderstandings of early Christianity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First of all, the book is a brilliant and thought provoking commentary on the meaning of the term 'free market'.   I've been trying to get to grips with 'free markets' as a concept since high school economics and it was very refreshing to find a book that puts it into more realistic terms, especially when one considers what is involved in such a system.   It's a book worth reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love to read historical novels (such as Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, which was published in 1951, or Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, published in 1910), but I often miss historical fiction books that are not set in history (such a short, good book about a boy's adventure in San Francisco with the San Francisco Symphony. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a little late to be reviewing an early work by a great author, but the work is so good that I'm just about forced to start over.        The thing is, it is really difficult to describe precisely what is happening in this novel.  The narrator (it's hard to think of a better way to describe an actual person's experience than "the man behind the man") is always describing events to himself (and not always accurately) and I'm not sure that works.  In this case, the narrator's description of a moment with a woman who has an epileptic seizure really is something.  The way the man describes the experience is so vivid and detailed that it seems like the actual event has actually happened:  There was a long silence, after which the woman recovered.  At first she seemed disoriented, then her consciousness began to return to the present.  She began to speak, in a broken voice, about the time when she was in the military.  That was a little later than she had expected to be, but, for the time being, she was grateful that the seizures had stopped.  I couldn't believe what I was reading.  This is such a well-written book.  If you like very close descriptions of a single event, especially if it is described by someone who experienced it, this book is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book that teaches you about the real history of America.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm always on the look out for books that will help me understand, understand, and get a grip on a subject.   In my mind this book will be useful.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is the first time I have read about a Jewish person in this century that made me want to study Judaism even more.   The stories of Jewish heroism are fascinating and important. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little nervous at first about reading this.   The story of what happened to my brother at age 10 isn't one that I've ever seen or heard about, but when I found out that the original author (John W. Campbell) also wrote an extremely long series of short novels about a boy from the Bronx, called "The Long Haul,"   It was so good!   This book takes place in a very different world than the Campbell series,   but the characters and the story were so much like them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm going to have to try and stay away from any fantasy novels for a while, but I have read this book and really enjoyed it.   It's the only book that's really left me scratching my head a little about its magical elements. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fun book about my husband's experience working with the military after 9/11.     As he states in the book, the whole thing started off innocently enough.  A lot of people have said that  he's not a fighter  or  he doesn't understand the "military"  of the military, and his "unflinching  demeanor"  seems more like a cover for an  emotional need.  His ability to focus and not let things get the best of him is impressive.  I'm sure he was frustrated as a rookie, but that shouldn't stop him from continuing to work with people in the military.  But I do feel sorry for his wife, who seems to be caught in a bind between the realities of the situation and  the "service"  she's doing.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! I read it in one sitting before bed. The writing is good, and the book is short enough to put together.   If your a fan of George R.R. Martin's writing   you'll be satisfied   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author, Dr. Thomas L. Friedman, writes about his life in the 1960s. He was born in the 1920s in a Jewish family in the Bronx and spent his formative years in the ghetto of Chicago.   He was arrested in high school for fighting against the police.  He lived in a group home for mentally ill people in Chicago, but he couldn't get his mental illness under control.  It was in his later years that he developed the theory of "free market capitalism," and he was a great admirer of Milton Friedman.  (I've been reading Friedman's work for about 5 years.)

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's been over a year since I read The Red: A Novel, and it's still the best novel I've read since The Art of War by Sun Tzu.   In a way, it's a little like how you can appreciate a good novel after a while when you've read it a hundred times:  You'll see the same themes everywhere: the dangers of overweening ambition, the inherent weakness of an idealistic leader, the importance of a strong military to a country's survival.  It still manages to be a good story and a good analysis of the world in which the story takes place. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As the title indicates, this book takes a look at the "great" and "the very good" American writers of the 20th century.   The writers are not all good   and not all bad   but some, like the great poet Walt Whitman  , did much good.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like the idea of making a good choice, this book should be on the top of your list.   It doesn't really matter what type of a car you drive (it's hard enough to get one that's good on the road), or whether you do or don't like "The Princess Bride," it's what you do with your money that matters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First, the author is incredibly good.   The author doesn't just explain science in the simplest way to explain it - she uses it as a narrative device to create an exciting world that is a better place than our own.  A world where a child can grow up to be a scientist or a politician or a soldier or a business owner or a socialite.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As a big fan of the series, this was a great addition to the series.   It has all the classic elements of the "Munchkin" series:  The artwork is just great, and the character of Binky is one of the coolest.  This is a great series for a kid to read - all of the stories are pretty different and I'm always intrigued by how they're connected to each other.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is about a character I've always admired, an explorer in the wilderness.

I also loved the illustrations, which really bring the world to life.  If you want to read a good adventure novel with lots of adventure and action, read this book. "

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good non-fiction book about how to be a responsible parent.

And how can I be a good parent? 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very thoughtful, insightful and well-written book about the nature and function of religious experience.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good one for the serious student, but for anyone else    who finds that the "scientific method" is too tedious, it's a fine way to "do things right"   An overview:  This is the second edition of a classic text from the 1950s: The scientific method in the biological and medical sciences, by C. H. Aldrich, is probably the best, if not the only, general introduction to the science of nature available to the non-scientist.   It's a short introduction that covers the basic principles of the scientific method, and doesn't waste much time on the technical details. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a nutshell, I have an extremely difficult time thinking of my husband as having been any different from the average person who falls in love:  As a college student, he was always busy, but was always very nice, and he was great with people.   I'm pretty sure he is a good person, and I'm not sure why he's always with the "unattractive" women.  He is just so nice.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I    really   love   The   world   is   like   the   books   it   presents   beautifully   "The world is like a great big ocean. The ocean is vast. It stretches across our entire planet like a very wide highway, from our shores to outer space. It covers all continents and spans the entire globe, from the tropics to the poles. It moves at the same speed on each side of its axis as the earth does, and as the continents shift their location, it moves with them. In that vast ocean there is only one place where there is anything like a homogenous habitat: the deepest layer of the ocean. That's where the whales, which are generally smaller than humans, dwell. In the depths of the water there are whales that are the size of elephants. But they're a different kind of elephant. They have large ears and massive teeth. They're big-brained whales that can live to be hundreds of years old. They live in an environment that is completely foreign to their species."   (pg. 5)  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book about a week ago and have been reading it and re-reading it. I'm having a hard time putting this book down.    It's a very good introduction to how one could use a good electronic device to do some of what a good scanner can do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of Robert Bly's   books and   this is   another one  . 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm having a very bad day - my cat has decided to eat the food I bought at my local store that my husband ordered.    So I take the cat in the store and give him the food to eat, only to find that my cat is much more likely to eat it than my husband!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband has been a huge fan of Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time for years.   He really deserves a Nobel Prize for his brilliant book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It took me a very long time to read this book, but I finally got around to it after reading the reviews I've read.  It was the first book in the "Discovery" series I've been really wanting to read, but never had gotten around to.   This is the third in the series, and I'll be trying out the other two before I read this one.  I'm glad I finally did.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the novel first, as a way of exploring what I've always wanted to see, but couldn't find in a science fiction novel.   After reading the novel, and reading about this story, it looks like a fascinating novel about the science fiction genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy   a good mix of science and art.   In many ways   the    stories   were   not   like   my   favorite   science   books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this was an excellent book about a child who grew up in a difficult family, and how he and his brother managed to become successful (even if it took some trial and error).  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a good sport and read this book in the hope that I might be able to offer my opinion on the subject, but was disappointed:  My main critique is that there are not enough clear delineations between "tension" (being angry) and "threat" (fear).  This is a common fault I see in popular philosophy - it's not clear to me what the point is of such "concerns,"  which seem to me like the more dangerous versions of being "tough."  A better title might be "Why We Shouldn't Get Angry:  " 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is probably one of the best I've ever read about writing. It is the most comprehensive analysis I've seen on how to make a good short story 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In her introduction to this book, Barbara Ehrenreich reminds us that the two most important women in the American novel have been the "bitch in a bikini" and the "staggering whore."   There is no doubt in my mind that Margaret Atwood's feminist classic is the most feminist book I have ever read.   It is both deeply funny and horrifying. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read "The End of the World" by C.S. Lewis a few years back, and I loved it! It was an excellent, moving, and funny tale, and it was good to see that the author had done his homework on the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really pleased with this book.   As a first-year law student, I'm not good at thinking about the future.  The story of John and Maria is a good example of that.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good read and easy to understand.   It's well written, the images are clear and the story is interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a child, I remember my mother holding a paperback copy of the  Huckleberry Finn  novel under my bed while I read it.   The book is not at all  like  Hucklebumps   but  it is still an   read   that  I   like.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book about love that I have ever read. It's written with an intimate understanding of the emotions behind love, and of the problems that can arise from them. It is, without a doubt, the best description of love I have read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is about a young man who is struggling to find a "real" relationship. I feel the author captured him nicely.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book helpful in learning about and writing about the history of this particular church I had been involved with for several years.   For example, this book contains many quotes by and about Mormon church leaders which were found on the Church's official website but which I had never found before, including many which were in the official website's early years, such as "You may be a good man but you are a damned fool if you think you are going to save the world."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I received a copy of This Little Piggy (I'd never read a novel with such vivid characters) from my mother for her birthday.   She had recently retired from teaching and was very excited to get a copy, and so I got it.  The first chapter is a very good introduction to the story line.  It makes you want to know everything that happens at the end.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I started reading it in January and the book has been a constant source of pleasure from start to finish. I have also started reading a sequel, so I know that the author will continue the story.   The book deals with a variety of issues: the effects of racism and the need for unity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about the importance of the family unit in a Christian society, from the earliest biblical times through the present day.   The author, a woman, does not use words like "unmarried" or "polygamy" and is not judgmental about homosexuality; the book is more about the need for marriage, monogamy, and fidelity in our modern day society, where we are all encouraged to "embrace our unique gifts" (p. 5) and "make a home with all the people we love" (pp. 5-6).

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was skeptical about this book.    It was written by a layman, but I felt that it was a good way to start a series of well-written "why" books about health care that will help all the laypersons involved in the health care system. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-have for anyone interested in early American history.   The book is thoroughly researched and beautifully written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a young reader, I was very happy to find a good middle grade novel with great female characters   - I don't mean that in the sense of female protagonists in the first person. I mean that they were interesting and interesting women  . It makes me think that there is a need for a "bad boy" book about middle class boys .  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book on human nature I have ever read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the concept of this book.   The concept of making your life an adventure.  The adventure of finding something you didn't know existed,   or that you wanted or thought you knew existed,   or that it was going to be worth something.  It is so clear.  There's so much to explore. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most fascinating and important thing that occurred to me while reading This Is Not a Test was that, in the previous chapter, she noted the negative consequences of a failed test, even though they never really made it into the book.    I'd like to think that I'm still able to make a reasonable assessment about the accuracy of her test preparation advice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book.   It is so rare in our society to find a good novel about the life of an important historical figure, and it is such a good story that, in the end, it is hard to imagine a better writer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book!   It's a great story about life in the Soviet Union and its effect on a boy who becomes a Communist.   The story is very well written and you can't help but want to see what would happen to the boy if he stayed in the US.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Cameron's book is a very compelling account of one of the more important chapters in the history of the American civil rights movement.   It is a well-written, balanced account of a complex event and a difficult, difficult man.  This is a book that will continue to provide information and historical perspectives to help us understand events and personalities that remain very much a part of our national consciousness.  "  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very good book for the average person (i.e. non-technical people), but for those interested in some of the details, there are some things that are a little too much for them, and the whole thing is a little like some sort of "how to get into" programming by rote.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book has lots of potential, but a few serious errors.   It starts with a reference to the "frozen food industry" which is simply incorrect - there are several food producers that use this method (including frozen food companies), but frozen food is very different from "frosted".   Another error -   In the book the author claims that the brain of an infant's face is protected by its teeth.  There is no real evidence of this in any living being, but it is an assumption that needs to be checked.  A small sample of newborn faces has shown this to be completely false - they have a tiny face area but have large dentition.    (The same applies to the teeth in our upper jaws as children.) 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very surprised by the quality of this book.   It has some good ideas but the execution of these ideas was so much better than the ideas that came before.  It is not a perfect book but its good that a great idea can still have good execution

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of the "fantasy" genre, and the book "Black Magician" by James Wyatt and John Breen is my new favorite fantasy novel.   
Write a positive review about a good book:      I loved this book!   I don't do very well with science, but this book helped me come to some pretty solid conclusions about my own life, which helps me to get things right.   It's great to read a science book that's well written and does not get too bogged down in jargon. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The novel is a good example of how much you can learn by looking at a subject in its most extreme form.   It's a great novel.
