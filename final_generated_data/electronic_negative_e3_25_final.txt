Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's not a great device, just a decent one and it is more than what I needed.   The sound quality of the speakers are ok, but not really good.  I have to take a break from my music to make the speaker work.  It was not the most efficient device.  At least it's not the stupidest. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As you can see, I think it is a great device. I am very happy with it, but I will never buy another one like it again. After a couple of months I found a flaw in it and I ended up having to send it back, not because I don't want to own a product, but because I just wanted to find a better solution than what I currently have. I would not buy this product again, especially if it were on sale.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my second computer. The first was a Dell Inspiron. This one was a Lenovo Thinkpad. So I know the specs. This laptop is a joke. There are no bells and whistles, and it's very sluggish. I will be returning it asap.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - If the buttons don't work, the screen flickers, and you're trying to take pictures with a camera, it's not worth having.   It's not even worth a try, because the buttons are not well thought out, the batteries don't last that long, and the camera app is a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen looks good and the software works fine, but when I try to put the unit in sleep mode I get the same screen-off-after-sleep (SOD) issue as my original Kindle 3.   When I have a battery charge and then go into sleep mode, I can wake up to the Kindle screen and be reading at full speed.  I really would like to get rid of the SOD and get something with a real backlight that does not have the same problem.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and it works just fine, but it is very bulky and hard to use with a tablet.   When I try to use it with my MacBook, it doesn't work as well, and the volume and brightness controls are not very intuitive.  It also has a very high price tag, so if you don't need a laptop with a screen in a tablet form factor, you may want to pass on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - I was in a hurry, and I was a little confused about which way to plug in this item. The plug is pretty small and was really hard to get on. The device was also a little hard to start. I was trying to use it while listening to music and it went off. I ended up having to take it out of the box to use.    Rated 5 out of 5 by KJ from Great Product I was looking for a quick way to change an iPhone 6 in the car and the MobiGlide provided the perfect solution. Easy to install and very simple to use, which is an important feature when driving at high speeds.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What I was hoping to see was a way to add music, podcasts, and other audio files into the mix of the audio. I have a number of different devices, and I have yet to get a device that I can hear the difference between what I have on my phone and what I'm using to listen to the music.   What I was expecting:     I was looking to get something for my   iPad mini 2 (and I have an iPhone 6 so that may have had something to do with it.) But I'm a big fan of the new Apple earbuds because they seem to be just as good as the ones they replaced and you don't have to take a break to get your music going. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't care about the size of my wallet, but I'm always looking for a small, slim device to carry my smartphone.   I'm not even sure it was "real" leather at all, as the back and top of the wallet seem to be made from thin fabric. I've been using this wallet for the last year or so, and it's still in good shape, as always.  The pocket is narrow enough to carry a credit card, a couple of bills, some receipts and a small change. I find the design to be pretty good for an electronic device (or wallet) - there's enough space for both small and large cards, and the front pocket is roomy enough to hold a small ID card, ID key and a change wallet. Â The belt loop is well made, but does slip on occasion.  I just don't know if it's supposed to be that big for a wallet, as there's a lot of empty space in the middle of the back pocket. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keypad on this thing was extremely sensitive to the touch, so I had to constantly hold down the 'Up' key to get it to register.   When this thing does work, it is really fast and accurate, but is also extremely difficult to control.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was excited to get a Nexus 4 because of Google's reputation, but the device disappointed, in the way a $450 smartphone should. The display, camera, and battery life sucked. I was expecting a better device from Google than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I think that this is a very well engineered device but the only reason I am giving it 3 stars instead of 4 is because it lacks a usb charger. I purchased the usb cable and it does work, but its a pain in the neck because the usb port on my computer is right under the USB port on this product and the charger won't fit because it is on the same side as the USB input on the computer.  -Kevin  I had a previous iphone and had used my iphon with no problems. I was about to buy another iphono cartridge for my new iPhone.   The iphony was much better than the iphoniote. It's really small. ,  The iphonic is a great iphONE music player but it is really a bit bulky for my taste.  It will fit in your pocket when the phone case is on but it makes a bulky and not very convenient to carry around.  The sound quality of the ips is very good but the sound is quite distant in comparison to the ipi. There's a lot more bass on the ixp. I did like the ics so much because it's small and small headphones have always been a good thing for me. But in my opinion the ikea iphones are a much better choice. I recommend that you give this iphophone a try because it will save your money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I can't believe I'm saying this, but these are terrible products. I purchased an Apple iPad 2, and I must say that I really like this product. I do not care for how difficult the screen is to read when reading from a web page. I really wanted an iBook because it has a touchscreen, and if you are a student or are someone who needs a tablet, this is a great option. But if you want to just use it as a tablet on your computer, these aren't great. And the keyboard on the back is not very good. I would be happy with a $100 Apple device, but this will not last long and is far from worth the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this a couple of weeks ago, and have been using it every day for a week. It's very easy to use, and has held up to all my regular use. I've never been a fan of wireless earphones because I think they're really uncomfortable. I used to own and use the Sennheiser HD650, but it really wasn't an ideal fit. This fit better, but with all the issues I've had with this one, I'd recommend waiting a bit longer before you buy.

I really liked the ergonomics of the headset (i.e. the pads) and the sound, but I wanted to be able to play in the car, so I bought a different headset, which has been great.  It's got a slightly thicker feel to it, which really helps with my hearing loss in both ears and helps me avoid hearing loss.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I use my computer for two main things, but now it has to live in a closet and in the dark because of my stupid new keyboard!  -   I bought this about 2 years ago. This is one of the worst devices that I've ever purchased. It's so hard to type on, it is nearly impossible. The key switch itself, it's so flimsy. The plastic is really flimsy as well. If your looking to upgrade your computer, I would recommend to look elsewhere.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, March 07, 2011  Good Keyboard, Better Service  by A Customer from El Paso CA USA  Pros: Works very well Cons: No rubber feet to attach it to the stand and they don't last long  Review: I bought these keys to replace the cheap, crappy ones that came with my old laptop. They are much better than the cheap ones and they hold my keyboard quite well. I've never had to change my key layout to a computer keyboard before. I was concerned about the rubber feet, since they are cheap but good enough. They work quite well; they don's help your keyboard stand on its own when the computer is standing upright. I'm sure it wouldn't work as well standing on its side or lying on its back. I also like the fact that they don' work with my computer stand, since I've had to purchase the stand separately for mine.  that's a good keyboard. If it works like that.  "They are good enough"  By A Customer in United Kingdom from UK  This was my first computer keyboard and I was very happy with it. It was well made and felt sturdy, the only downside being that my old keyboard has been lost and now I have to buy a new one (which I'll be getting tomorrow). I was going to write a longer review on it because I thought it was fantastic but it wasn't that great. It wasn't the first keyboard to not have a rubber bottom but it definitely wasn't as good as the first one I bought and I now have the second one because they were so much cheaper!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A very basic and cheap device with the good thing is that it has a backlight which can be adjusted to a bright color.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What I really don't like about this product is that the micro USB port is connected to a connector that does not have the required polarity of "up" and "down". I used my phone several times to charge the phone and after that I used it to charge another device that had the "up-down" polarity. The "up/down" connection was very poor and in my experience, is the worst possible connector for charging. If you do not like using USB, then I do not recommend this product.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good product, bad usb-to-molex adapter So I ordered this, thinking it would be a great idea to have a 2.1 m cable with 3 USB plugs. The micro-usb connector on this product does not work. When I plugged in my phone the charger would not charge my phone. So I contacted Sennheiser, the manufacturer of the product. I called and asked about the usb-mallex adapter. The representative did say that the adapter had a molybdenum coating, so I was sure the moly was in there. I asked what the resistance of the mlex is and she said it is 1.6 Ohms, which is not a lot. So now I am left with a mle-usb-mle adapter that I cannot use, as it is not rated to mle. The unit will work with any mule-usb device, but it is very confusing. In the end, I am still happy with the product and can still use my old cable to charge my smartphone, but not with this new USB one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this because of the price but was disappointed because the unit has not been as stable or reliable as I would have hoped.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing that this product does is provide a nice display on an old cell phone screen. You can see and make calls by just turning the volume up, and pressing a button on the side to make it ring. The speaker is loud but only when the phone is on mute. A lot of apps like to talk while the phone runs so you will get some audio distortion when talking. I was hoping to get a larger display for my phone but I was disappointed. I can see that I can't put a good battery on this, but other people might like the way it looks. I am not going to return it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I think the keyboard is very difficult to type on and requires a lot of force, the touchpad is poor at best, the speakers are not very loud, the camera is mediocre at best. I got this because my previous one (which was almost 3x the price of this one) stopped working. After buying this, I am glad I did. The only thing I dislike is the lack of a SD card slot. It would be great if there was an SD card.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Tablet Great tablet. I am using it in a small office. It is easy to navigate the interface and the screen is great. Battery life is great for me. If you're looking for a portable device that can hold a bunch of documents or a book and run well, this is it.  is a great product that can fit into almost any job. It's a great laptop replacement as well, especially with its low price and excellent performance. , however, has the same screen resolution, as well as the same size, which makes it hard to use in one hand without slouching. It has the screen and keyboard, but the trackpad and keyboard are both inferior. I could not type on it in any meaningful way.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     No, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     "I bought this device to replace my old one that was leaking all kinds of electronic stuff. It works fine for that purpose, but then it leaks out of the socket when plugged into the computer. I went and replaced it with a much better device that actually charges the device, but that has some issues as well. I'm happy with my first unit, and I'll continue to buy these for the money. My only complaint is that my old device was the right size and looked like it was made by the same company. I'll look for something a little more "mechanical" next time. Hopefully this is not a big problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this thing about a month ago because it looked cool and the idea of having my phone on me without having to carry it with me seemed like a good idea. Well, not so much. The unit is the size of a laptop and the screen is tiny and poorly calibrated, so it's hard to see what is going on. It's very noisy with all the apps and notifications, and the battery life is mediocre. The speakers are subpar as well and the camera is terrible. My last purchase from Apple was a very cool and impressive unit from the past, and this one is even worse. I'll have to find another unit that can last a week.

Rated 1 out of 5 by James from Poor quality The product did not come with the screen protector and as it is an old design the back does not protect the screen. Also it has poor screen colors and there is no sound or vibration from the screen when pressing buttons. Also this is a phone to be used in a dark place for longer periods of time so there is not a lot of light.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing that struck me about the unit was how big and heavy it is. The first time I was able to hook it up, I had a hard time getting the power on as the unit does not have the standard power on button. I went to the back of the unit to see if there was any way to turn the unit on and found that the power button was a single button and could not be easily used. The other issue was the battery life. The battery life is not what I had hoped for. I was expecting 5-6 hours of continuous use and about 20-25 hours of usage. The unit seems to charge well. The only thing that would make it even better would be if I could make it charge over wifi.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this about 5 weeks ago and it's been fine till last night when i got a phone call from work (3 days ago) that the unit was broken. It had worked perfectly for years. Now it won't do any more then it did the night I bought it. I emailed support to ask for replacement and it was a few days later. The replacement came, but the first thing the service rep did is throw out the packaging and tell me "we can't fix the unit right now because it was in the recycling center and the only one that can take it is the one that threw it out"... I'm sorry I bought the E7 and you decided to trash it. My only suggestion is buy a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You have to ask the question if you have ever seen any one in a real setting using an iPad and say "yeah, I don't think so."   You might have noticed that my negative review is a bit harsh and I did not get to the bottom of the iPad's technical problems. I think this is the main reason why this product was so expensive:  The biggest reason why I can't recommend this product is the problem with the wifi. When I was testing it, the wifi connection was unreliable all the time. Sometimes, the device would just fall back to wireless. Other times it would freeze, not allow the device to connect to my wifi network.  Somehow, I'm not sure how this was not fixed before.   This has been going on for quite a while and no one has been able to help me. This has got to be some of the worst products I have ever purchased from the Apple store!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I can't believe it's that time again that I have to buy a computer again. This computer is very cool but it is very hard to work with and even my friends that are computer experts think I have no clue what I am doing. Also the screen is VERY small, the buttons on the keyboard are all small and I can't understand how anyone thought it was a good idea to make a computer that small. I also didn't like that I had to open up the case to take out the hard drive, I have a hard drive with a bigger hard drive in my desktop. I even had to turn the power off just to get the little screws out to unplug the hard drives. Also it was too big to be a notebook. My only other complaint is that there were no Bluetooth speakers or speakers at all when I was testing the computer. I mean there is a Bluetooth radio on there but I have never found a Bluetooth speakers for it or I would buy one for the computer but there is no one in the store that has any of those or at least a couple of them. I have been looking for a notebook computer and can't think of one but if anyone knows of one please let me know. I would give this 5 stars but the screen was just too small and not big enough to be any good and the keyboard is just too big and not wide enough. I really wish they would sell Bluetooth speakers that are smaller so people who like small laptops can actually use one of them!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It does not have the sensitivity that it says it has, and I have seen this happen to some reviewers.   I have had it in my hands for a week now and its still giving me trouble.  The buttons are really hard to press and they don't respond.  It is just a waste of my time, money, and frustration.    " This is a great product, but not for the price. "  I'm not trying to be a negative person, just honest about a purchase.  First, I was looking for a simple and inexpensive device that I could record live music, but didn't want to invest a lot of money to get one.  There are lots of quality options out there, but i wanted something I could use and enjoy. This is it, and it has served its purpose so far.  If it was more sensitive it would be perfect for live performances and recording.  I am very pleased with this purchase and will likely buy more.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have tried out many high end electronic devices such as the HP TouchPad, iPad, iPod Touch, Nexus One and I love them all, but this HP Touchpad is the worst. I have to use it on its side. I bought this to have a more comfortable typing experience. Well, this is not the case. It is way too small for me. The keyboard is not at all comfortable for me to type on. It takes longer than using a smaller tablet with a keyboard. I would rather use a small tablet such as my iPod touch. There are also no dedicated keys for navigation. The keys are placed to the left and right of the trackpad. I am very disappointed. I can type without getting irritated, but I can't use my tablet in any manner I want because the keys are not the right height to type comfortably. I could not be happier.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Mjw3 from I like the features...but the screen is just average This Touchpad has plenty of features, but the screen itself is mediocre, and the buttons and ports are hard to use.  that is just my opinion, but since it's a cheap device, I can tell its a step below a pro device.  of course it's cheap. I just got it for the touchpad as I don't use a big mouse. I do use a trackpad on my MacBook Air and a touchpad on a macbook. It's definitely a nice touchpad but the one on the Touchpad isn't as nice and is way to small. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been in the process of learning to do the basics like using a computer, having a home theater, and I have to say the Samsung TEE-300 is a great start! It is easy to use, easy to power, and comes with great accessories! The only negative about this device is it's price tag ($80), I know it is a lot to pay for a TEE, but I think that if you are going to get this device you need to make sure you are not a high-end consumer because you could be wasting a great deal of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device worked pretty well initially, however as I got more familiar with using it, it started failing constantly. The button to power it on and off had problems and the display and keyboard were constantly getting hot. A few times I tried to shut it down, it just kept going. The computer got very hot, too. I gave up on it in January and ordered a refurbished Asus VivoBook, which has replaced that model.   -    I am very disappointed. I could not get this product to work on my computer (Windows 7 64-bit) at all! I have contacted ASUS and will update with a response, but as of now, I am returning it.

Other than that, I can't beat it.  I'm not sure if i'm happy or sad. I bought the Nexus 6 and was in the middle of an intense summer. I took the Nexus out for a test drive on a recent trip. I went for a hike in the woods, and I needed a fast device that I could take with me to check the latest apps and read the latest news. I was extremely disappointed with my experience. I had just finished my hike and was sitting in a bus station waiting for my bus to come and get me when my Nexus 6 died. I could see the screen go out, but was told that Google's warranty would not cover this, and that it was their fault for using the wrong charger. Needless to say I was very upset. The next morning I put the Nexus to sleep and got a brand new one. I immediately plugged it into a charger, tried to connect the screen to the phone, and nothing. When I tried to charge the device the screen still wouldn't connect. I then tried to turn on the phone. It didn't work, and when I pulled the power cord out of the socket it was covered in dead pixels and a lot of dead battery. I finally realized that the USB port in the back of the phone doesn't work because it's the same connector used for charging. It took me a good 10-15 minutes of fiddling around before I finally got it to connect to a charger and get the screen back on. The thing is, I bought a Nexus 6 on sale a month ago for $300, and it still costs $100 over the price of the Nexus 5 I was used to getting from Google. It makes me wonder if I'm just being overcharged for a cheap device. I'm going to do some more research and see if there's anything that I can do about it, but it's pretty frustrating.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I was disappointed with my purchase of this device. It doesn't do anything that a traditional calculator does and it does not have a calculator app. There was no one I could contact to get help. It was difficult to get the thing working with only one power outlet. I bought this to make my homework easier, but this machine does not meet my expectations.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So it's a 3 year old Apple iBook. Now that iBook's out of warranty Apple won't offer any repair or replacement for it. So here i am trying to do a repair. It's a simple problem. When I start to turn it on my laptop locks up. When i press the sleep button nothing happens, when i do the screen is black. I also noticed that when i plug it into an adapter and it's plugged into a monitor. It will work fine and the screen goes black. But when i run it on the original Apple iMac it will only run in "portrait" mode. There is no way to change that. So i'm stuck with it as is. This is a great computer and an excellent portable device for school work, but when it gets into the repair department and the tech is not very impressed I'm not going to be very happy. If you buy this thing take it back before your battery dies and you won't have to be unhappy. If not you're going to regret buying this thing.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You get what you pay for.   I did get the "I don't know if it is bad but it's so hard to use" email when the laptop broke in a few days.  A cheap piece of junk.  I got the laptop for a Christmas gift but did not use it for about 2 months because I kept getting "my computer needs work" and "I have no more disk space" messages. After I got this thing I have had so many issues with it.  It is completely unresponsive when you try to get something done, the wifi is slow and unreliable, it can get so hot when you are doing heavy work and the screen is not even in good shape.  The only thing I will say is that the screen looks really good but not for a price tag of about $800.  And I don't like the size of this thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â If I had to choose just one issue with the Vibrant 3D printer, it is the size of the build platform. I would recommend a printer with a larger build platform, but the Vibant has a very limited build platform which is why I did not buy it.   In addition, I would have liked the option of using the included 3mm threaded rod to add the threaded rod on the build carriage. I don't know if this is the original design or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing is small and small compared to other things I have in my room. The first time I used the thing, it was broken and I broke my own arm using it so that you don't have to have a table to play with it.   In my opinion the thing is good for the price, and if you buy the $15 bundle with a stand it is even better, however I could never figure out how to make it work, and I ended up selling it for $20 because it's hard to use on the table.  Good Buy:  It's hard for me to say this is a "good buy" because the stand that comes with the thing looks like a cheap table to me.  But I would definately buy this thing again.

One of the few things I can complain about about my phone is the app in the color changing function that lets you switch the phone screen. It makes everything look washed out, makes text look fuzzy and almost as if it's made of paper. So frustrating.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very excited about the Apple iBook because the iPad was too expensive.   The iBook was a great device, but the battery drained very fast.  The screen wasn't good.  I couldn't use it in bed (the batteries were too weak) and it had a terrible trackpad.  It is a great tablet for watching videos and reading on the go.  My friends and I used it to watch videos of my family.  If they were more affordable they would be a good purchase.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dan from Best tablet ever I got this from the Apple Store in my neighborhood on sale. I'm so glad I did. It's so easy to use and the apps are amazing. I love it.  I bought this from my local Apple Store on sale because my iPad 2 was broken, so I couldn it to use to review my iPhone 6 Plus. I don't understand the people who complain about the build quality of the iBook. The iBOOK is light and thin and fits in my backpack. It has a solid feel to it and the keyboard is awesome. The trackpad is fine, but I can't say that it's better than the one on the iPad 2. It would be nice if the keyboard had a backlight, but for $199, I don the best thing I've ever spent on an eReader. I have been buying the Apple books from my friend's family for the last year and I am amazed at the quality of them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first saw the HP Z2, I was skeptical: Â HP was making a good product, but there were a lot of issues:  Â    I think it's one of the most well built devices I've ever used; it's very sturdy, and I've had no problems at all.   This is the same device as the HP Probook 9560 that I reviewed some time ago:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Cq6lqRxOw   However, I'm pretty pleased with the Z2:  It's better than my previous HP ProBook 9560  It has good battery life:  I'm used to my old ProBook, which is a 10 year old laptop, and the Z1 lasts for about 8 hours and 10 minutes.  A nice feature:  You can put it to sleep  It connects via wifi  I've only had it for a few days so I'm not sure if it will last.  I like the HP logo:  HP logo on the Z-Series laptop:  The HP Z-7 has better battery life and looks better.  It can connect via wifi:  Like the HP 9560, it can connect to an   wireless network, but like the 9560 you need an 802.11 a/b/g router.  Like any other wireless network with the help of an external router, it is possible that you may not be able to connect to the network.  With the help  of an internal USB drive, I have been able to transfer my files to my Z2.  Unfortunately, I don't know yet whether the HP wireless keyboard that the Z7 uses will work:  This seems to be the problem, and not the keyboard itself.  However I've been able  to connect via wireless.  The keyboard feels very good:  When I put it on, it felt very nice.  This was not a problem with the 9570, which has a rubber-coated keyboard.  HP offers a "special" edition of the Z series:  There is the 9540, a smaller version of the 9565, a Z-81L, and a Z2L. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is a great starter kit.   We were searching for something similar to the popular 'Starter Kit: EOS 70D', and these are really cool.  This is a must have for anyone who wants to start with a camera, and is not interested in the more complex EOS EOS 5D III.  It is light-years ahead of the EOS 7D.  The only thing i don't like is the button. It's a bit stiff, and i would like to see a little bit of give to it.  It is worth the money.  Â  This was the second camera I got from them.  One was broken before the others.  I'll be ordering the others for my next EOS.  Ease of Use: Â It's a pretty easy camera to use.  You just hold the button for a few seconds, and it locks the shutter.  Also, to make sure you are getting the right film, there are three rings on the top of the camera.  To make sure there are no stray chemicals, it takes you to the film spool.  Overall:  A great first camera that will get you used to using cameras.  There are a few issues.  1.  Is the screen big enough?  I'm 6'0, and I'm not sure it's enough.  2.  My battery has a low life.  3.  No AF.  If you like the E3 and want a more basic camera with the E4 and EOS 60D's features, this is a good choice.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â I've always hated using my iPad mini because of the horrible touch screen.   This device is the same as the iPad mini 2 so that is not a good thing.  I am very excited about the iPad Pro and it will only get better with time.  The battery life is amazing and I use it mostly as a media consumption device.  It will be difficult for anyone to beat the iPhone 7.  It is very similar to the original iPad but the new form factor is definitely nicer to hold. Â However, my biggest issue with the new iPhones is that they don't come with the same type of leather back as the one found on my first iPad 2.  Also, some of the designs seem out of date compared to the iPad 2 and it's hard to get the screen onto the back without a lot of fiddling.  My favorite feature about the iPhone is the camera.  For anyone wondering, it is definitely a huge upgrade over the iPad.  In fact, I can't think of a better camera and the flash is so cool.  As far as apps go, there are a lot more now than there was a few years ago.  There are a ton of apps and that's great.  Unfortunately, the new iPad doesn't have enough apps and I can still see the same lack of apps that I used to see in the 7 Plus.  While I do love how easy it is to scroll through a webpage, it can be frustrating because I still have to remember which page I'm on and that makes the web browsing a little difficult.  One other thing that I found odd with the iPhone 6 Plus is that it doesn't look as nice as the 7. Â  It's still a great looking device though.  Overall, it's still better than the 7 or 8 because the new software is better, the cameras are better and the screens are better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My last one lasted only a few weeks. It was too large and flimsy.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Kels from Not good at all. We bought a very expensive unit at the last minute. I did not know much about digital cameras but the box said it was very high quality, and they were really excited about it. We thought it was a great deal, I mean it is a nice camera. We had it for a month and it did not work properly. The camera was giving an incorrect exposure every time we pressed the button. We decided to return it but they would not take it back. We sent it back but it was too late and they would do nothing to help. The company I called tried to say that it was not the camera but I said it is the brand and model name I did remember from the box. The picture is all off. There is no way it works at all because they did not follow the instructions. They have no way to get it fixed. We now have a bad camera. I am a camera junkie. I have a Nikon D700, a Sony a6000, and a Panasonic Lumix GH4 (a great camera) and a couple of Canon cameras. I'm not so good with electronics. I've never owned an electronic camera before. I also have never taken a camera apart and had it work. So I really had no idea what was going on. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (for the Samsung Galaxy S4)   The phone is very simple to use, but not at all intuitive. The phone itself looks good, but it is hard to find a place in my pocket for it.   I had to wear headphones to get it to work on my car, and then my earbuds fell out.     My friends have also commented that they are glad to have an iPhone instead of the Galaxy S.  I know I could have easily purchased a Samsung, but I chose to wait for a new phone to come out so I can go with the latest and greatest. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The following is an example of one of the bad things you will get out of your new iPhone 5: Â I think I've gotten better at this kind of thing since the first iPhone, but my new phone is very annoying. There is a small vibration which seems to pulse every few minutes. This happens when I turn the device off and on again. Â When it pulses the screen is still on but when it stops it's not, and I don't understand why it's pulsing.   I have looked through the Apple App Store for alternatives and none come close to the new iPhone.  I've read of other people complaining about this and some say that a similar noise is what's supposed to happen when they power on a newer iPhone 5 (which I doubt as it's very clearly not the case).   It's not like this is a new feature or something Apple should have added.  I donï¿½t think it's as annoying as I had hoped and I'd much rather just be able to turn the screen off and not have to put it in a case.  The iPhone 5 is extremely well built and looks very sharp and beautiful, but there are clearly a lot of bugs still in the software. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My Samsung Galaxy S5 came with some kind of "battery adapter" which is a screw-on rubber cup that you screw onto the outside of your device. It allows you to extend your battery life for up to 2 extra days with the battery already charged. I have to say that I have not noticed a big difference in battery life from my original battery pack but the device still gets a good day out of me. I would definitely not recommend using a battery adapter on an item of this price range    Would recommend:  Not I do a lot of reading and I like to take notes when I'm on the go and I use to like using a smart phone for note taking and quick notes. When my iphone died I did a lot research and found that the iphones only problem was not having enough power. So I started looking for a new phone but was not satisfied with the ics. When I found this phone it was cheaper than iphona  It had a longer battery life than ics  It was also a better quality  I bought a iphon with a lot more memory and a larger screen so i had a backup  I had the ios 6, it worked great for the most part, I got my phone 2 years ago and I decided to upgrade because of its power. The problem is that the ios 6 was not made for the iPhone 5 or the larger 5s and 4  At the price point I chose it because I wanted a backup phone, but it's not for me.  I wish Apple would add more battery options and keep charging the battery in a charger. The phone has a great battery life, but after a couple weeks of use it started running very hot and I ended up buying another iphoron with even more memory

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am a beginner in electronic design. I have purchased a number of computer monitors and video cards, and most of them have worked pretty well. However, I found that the video card that came with my computer was not up to the task of running my graphics card. After some experimentation I found a way to change the video and audio card drivers on my computer, and the computer now runs at the highest resolution possible. I can run all my games without any problem on this computer. So why did I buy this product? Because I have been searching for a monitor that will run the computer, graphics card, sound card and operating system at a high resolution without the need to turn up the volume or adjust the colors on the monitor, all of which are the typical adjustments people make with video and sound equipment. I am happy to report that this monitor does just that. My graphics card no longer fails to recognize my card and I have not had to turn the sound up, or adjust color. It is clear that this video card is a lot more than the sum of its parts. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who desires an easy high resolution monitor that does not need to be set to high for gaming.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      As the first thing you think of when you hear about a wireless headphone that you think is great, the Sony MDR-7506 does not disappoint. The sound is pretty nice for this type of headphone. It's not very warm but it isn't especially recessed either, which can be a bad thing in some headphones. If you can find a nice pair of cans that have a similar sound signature (but that don't have the bass response of a good pair of headphones), this is probably a good choice for you. However, since I do not own a pair of Sennheiser or AKG I'm not really sure if the sound can really match up to those cans. I have to say, while I think they are pretty good, the treble is just a little too sharp for me, especially with a good sounding set of cans like the Senns. I'm a bit disappointed in this because my Senn is better sounding overall than this. It also suffers from a very slight treble blip (more noticeable when the headphones are set on a low volume).   The cable on the MDR is fairly stiff, which is nice if you want to play it hard. The only time I thought it was not as strong was when I played the music from the iPod and the soundstage became very tight, which isn't something I have seen often. The MDR sounds excellent for the price (if you're not thinking about buying the SONY or AKGs), and for that I can't fault the Mdr-7508 at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this after searching for a "good" compact flashlight with an LCD screen and the output of a "bright" output for under $100. I was not disappointed. The battery life is great and the size is great for a day pack. However, the charging system is a little finicky and the charging cable (provided) is not long enough for my usage. That said, it is more than a compact flashlight. I find myself using this light daily, and I am very pleased with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a pretty good unit, and there's a ton of fun features. But the sound and display are both lousy. When I got the unit I was disappointed to see the battery indicator, but I'm glad to report it's actually working after all that time and it's still easy to change the batteries.    The unit works and is pretty cool, but the display and the battery life are... Well, that's a huge disappointment.  This is an older model. I bought a newer model that I think would be more suited to a younger audience.  For the price, I would have expected something a bit more impressive, or at least better in terms of sound. I don't remember the last time I got an audio unit that was "okay" in that area. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Rated 5 out of 5   If you don't want a phone or tablet, a tablet is a godsend and definitely worth the extra money. If you buy a phone, you can probably live without the keyboard. But the iPad mini is great and the keyboard is very nice. The screen isn't the best on a tablet but it gets the job done and the battery life is great. The new iPad is also easier to work on than previous ones and that makes it easier to read a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I like this unit so far. The software is easy to use, but if you want to know what is being done, you must type in the commands. For example, when the unit is powered up, the display reads 'Powering Up'. To turn it off, you simply press the power button. There are other issues that I will mention here in a later review but for now I am satisfied and would recommend this unit to anyone who needs a portable electronic that can keep up with you. I do have one minor gripe with the unit, that I thought I might mention: the unit's remote control is very light. The unit is rated at 10 watts, but is very sensitive to the resistance of the wire connecting the device to the remote control. When I'm wearing a heavy belt, my hand, the remote and my device all become very warm. I think this is because the weight of the remote controls is not distributed well across the unit. If you want a heavy-duty device that can stay in your pocket, go with a unit with a larger remote.

The cord does not have the same long and thin feel that the original unit has, but it is just fine for power as well as connection to other USB devices.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had a couple of cheap phones. I had been looking for a phone that would be just as reliable as the LG/Huawei and Motorola, but at a much lower cost. The HTC 8X and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 were fine phones, but they needed to be upgraded from their previous generation in order to be up to par with the rest of the phones in the current generation. After two months of using the HTC 8P (a pre-release model) the battery is running very low, the screen is not as good as the Note 3, the battery life is sub par, the build quality is poor and the software is not up to the standards of other phones in this price range. When I was able to obtain a review unit I bought the iPhone 4S which I have been very happy with. I would not have purchased this phone had I not been given a review copy. HTC is better than Samsung, but I would never buy an HTC phone again due to the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I have to say about the Meegoo G2 was that I didn't really get it, the sound quality is really poor. I have a pair of Audio Technica's and the difference in sound is huge. In comparison to the Bose and Meego, the Meboo GX is a step down. Also the speaker volume on the G2 is not great. The GX I was given has 2x the volume but the sound is pretty muffled and the quality is less than the B2 and Mecgoo. I wish I had just purchased a Bose/Mecgoot, as I really enjoy my Meeboo and don't miss the sound.    Excellent portable Bluetooth speaker:  The Meeboo G-2 is an excellent product. I'm surprised to find that it has very high volume output. It doesn't take long to get used to and it is very comfortable for long listening sessions. A big benefit is that the G-1 does not require batteries. It will last a very long time. The battery life is good, although some have reported a drop in output when they use them on low-power mode. The Bluetooth range is good. The only negative aspect of the G1 is that some people report a little buzzing at the top of the device when the Bluetooth connection is being established. This may be due to the fact that the Bluetooth dongle is connected to the Meco hub. I did not experience this buzzing when the device was on the charging cradle that the Meesho comes with.

The cables came a little quickly, but they're the best I've tried so far. Not much to say about it. I have two of these so far: one is working fine, and the other has been running for weeks now. I'm not sure if this would be the one that would be a problem. I haven't noticed any difference between the two in terms of quality of audio, though the one I have working doesn't have the headphone out, only a microphone, so I don't know how it compares to my other one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - This product doesn't work. It only works if I push the buttons in the wrong way. If I do so, the screen doesn't turn on.   - This product has no display. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As a consumer, I am always looking for a good deal on something.   I had this device for two weeks now.  When I purchased the device, I thought I got a good value.  The only thing I did not like was that the screen was not touch-sensitive.  But the other 2 days with it was good and all the features are good!  I like this device and I would recommend it to others.  I'm a big fan of the "Smart" features like GPS, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS for navigation.  For the price, it is a good choice.  One small complaint is that the charging ports are on the side and hard to reach.  Overall, I like it and will continue to use it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the EHX MicroBrute from Amazon after reading the reviews. I didn't expect it to sound great, but the price was pretty reasonable. Unfortunately, I'm still not convinced by what I'm hearing. The first time I plugged it in, it hummed like crazy and sounded bad. I plugged into my computer, and then plugged it into my power supply (I have a 24V/60Hz power supply), and it still hummed. This was after I had the thing plugged in for 5 hours with no problems. Also, once you get into the lower treble, it really makes a dull sound. I have a good quality audio/mixing computer, so I'm sure the sound is there, but it's not great. The MicroBrutes were made of plastic, so it was a very unpleasant experience. I don't like spending money on anything that won't sound great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had my new iPod Nano since Dec. 2012. I was really excited for it at the time since it was a high quality product with better features than other "Nanos." It is now almost a year later and it's still a pain to use. The sound quality is terrible and the battery life is only about 2 days. The buttons are not responsive and it is difficult to get them to work with the new operating system. The only good thing about this device is that it has the best selection of music for the price range.   I was really pleased with the build quality and music player. I just wish it would have lasted more than 2 years.  When I bought the Nano, I had been hearing a lot about the quality. I didn't think it would be the same as my iPod Nano, but it's been even worse than that. I love my iPad, so I wasn't sure if this would be any better. Unfortunately it isn't. It is not a high end device by any means, but I've been using mine almost exclusively for over a year now and it hasn't held a candle to the iPod Nano. When the battery dies, it will usually take over an hour to recharge, and the speaker is barely audible. The volume is very poor and the song selection sucks. I wouldn't buy this device again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPhone 5 is an awesome device.   When you want a phone that's going to be perfect, the 5 is a great phone.  The only issue I had with the phone was that you cant use it to take photos with a mirror and the screen doesn't turn on.  But, I still love my   and would recommend it to anyone that wants an   device that   is built like a tank  .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â    My review:  At first glance the box has no special features other than the label. There are no accessories except the case and charger that come with the unit. The case is rather big and fits the phone rather snug. It also has a hard plastic outer layer that is similar to the iPhone 6 Plus. The inside is more like a case for a phone with a screen and an external USB charging port and a headphone jack. The outside is the same hard plastic that you get with other phones in the iPhone line. It is easy to install the case. Once it is on the phone feels like it has no problems fitting in the case at all. Once installed it is a bit difficult to remove from the phone once the phone is set up. I'm sure that if you were to take the phone apart a little, you could get the case off pretty easily. I also noticed that the phone can only be charged through the headphone jack on the side of the phone. The battery is the power source and this is a good thing because it means you need to use the headphones and a micro-usb cable to power the phone for the full 5 hours of use.Â  The only problem with this phone is the fact that you can only charge it through the headphones jack on this phone which is really frustrating because the headphone cable will not fit into the ear holes so you can't use the earphones. This is the case for many of these phones and I really wish that Apple would make a headphone adapter so that you could use the Apple Earbuds with this device. The microphone is fine but it is not as good as the iPhone 5s. If you were a Mac user you might be able to use this phone for other reasons other than music, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. There aren't many other phone features like this on the market so it's really disappointing that the iPhone can't be used in a larger capacity for a larger price.Â  I would highly recommend that you check out the website where it was found and make sure you get the right case for this device before purchasing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This unit is not very loud. When using this unit with a subwoofer system it is loud enough to make a good subwoofers sound very tinny. Not much of a sub for that price. If you are looking for a sub that can handle subwowoofer volumes and will not break the bank, this unit may be right for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What a waste of money. It took forever to put in the correct batteries and only charged when needed (which was rarely). This thing is a piece of crap, I have had many problems with this electronic device in the past, and this is the best example of why they are a waste.   Rated 4 out of 5 by JT from Good little device, easy to use. Great price for a good quality product. Easy to get on/off. No hassle, and it fits nicely into my shirt pocket. Easy start. I am just starting out in photography so I use it mainly as an alternative to my digital camera. It was very easy to set up and uses the same batteries. It can also be used as a motion sensor. Not sure how accurate the range is but it works well enough. This is the first thing I have bought from B&H and I've purchased some from other vendors but this one is a keeper.  One word of advice: Use a flashlight. It's easy to lose the battery when using the light function.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So if you have a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone and you are looking at the new Samsung Galaxy Gear watch, you may want to look somewhere else. This is a new style and design of watch and it is a disappointment. I don't see why they are selling it for so much money. I'm giving this watch a 1 Star Rating because the time display is very slow, if not non existent. If the screen were to flash it would make the device much better. If you are going to use this watch the way it is supposed to be used then buy a Garmin that can take advantage of the watch's features. I would like to see a newer watch with better battery life.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "I used this thing for an hour. It was a pain to adjust so I just turned it off." "I can't believe I have to pay $250.00 for the same thing that I bought at Best Buy for 1/4th the price."   I am a small business owner who has a lot of gadgets. I have owned many other electronic devices. I don't recommend the TAC Pro. I used it for an hr. It wasn't fun. It turned on so slowly and when it would work at all it would turn off and back on, like some random switch. I wish this was a 3 year warranty. I'm so thankful I didn't try this thing. It is not worth the money.   You get what you pay for. I am an Apple fanatic. I own almost every Apple device. I like their products but this is a cheap little thing that just didn't do what I expected it to.  Â You get what the money is worth. Here are some additional features I would've liked: 1. The buttons work as well as a button in the iPhone or iPod. I find the buttons on this device are too small, and it's just a matter of the buttons being small enough to activate without having to lift them off of the device. It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the buttons were just big enough to use but I don' t like using my finger to press them. 2. The TAC PRO has a microphone, which is nice. 3. The display of the TACTPRO works and looks good. The color of the display is great. 4. There is a button on the front of the unit that allows you to plug in a USB extension cord. This helps me as it allows me to use the Tacticpro on the computer.  I bought the Tact Pro as a portable charger.  It is nice to have a rechargeable battery.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase and I would recommend this unit.  If you buy this thing you will be getting something in return. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a Samsung F200 (S6) that had a terrible habit of dying on me. After reading countless reviews and articles online I decided to buy the F700 (S9) but it didn't live up to its expectations, at all. I got the F100 and I have been happy with it for many years now. It is fast, accurate, and has a great user interface. It's no secret that my main device for my personal work is my Samsung F700, so I wanted the same for my gaming rig. The F700 has never let me down yet, and its the best thing I've used for years! Now, the S9 has a good camera but I can't see myself using this for gaming. I do need to be in a place with a good wifi connection and at least 8 GB of ram for it to be useable, but if I'm going to have this over a laptop I'd get the S7 first.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first purchased my Nexus, I had high hopes. This device is not the best phone I've ever used, but it's a good phone for the price. The Nexus has great battery life, and I've managed to get about 10-12 hours out of it (which is far above what I would have expected from any Android phone). However, I still have yet to see a full 1080p display, and that's something that really sucks. The 1080p screen on the iPhone 6 Plus is fantastic for viewing videos and playing games. But if I want to watch videos on my Nexus (with the exception of Youtube), I have to wait a few minutes for them to download to my phone before I can actually see the video (that is, if I don't watch the video in another application). I'm disappointed, because this isn't the worst thing about this phone; it's just disappointing. I'm sure I can find a solution for this, but for a first device from Google, I'm really expecting more.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:       My main gripes about my   I   are a)   to have a remote to control my television (which is a good idea), but for it to only work on some of the TVs, not others. B) Â the cable coming out of the box is too short, so I needed to go pick up a long one for my cable box to use. C)  Â  the touch screen is very small and hard to see and use. D)  To have to replace the hard drive after just a couple months is too much, but at least the remote works.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     5) The display is beautiful. No pixel peeping or flashing, and crisp and colorful on black backgrounds. Very good looking.   The display was a bonus. There is a slight lag in the menu as the phone's power button doesn't respond right away. This is a real bugbear for some who are used to a responsive and quick Android device. It's not a problem for me.  When using an Android device, you never have to pause to check the time. It is quick to launch. If you don't have a USB-C cable, you can use the USB-A port to plug it into a PC.  I'm a power user and this phone is perfect for that.  The camera takes beautiful photos. I find the photo quality amazing. It takes good-enough photos, but with a very slight improvement in low light.  This phone is a dream to use. It has more power than the iPhone 7 Plus, but without the iPhone's fingerprint scanner. It also has a headphone jack and a headphone adapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the first portable speaker I've owned (and my first with the Bose design) and the setup (it's small but I guess it could be even smaller) isn't that great. When I plugged it in and played the audio from my iPhone (which was just sitting on my desk on the side of my computer) it sounded really bad, and the "bass" is actually pretty weak. The sound from the iPod is so much better. And there is some minor clipping which is annoying, but that might be from the computer itself. It's not a bad product in general, but the volume is just really bad and I can't believe it's supposed to be portable. I don't have the money for a better portable speaker, but I'm considering getting a second one (maybe a second model) and getting a headphone amp.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone did work well for the price, but the speakers were not high-quality. It is not easy to listen to music and use other apps on the device. This was only my second phone, and I plan to get an iPhone 6, so I was not really sure what to expect. I have heard a few good things about the quality of the iPhone 6 and I can't wait to get it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's a horrible device. For those who are not familiar with this, you have a tiny, ugly box that has a tiny screen with a tiny amount of resolution. It also has an annoying "micro-SD" slot. It doesn't even do 4G with the Verizon plan. But it does have "Smart-Charging" which is basically a mini-USB charging port. It can charge any type of device up to 3x faster than the original Apple charger. But unfortunately that's the only good thing about this device. It is terrible at wireless charging. It charges, it's fine, it charges, but you have to plug in the phone and charge it while you sit at your desk for over an hour. Even with its Smart-Charger technology it's still about as fast as my old iPhone. It's also not the smallest or cheapest of any of the chargers I have tested.   Posted by Paul at 3:20 PM
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I would buy again only if the warranty was longer. The cord is too short for my needs.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took some time to get used to the keys (the "f" key has a nice weight), but the rest of the keys are great. I love that it only has 2 slots for keys, one for the Fn key, the other for the space bar and number pad (I use a Fn key as my Windows key). I've tried other full size keyboards, and this one is definitely a keeper.  Review of DJ TechTools K5e USB Wireless Keyboard: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It did not work right out of the box.   The LED is not on all the time and when it is it is very faint.  The phone would not register that the battery was low.  No one had a problem with it.  When it came time to install the screen protector, it was too loose and the phone wouldn't turn on.  It also did not have any sort of adhesive and would fall off when pushed and twisted.  I have had my eye on these for a couple months and I am so happy with the price. I also love how the box is different in color.  My only issue is the lack of any sort on the side of the phone that allows you to remove the battery. It just looks like a hole that is supposed to be there but it is missing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It does not have all the features it is advertised with and the features can be difficult to find when you are looking at the "list of features".   At first, it has nice features, but the "unboxing and testing" process was very time consuming.   For me, it was not worth it.    I recommend purchasing a charger that is similar to this one, with the "Smart" feature that allows the USB cord to detect and shut off the computer when the computer is not plugged in, thus preventing the battery from draining.  I like the "Energy Saving" feature but it was very expensive and required a power cord and a power adapter.  If you buy a new laptop this is a good time to buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is amazing. I am so impressed with the quality of the materials. It fits my iPod perfectly. I'm about 6'4" and the 6" one fits like it's my second iPod. I can only say that I'm glad I bought it!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this with the "newegg" discount on 4/14. I bought the mouse on 9/20 and received it on 4 days later. The mouse works fine. The button placement is fine. It doesn't wobble at all. The scroll wheel feels good and is precise. The only negative is the mouse button is extremely sticky and it's easy to accidentally press it. If you like to be in control of your devices and not just a bystander, I give it 4 stars. If your mouse is easy to click and the scroll wheel is good, the mouse only needs 1 star. If the clicky button gets stuck at the end of your turn, the user interface is good for beginners.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This one has some bugs that I found, but I think they were isolated to the computer and not the whole unit. I was looking for a simple keyboard that worked with any computer. It came very well packaged and everything was packaged nicely. I like how the keyboard comes with both a mini-DIN connector and an RJ-11 jack so you can use it with any cable you want.   I would give this 5 stars if they would fix the USB ports, which are not functioning (or are just unusable)    Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from Good product! It works great with a Mac.  I am a Mac user, I can use this with my mac just fine.  Posted on April 4, 2017, 2:35 pm

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â Worthless for $200.   It didn't work. Â I never used this thing.  It had a problem with the screen getting stuck on a particular setting and I had to reset it to fix it.  This review is of my Samsung Samsung Galaxy S5   I bought this phone because of all the positive reviews. It's a nice phone, but not for my needs. I like having the screen up all the time but I can't see anything past about 10/12 feet. The camera and the audio are not great either.  I'm really sad to say goodbye to my trusty phone and this phone just made it so much worse.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device because it was cheap, but it was horrible to use and never stayed connected to my home Wi-Fi. It only allowed me to use Wi-fi at home and not much else. The only positive that I can think of is that it connects to my smart phone with a little bit of effort, but that is a big deal in the US (in my opinion) to have a home hotspot so it doesn't matter if the Wi-FI signal drops.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works great, it has a wide range of uses, it's simple and it's powerful, it comes with a case that is easy to open. However, when you need to turn it off, the handle gets caught in the charging cradle, which makes it difficult to shut off.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these with great expectations. They worked fine, but they are too flimsy. I have had two in a year and they are still flimsy, the spring in one was too hard, so I used an old spring to fix it. I had to go buy a spring because I can't fix this on my own. It would be nice if they included a second spring in a set. I guess it's ok as a replacement, but I can just replace them with my own spring.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm not a big fan of these.   They look good but sound bad.  If they were good I would probably have given them 5 stars.  The plastic feels cheap and the touch screen is extremely sensitive and has a bad "clicky" feel.  It doesn't even work as a touchscreen.  These don't have a power button or a way to turn the device on and off.  This means you can't charge them.  After turning the power on I would need to use a cable that plugs into a wall outlet to charge them and after charging them up the touch pad would freeze on my screen and wouldn't do anything.  I'd recommend this to a friend who likes to use his iPad and can only use his stylus.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tom from I've bought 2 of them (so far). Both are excellent. I've used them on my iPad Pro (2nd gen). They're a great solution to the large size of the 9.7" iPad Pro. When I first got the 9, the pen is not very good. So I got the 8 and I've been very happy with it. The touch sensitivity is fantastic. The screen on the 9 is smaller, and the pen (pencil) is not as useful. I use the 9 so often and the small size of it makes it less than ideal. The 8 is great for taking notes in the kitchen, on trips, etc. When it's nice out, I use it for taking pictures and drawing, but also to draw in my journal. If your a visual learner like me, you'll love this pen. My iPad Pro is a great pen. If it was bigger, I'd get it. But I'm happy with this, and I'm definitely getting more of these as a spare.  a must have for anyone who does anything digital. I'm using it with my iPhone 7 Plus as a digital sketch pad. My older iPad Mini is the computer I use most when doing anything digital like painting or drawing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm really disappointed with the sound quality on the earphones.  The earphones have good bass and they are definitely warm but not a whole lot of depth, they sound very flat. I bought the 5.1 to have something a little more "hip" to match my new Beats earphones that have a little better bass but for the money I expect more.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You may be the only one who really has a problem.   If you're buying a device on your own and don't want to break the bank, and don the latest in tech, buy it on amazon.   Don't waste your money buying this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem with most of the products that I have reviewed for this site is that they are not what they seem to be. They are good products at first, but then are not.  Â This product is no exception to this rule. Â While I love my first Vibra-Q.5 headphones, they are still a bit too quiet in some situations, especially if I'm out in the wind or in the shower with a lot of wind noise.  The earphones also produce a lot more noise than I prefer.  It has become so quiet that I feel as if my wife is reading my mind!  However, they are worth the money, especially because they come with a 2 year warranty.  They're also super comfortable.  If I want to get up in the morning and have some breakfast without worrying about my noise cancelling headphones, these are my headphones to have.  Check out the Vibralight. 5.4/10.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace my old Mac mini and thought it was perfect, then my laptop was stolen and my old one went with it.   So when i bought this i was not sure if i would like it, it's small and easy to carry but had many problems: the hard drive wont charge properly.  My old mac mini would not boot on the first try and this one was fine until i used it on a new mac pro, the new one worked fine.  It also has no internal speakers which are useless when i use this on the go.  And it only has two USB ports for connecting to my ipad and laptop and this is no problem, but it doesn't have an ethernet port for connecting with my home computer so when i plug the ethernet in it won't work, but the one port will work fine. But the one bad thing about this is that it does not have a bluetooth or wired wifi, i would have been better with a more expensive one, but i do like it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery charge indicator light is dim and unreliable; it seems to light when the device is charging, but the light does not blink when the battery is completely depleted. The charging light on this is too small to see. The LED lights at the top of the device are a red/yellow LED, which seems to be the only color that works. The device is fairly sensitive to vibration. The microUSB port is difficult to access. I'd recommend this to a friend who needs a tiny USB battery.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Chris from Not all is lost, yet. This is a fairly easy device to use. The thing is, the cable is so short that it can not hold a charge. In one year, I am still waiting for a replacement battery, as the replacement is also still not available. With this device, I will still be able to use my phone. However, I find myself using a laptop, and then plugging in this for occasional calls, as it will last me for another year. The only benefit is that this provides you with enough power to operate your smartphone, so you don't have to buy a replacement. But the small size is still a bit too small for my usage. I also have an ipad mini, so I prefer the size. I do however have a small desktop computer which I do not like the size of the ipad. Also, the price seems a bit higher than other models I've seen. I do hope for a better solution in the future. The only negative is I had to return the item for a refund. I will have to consider a return for a different device, but this was a big disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What really bothered me with this device is that it is designed in such a way that it's almost impossible to replace the battery in the device. I have three LG Optimus 4X HD and the second one (which was bought from a local retailer) was damaged because it failed to have the "memory card tray" mechanism for the battery. The battery also didn't hold a charge for nearly two years because it was too large to fit under the screen. You're also limited by the internal battery size.   I do like that the device comes with a 2-year warranty, but I feel like LG would have been better off offering a slightly larger battery that could hold a little more charge without the need for a larger charger.  This device is great for the price, but just remember to buy a new battery every six months or so!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm the original owner of this device and its not worth a penny anymore. It's an expensive piece of crap. The screen seems to have just been made by an assembly line and it was just cheap. I've had other products in the past and have always been satisfied, but not this one. I bought it because it was on sale at my local Radio Shack. However, that particular purchase went down the toilet. There's a whole bunch of bugs, like the touch screen is stuck to the LCD and doesn't turn off. If you have this in your kitchen, do not buy it. And if you do buy it, don't go back to the store. Buy it elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am not happy with this product. The button seems to have problems to start it up and it takes about 20 minutes to charge. If you are a person who uses this device a lot, you might not have a problem with this. But for the average person who does not use this all day, it might be more for you.  Excellent price for a good product:  Â  I bought this about 2 years ago for a trip to China. I've used this product several times now and have no complaints about it whatsoever. It charges quickly and is a good value for the price. It can also be used to charge other batteries in the same way as the standard Samsung charger, which is great. I also highly recommend the USB wall adapter that comes with it. It allows the device to work as a standard USB charger.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A big problem with the T-Mobile Galaxy S4 was that its micro-USB port is bad. Â It's too short for fast charging and too narrow to provide reliable power for cables like the USB-C to USB-B adapter, which you will be using.   After several days of testing, it's still too short.  You can find this device at Best Buy for $99.  I don't understand why Samsung, LG, HTC, Asus, Motorola, and others are giving us a new, better version of the same old USB-A port that's not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I like this little device!   I like this device! I have two!  You have got a winner!  My wife has one of these!  The batteries last for days!  I have the small one and it gives her back her mobility and she uses it a lot.  I was hesitant at first because it looks different but I was wrong.  I do have a recommendation. I like the idea of this and I do think this will be a good idea. The batteries are cheap and cheap is bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There is nothing good about this device and for $150 (plus $15 shipping) I would not recommend anyone.   The sound quality is very bad.  The phone does not have a screen which is a shame because its screen is so nice looking and the phone is much nicer than the cheap plastic phones the manufacturer is using.  I wish they used a more expensive material.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a fantastic tool. Very nice and compact, works well. I would have liked to see some sort of power cord included, but I do get the message that the USB ports on the back are the right ones to use. The only reason for not buying the wireless version is that you can't just plug it into the wall, like a laptop.   I would recommend this product:  I have two of these. One is used for recording voice memos. The other is used on the go. The first one was just a little too big for my purposes and was easy to put into my bag. With the wireless versions, it's great to be able to get it out and about and not worry about carrying around a big box of stuff.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a good electronic device for a good price. I got it from a local store because my old one broke and my son was getting married. He loved the device and didn't have to buy a new one. He was really pleased with it. The device works great. I wish it had some additional features like an on screen display and a battery life meter. I use this to play MP3s and videos in my computer and TV in my bedroom at night. It works great in the computer room. It's a nice size and fits my needs. It doesn't drain the battery, so I can easily put it down after a few hours of work or reading. I've used it about five times and it has only been slightly used in the five hours that I've been using it, but it seems to work flawlessly. It is the perfect size for my small hand. My son is getting married in three days and I'm excited to show him how awesome this thing is!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is one of those things that were great in theory, but unfortunately failed in practice.   I have the first generation of this device, and it just wouldn't turn on properly after I had connected it to my home network.  It would show up on my network as a "wired" device (it was wired) but couldn't be remotely controlled from my house, and even if I did, the software would keep trying to connect to it.  So I had to physically remove the battery from my computer and plug it into the device, then connect it back to my computer.  The device then would start up, but would also be a "net" device, so I would have to get the router to "wake" it up, since it was already connected to my network. Â  The router is a $40 router with a bad chip, which made the device useless for remote control.  All of the problems with this unit are the same as with all wireless routers:  - Bad design - Bad chip - Bad software - No ability to connect it to a computer (or anywhere else on the network) - No battery - No OS updates The router that comes with this device is an expensive $35 router, but it is supposed to work with "wireless" devices.  While the device's software seems to work well, the hardware itself is very basic and is very easy to beat up (especially the battery).  In my case, I used a piece of PVC pipe with a length of electrical conduit to create a "U" shape for the device to plug into.  To this point, I have spent about $70 total on a total of 3 devices to attempt to do something remotely remotely controlling them:

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's a very simple device and as a result, I'm finding it harder and harder to return it.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Lola from Works as intended I bought this for my new computer because I needed a portable power source.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just recently bought a   Sony X-T1 from BestBuy and it's   broken. I have to go to the Best Buy and buy a new one.   It's like they just gave the bad product to BestBuy.  My X-Pro 1 is broken too. I just love Sony cameras.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Outstanding camera for the price I have a Sony A7 and a SSC-100 for weddings and I love using the SSC cameras for a quick photo at the event. I am using the X-t1 for our latest wedding. There is no question that this camera is great for the money. I would not hesitate to recommend this camera to anyone.  Review of DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ with X-S1: The Phantom 2 is now almost 4 years old. I remember the first time I got my X-series camera. At that time, I was on the fence about getting a camera as it was a huge price jump from the point and shoot point and shoots of the day. The X-pro1 was the first and only camera I owned which was my first camera. It was the best camera I ever owned. It had everything. But, at a lot of $$$, I didn't really buy it for that reason. I got it because I wanted to film at an affordable price. I loved how simple and versatile the X series camera is. It has a large 3inch LCD screen that makes it a little more accessible to me. The lens can be a little difficult to get right. I also love the ability to record 1080p video at 30 FPS in 2K at the same resolution as the footage. It's a great combination. If you're interested in the X camera, I highly suggest checking it out. The Phantom II will be a great upgrade. I've already got a few Phantom II and it feels really great. But for the X, you get a more professional camera for less money. You can't really go wrong with the X.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "This phone will be useless for the future," says David Koehler, a software engineer in North Carolina. The Samsung Galaxy S3 has several features that are useless to him: 1) It runs Android, and not the superior (and very popular) Windows Phone. 2) Its battery is not great. 3) Its software is very buggy and it has the worst battery life I've seen. 4) Its camera is not nearly as good as its competitors'.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jessica jones from Love it!!! I've had this phone for a couple weeks now. I love it, I've just upgraded to the black one! It's amazing. It's a perfect phone, and is not an oversized phone, so it's great for people like me who have small hands. I have the S3 and the Galaxy Note 2. The S3 is a wonderful phone for the price, and you can't beat the camera quality, though I think the S2 is a lot better, and definitely the best camera I've used. I just can't help but think about buying the S5 from Verizon, and I don't even like Samsung phones. I'm so happy with the S4, especially the S-Pen and the battery life! I love how easy it is to update, and how quick I can return the phone. This phone is definitely worth the $350.00! If you like a large screen phone with a great camera, I really like the S 3!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These products are very cheap, and as far as I can tell, they are not quality control tested (at least not in the way that I would expect them to be tested for quality assurance).   I have had some issues with these.   When I plugged a computer into one of these, the computer would not work. Â When I plugged it back in, it would work only briefly.  This happens with all of the products I've purchased from Radio Shack.  Some of the things that don't work:  - An external monitor on one of my products would not turn on or work at all.  - A USB audio device would not play.  What are the most important steps to take when dealing with these?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you are going to give a bad review to an electronic device, it should not be about the function. It should be about why the device did not work for you.   The best thing to do is not have any electronic device at all.  In addition to the above things, try to remember that if you have problems using your electronic device (phone, computer, etc.), don't just blame the device for not working. Try to figure out what went wrong.  Make a list of the device and how it is working.  If that doesn't help, try taking apart the device. If that does not help, get a service manual, or just get someone else's opinion.  What you don't want to do in these situations is get upset because the device you bought for a particular situation just did not solve your problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are several things you need to know about me first: I'm a big boy. The phone is a 7.6" LCD with a QWERTY keyboard. The battery is 2 hours and 17 minutes. The display is very bright, clear, and the camera is pretty good. The only problem I've had is the device is too light to carry around. It weighs a total of 6.3 ounces, and is about an inch thick. It's not much of a problem though, because I usually carry a few of these around. They are easy to set up and use. I'm not a computer guy, but my brother is, and he loves them. They don't have any of the fancy features, like WiFi or GPS. I'll use them for video chat, e-mail, or even video games. They have their own web browser. I've used a number of tablets over the past year, but I was always hesitant about using one because of the size. The Zephyr is a very compact and light device. It is not as powerful as my tablet, but has great features. I am very happy with this purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The electronic keyboard is not very good. It's easy to switch from the normal function keys to the arrow keys (the other 2 keys) but it's a pain to use the arrow key at the same time because of the shape. It doesn't matter if you hit it with the left or right arrow key, if you're a leftie you're never going to know which one it is without trying to move the entire keyboard around while in use. Also the power switch is too weak. My biggest annoyance with this is the fact that the keyboard is very small and thus I find myself accidentally hitting the arrow and escape key while trying to enter text. So in conclusion, I don't recommend this keyboard to anyone who is willing to put up with the small size and weak keys.Read full review

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem is that i had a problem with the first one so i took a chance on this one. I didn't have the time to install it so i just got the new one. The problem with this one is that the screen is so bad that i can't even use it to read the messages, when i turn it on the screen turns off. i have to turn the screen on manually everytime i need to use it and that's it. So the screen can't be turned off or something like that. Theres nothing to do now except to buy another one.  The Problem:  This is an all plastic watch. It works perfectly as a fitness tracker and a timer, and has the functionality of a smartphone, but it does have one major shortcoming that makes it unusable for some users: it requires a battery, and most watches (including this one) do. This is where this watch has the same problem with a plastic battery as other fitness trackers, such as the Fitbit or Jawbone. And because it doesn't come with a battery like a fitness band or a phone does, the watch has to be plugged in at least once every few days. Hands down the worst watch I've ever had. I've been using these since 2012 and I can safely say this watch is unusable. The display is incredibly bad, the battery life is horrible, the buttons are all hard to reach, and the watch simply doesn't work. I can't recommend it at all.

This thing will not work correctly and there is no way you can expect it to for $200+ dollars, in addition to having to fix the battery on every battery change. I had the same battery replacement on a previous phone that lasted 3 years, so I'm just not buying this thing again. The battery does have some life remaining, but the software is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If the product was just a bit more expensive I would get it. The device is well made, and if you're using it on the go, it would be very nice to have the device charged and ready for use. I use it as an external hard drive on the computer, which it will do a good job of. I bought the 128GB capacity because I have a 500GB external harddrive, and the 512GB capacity was already on that. However, even though the capacity is a lot, and it's plenty large, I have been forced to use a lot of the space. The only reason I have not given it a "10" rating is because, even after paying for the price increase, the product is not always as smooth and fast as it could be. I have noticed that it does take a bit of fiddling to get the software to recognize the drive as a virtual drive. The speed on the drive is also not great, and I have had some random access and disk crashes.  Product Review: Supermicro SuperServer SYS-5016E-RTR Server Motherboard
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am completely and utterly disappointed with my purchase. The sound on the headphone is incredibly bass heavy and I can't stand the music. My bass is so weak that I had to turn the sound down all the way to half power so the sound could be better reproduced. That was a month ago and my hearing hasn't changed at all. I've tried a couple of different headphone models and this is my absolute favorite by far. My favorite is the Sennheiser HD280. I have to find one that sounds like that.   It's not a bad headphone, but not what I was expecting. The headphones are nice and light and the cord is a lot better than I expected. It does get a bit warm if I go in for more than a short while, but I don't usually wear these with my computer anyway. If you want a good quality pair of wireless headphones, this is probably not for you.  The sound:  This is one of the best wired headphones I have tried. The bass is amazing, you can't hear yourself breath and there is no distortion. The treble is well balanced and neutral, but has a little extra brightness when you crank the sound up on a higher volume setting. The mids are great and don't feel fatiguing, and the overall sound is great. The only thing that I don' think they need to improve on is sound isolation. I feel like I'm wearing earplugs all the time when I wear these and if the sound is getting through my whole house I think it could be a lot worse.  Â  The comfort:  One thing I really like about these headphones is that the headband is very comfortable to wear. The padding around the earpieces is nice and wide, and doesn't get uncomfortable fast. These are very light at just over 10 ounces and feel very sturdy.  I can get them to stay on my head no problem. The cable is also very comfortable, though I don''t see how that would be a problem if they had a longer one, but the regular cable is long enough for me. Overall, the sound quality is fantastic and the headphones do what they need in my opinion.

I'm a sucker for books that can be read on an electronic device and this is that book. The color of the text is great!   The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because, like any book, there are many typos, bad grammar, and sentences that go on forever.   You have to look through a lot of the book to figure out which one's you're looking for and a lot can be missed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "The product was great until it was accidentally broken by one of my coworkers. I was hoping it was just a small thing, but it's broken, and the battery isn't even replacement-level."  I would say that there is something seriously wrong with this particular product if it only took the phone in for service and it couldn't even service itself! There has been a lot of complaints about the fact that the charger only takes AA batteries; I would strongly suggest to purchase a battery adapter for this device!  My wife has an iPhone 4 and she was very pleased with the quality of the phone, but not to the point of being upset with the iPhone 4. However, after using the original battery for a few days, she noticed the battery would occasionally be drained (due to the battery "sucking") so she bought a new battery, and she is very pleased. She also noticed that the original charger was actually very difficult to remove from the phone. After searching for a good charger on ebay, I found a unit that was nearly impossible to remove. I thought that I would try this unit, and it was very difficult for me to use. It felt like a toy. I am going to try another unit, but I doubt that this unit will last for the length of time that I am planning on using it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    How you make use of this article: If you are a regular reader of this website, you may be aware of my previous blog Â on the best laptop screens on the market. I have always been impressed with how well they are designed, how good they look, how much you pay per year, and the lack of bloatware. I was always looking for an alternative and had always had my eye on the Dell XPS 15. While I had read some reviews about the build quality, I felt like this had a lot of potential, especially with the Intel Core i5 7200U. I chose this as my main computer because it is the most portable I can get while still having a high resolution display. I also bought the Dell UltraSharp U3415W monitor to give myself a bit more display to work with. The system works like a charm. The only thing I really can complain about is how loud it is when it's not in use. It's no problem though as I bought a cheap external amplifier. Also, I'm using a 32gb memory stick which comes with 8 gigs of ram. I'll be doing a lot more online stuff and will probably use this a lot. The computer I have right now is on the second generation and I'm quite happy with it. So far I'm very pleased with how much of my life is on my computer. It keeps up with me, it's always on, it does everything I need it to, and I've had no issues. I would like to thank Lenovo for giving me this laptop. It is so much more than I ever expected. Thank you for listening to my story. -Mike

For one, the screen is small and hard to use and the buttons don't work well with finger clicks.  The microphone and speaker don't do much at all.  If you want a good gaming laptop, look elsewhere.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Nick from Great laptop I have this laptop and love it. The only things I would change is the keyboard because it's just not as responsive to my click as the one on my laptop. Other than that it's great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "This is the worst device I have ever bought! It is like the old 'Honeywell' style computers. It is not very reliable, and I don't even think it's any good for the price! They are junk. I can't use this computer to edit anything. I only use this for the web. The main problem is with the mouse buttons, which are not even the right size. I had to re-adjust them on the computer. Then it has a lot of problems with making sound. I use the internet and music through the computer and this thing is not even stable. The only thing that keeps this thing stable is the fan that is always on. Then the computer does not have enough power to run my internet or music. After a few months, it stopped working entirely and the unit was in a box for two years without any repairs or maintenance. There are so many other better computer choices on the market. I hope Honeywell and Microsoft learn from this bad experience and never try to do what this company did. It will never happen again!" "I've got three of these things in an old Dell PC running Windows Vista. In terms of build quality, they're just about what you would expect from a computer in the same price range. In my experience, they are more trouble than they're worth, but for the money, this may be a decent alternative to an expensive Mac. I think you can get a Windows XP or Vista machine on eBay for about the same amount of money and still get a decent quality computer. I don 't use the computer much, but it does a lot to save my time. I have to admit that it is quite a nice computer to be able to do video conferencing without paying for a dedicated machine. But for the average user, these will probably be a total waste of money." "What a bunch of clowns. I bought these when the computer came in the mail, not knowing any better. I've never had any problems and the thing works perfect. I got it for $150, what a joke. " I have bought a number of these for various projects and it is always a problem with them. The fan is always running even when it is off and the memory is always bad.   It is the same with all of the rest of the computer's. 5.0-2: Â -Â  5 stars -  Â "What

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you have a good device, I don't see any point in trying to upgrade it - no matter how cheap the original product was. For some reason, there is no market for high quality, well made devices (like many of the cheap products I buy).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is hard to believe that in 2014, we still need to rely on a "key" to enter our home.  It has become a "thing" to have a key to open our front door.  Even if we live in a two bedroom house, we do not really use the door. We can just turn a knob to open it, but still, it is cumbersome.  We could just have a push button key, but if we lose the key, we will have to go back to using the key that was supposed to be there the whole time.   Posted by Darryl B at 7:23 AM

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The one thing I really like about this unit is its slimness. It isn't an ATV, but at the same time it is smaller and lighter than the G9, G8, and G6 units. When it comes to the quality and features, this unit just lacks. I can't comment on how it compares to other comparable models (the E-ATV, the E-E-G2, and the E6) as I haven't used any of those, but I will say this: it seems like it would be nice to be able to charge the unit using USB. That is what I will be using with my other electronic devices, which are mostly batteries and power tools.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jb from Great purchase I love the E1-E5. It charges quickly and is very quiet. The battery life is good. I do not use the USB mode with my smartphone, I use the AC mode. :I: It took me several weeks to make this purchase. I wanted something more robust than the E5, but still very slim. This unit fits the bill, and it also provides a convenient battery compartment. It doesn't take up too much space, but it's a little snug, so I keep a pair of wire cutters handy. In addition to the battery compartment, the unit has a small rubber handle with a little lip to prevent it from sliding. I like this design, but my first impression was that the rubber handle would get lost in my pack. The rubber handle is really not needed. I have my trusty G9 backpacking pack with a large handle that doesn't slide into my bag.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A lot of people are going to say that these are "poor quality" but that is because the "quality" is poor.   This is a cheapo knock off of a real "audiophile" device.  This device sounds like crap.  I'm looking forward to the replacement.  I was very happy to get this as my first purchase from this company and will purchase again.  The sound quality was amazing and the performance was flawless!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For a couple of weeks I had a bad problem with my iPad 2. It would stop working in the middle of the night when the battery was about half gone, and it would still not charge. I was afraid to try to fix it myself (no one in the family had ever had a problem with a previous iPad), so I brought it to a local repair shop.   The technician told me the problem was that the original screen had failed, and the original battery had failed (which is why the machine would not charge at all after having been out for a while), so the only fix I could think of was to replace the battery.  Â  In order to do that I would need to take it back to the store for repairs.  (My apologies to all the people who have sent me iPads in the past who have been put off by the time/cost of a full repair.) I spent the next couple of days just using the computer without power, waiting for the battery to charge, and just plugging it in when I could.  The repair guy came out a little over a day later and replaced the old battery. It was a bit of a struggle (it took a while to charge), but a small success!   (It turns out the battery had been slightly damaged during the replacement and had some corrosion on it.) So now I have a working computer again.  While it is not perfect by any means (the screen still gets stuck in the dock sometimes), at least it works.  I am considering buying a new screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My first electronics purchase was a couple of years ago when my father brought home an old Motorola cell phone for his dad and I to use in college. It was great, the voice recognition was excellent, and the screen was bright and crisp, although I'm not sure it was ever that good in the first place because the battery kept dying. After a few months of use, the battery would die as well, so it was pretty clear that we needed to switch it to something else.   This is a really cool idea, but I find it difficult to believe that anyone who isn't looking for a new cell phone would really spend this kind of money on a computer.  It's a great idea if you're looking to upgrade, and it will give you the freedom to work on a desktop computer without having to rely on WiFi (which isn't much of a solution anyway). But if you want to upgrade from a cellphone to a laptop, or get something more sophisticated, you're better off getting a more expensive computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This phone is the worst product I have ever bought. First of all, the battery is so bad that my phone runs on the charger with no problems. I bought a Samsung Galaxy S4 but I am using this phone just fine. But the main problem is that it's so difficult to operate.   The front camera doesn't take any good pictures and it only has a tiny LED flash.  My phone doesn't even work with my Bluetooth keyboard!   So I've been using a cheap cell phone from Verizon.  A cheap Samsung cell phone   I am using a $30 cellphone (from Verizon) with my iPad 3   To me this phone is a $500 phone!  Worse than the   cheap cellphone   In terms of quality, the build is decent.  It has a screen and a good battery that lasts quite a while.  The only real flaw is the camera. It takes really terrible pictures and is very inaccurate.  This is a "real" smartphone so I guess you can say this is a decent buy.  But at this price it's hard to justify buying something that takes horrible pictures and isn't as easy to use as a "feature phone".  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What a piece of garbage! I bought the N2 for a school project, and was thrilled to have one of the most compact wireless printers on the market. After about 6 months of use, I noticed a serious problem: The power supply (which I thought was a power supply) would cut out after a period of several hours of continuous printing. I assumed that it was a bad connection in the printer, but I eventually traced the problem to a connector inside the printer that is meant to plug into a power strip at the office. After unplugging it from that strip, the power supply started working again. I contacted Apple and explained that I was going to have to purchase an entirely new printer, and if they had any suggestions for a replacement part, they would be great. Unfortunately, the phone call was a total waste of time as the person who took my call never even got back to me. I have sent several emails, but have not heard back from Apple yet. I'd recommend purchasing a new printer that's compatible with this problem, rather than paying for a 3D printer that will break after a year of use.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

I took it to my local guitar store and had them replace all three capacitors on a $75 cap. I am so disappointed in this guitar, I paid $249 for it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A good example would be an HP Elitebook 940 G3. The price is almost half the size of the Apple Air, it can connect with multiple peripherals, and it has an SD card slot (the Air only has one) in the keyboard tray. Unfortunately it doesn't even come close to the Apple keyboard in terms of ease of use and keyboard quality, which is why I bought a different laptop. It's also quite heavy which means that if it were to fall onto my lap I don't think that it would be a big deal. A bad example is the Dell XPS 13, which is a better computer but only has a 1080p screen (I'm not sure how it feels with a lower resolution), it also costs over 50% more.    In terms of software:  I can't give software reviews for the above two because they aren't my favorite ones. I can write about their software though.  If I had to give them a score, I'd say that the XPS 11 has the most features but not the best experience in them. The XPS 16 has more features and is a more enjoyable computer overall but has a slightly worse UI/UX and a few software bugs that are annoying.  The X Series is definitely more expensive. Â The Dell Xps 15 is my top recommendation as it has a solid keyboard, a large trackpad, and decent battery life.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - The device is a tad on the big side for my needs but is good if your budget is limited. I had some problems with the device not recognizing the serial port and the serial monitor. The serial monitor would sometimes only show 0s and in some cases no information. A software patch would fix that problem.  - No USB host port.    - No micro SD slot   The device came in a nice hard case, the cable is a nice design, and it works.  For the price, this is a good deal at $70. The problem is, it doesn't quite meet the promise of what you get for the money.  It would be better if the serial interface was more flexible, but the other features do their jobs well.  The only negative I have is the USB host is a bit slow and doesn't support any USB 2.0 protocols.  You also have to use the USB OTG adapter, which can be a bit awkward. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device is not easy to use, as it only have 5 modes to choose from: low, medium, high, full, and off. I am disappointed because the features of the device are not usable. The buttons don't have a way to select a mode from the main screen, as well as not providing any way to get an error message when a particular mode is selected. After choosing a mode, the buttons stop working. The main screen doesn't allow you to change the speed or any other setting of the motor so you have to use it manually. The button works fine, but there's no feedback. There's also no way to send a message to your friends so you can explain why your phone is broken. In short:  I didn't like the feature set of the gadget and was disappointed at it's price.  5 / 5 Best I've Ever Used! I bought this for the money I spent. It's a good toy that is extremely accurate. My husband loves to watch me shoot.  on June 11, 2013

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The first time I played with this guitar I thought it was overpriced. It's got a lot of sparkle in it, but overall, not great.   What I would like to see is a maple neck with less neck-thickness. Otherwise, it's not a bad guitar.  It's a nice looking guitar, and has a great sound. I have two of these, and the sound on the one I have now is just as good as when I first bought it.  This is a great beginner guitar for $150, if you don't mind a maple fretboard.  You will be very happy with this, if that's your thing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a very good product. I bought it a year or two ago because I wanted to replace the keyboard on my older IBM. I also wanted to go all digital, and since my main computer had an internal hard drive, it made the most sense to replace that, too. I am so glad I did! There's no longer any risk of viruses or file corruption that I can't handle. It's really just a keyboard and mouse. The mouse is more comfortable to use than the keyboard (especially for those who tend to put their feet up in front of it a lot) and the screen resolution is great. I do have two gripes: 1) there is no way to change a USB port on the keyboard without going through the user's manual; and 2) the screen's screen-grabbing capability is pretty limited. I use a laptop with a better screen, so this isn't an issue for me, but it is an annoyance if I'm on a plane or traveling in a noisy environment, for instance.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an amazingly cheap product. At first, the sound quality was awful and it would always reset on the first time it was used. I ended up returning it and replacing it with a better unit. The sound quality is very nice. The only reason I give it a 3.0 is because I use it very occasionally and would like it to work as a speaker. I would probably buy it again and maybe use it with my laptop.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tod from Very Good, but... I purchased this headphone amplifier a few years back. I loved my old amplifier because of its sound. However, I recently upgraded to a Mac laptop with a headphone amp. My old amplifier sounded bad. The Mac laptop had a very bad mic with a very low volume. The new headphone amp, however, is fantastic. The mic on the new amp is very high quality and I haven't had a problem with it. I also like that this amp only has one input, so I can use it in a regular laptop, as well as my iPhone.  to buy a headphone amplifier from Home Depot is very expensive. The one I got, however was in good shape and had no issues with it being plugged into my computer. I like the volume control and the fact that it doesn't have a volume knob.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have never really liked the idea of having an electronic device that can listen and speak to me, but I suppose this would be more like a companion for a long period of time than just a device for an hour every morning. It has two buttons on the top that turn on/off the computer and microphone, but it's more about having the device as a sort of assistant rather than an electronic mouthpiece. It's pretty cool to say the least.  This is the part I hate:  The USB ports don't get a good review. The USB charging port is just as small as the power port. The audio ports are good but just barely good enough to get the job done (which is a lot).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received this watch as a gift from my wife. The box was damaged in shipping. After reading all the reviews about this watch not working, I emailed the seller and explained my concern. The seller explained that the watch did not work and sent a new one. After sending the old watch back to him I received the replacement. The replacement is a different model from the one I received. I had it on for about 10 minutes before it went to bed. I was able to make a phone call (this watch does not have a microphone on it). I have been using my mobile phone to look at the time. So I don't know what went wrong. I would not recommend this item, but would buy another if I knew it would not work.

So I'll buy another one.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from great product, bad box Bought this as a backup and after the 1 year warranty, I just wanted to keep the unit so I purchased this one as well. The box was bad. The cable is nice though.   .  The unit is just as advertised. I've never experienced such a low battery life on any other smart plug.  in my opinion, this unit is worth it's price tag as a replacement for my existing smart plug that was 2 years old and was constantly failing due to low battery power. The smart plug works very well and has no problems at all (in fact, even when charging my laptop on the go (power outage), the plug still works fine. Just a very low battery. I am very happy to have purchased this unit and will continue to do so. I would recommend this to others looking to have a smart plug, just remember to buy a replacement with a 2 year warranty (the original had a 1 year).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     My first experience with the T3s was awful. There was a significant delay in the first few minutes of setting the T4's up because it was set up to automatically start as soon as I plugged in the T2s. It takes a long time to figure out which end of the connection cable to pull out for the T1. It does, however, have an auto shut off feature that I use often. I will say that my experience with setting the D-5T up was very smooth and I had no problems at all. I am very pleased with the D2's performance. The D2 was great in a quiet bedroom but, as always, I will be upgrading with the E4 when my cable runs are upgraded.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have used these things for years.   They were the first thing I purchased when I got an Apple   iPhone.  They have never worked right, so I always switch them out.  I do have to change my battery about every three months, because the one that came with the phone was no longer holding a charge, and I always get a new one.  The problem with the battery last year was that the connection for the charger fell out, so my iPhone wouldn't charge.  This is still a bad device.  It does work when connected to a computer.  But when it is connected to the car or a computer, it has a bad shorted out battery that makes the phone useless.  If you want to use your iPhone for calling or sending texts, you will have to buy a new battery.  My problem with these is that they are supposed to be waterproof and they are not. I use a car charger that has a USB port on the bottom of the charger so that I can charge my iPhone while I'm in the shower, and it has worked fine so far, but I will be trying a different USB charger soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So far this is my second Ducky. I had the original one for a long time (2 years) and loved it, and now I want a new one.

You cannot connect your keyboard to the computer without the USB cable. That is a total bummer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So you think an Apple 3G should be a 2.3G.   When the battery is half empty the phone does not work at all.  If you have a 3G then buy the Motorola SBG6580.  I am using the Motorola phone and it is working fine now.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am a very new user, so forgive me for not knowing much about this device, but I have to say that the product is pretty cool. I can have this unit in my pocket, or in my office and it has two functions for me, with the remote you can control my house lights, and the remote is small enough to fit in my front pocket. The software that this comes with is very good, easy to use. I am glad I bought this product. This is one of the few units that I can use from anywhere, and it's very handy! The only thing is that it can be hard to charge if you have a lot of devices plugged into it, so I recommend charging it while it's on a low battery level!  I purchased this for my house as a backup device to the DVR, I bought a Roku 2 for my TV and now it has the remote to control it too. This has saved me a lot, since the cable company had no problem giving me a charge for this TV, but if I needed something different, this is what I would need.  It does not have to be this way!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been looking for a replacement for a very long time. I have tried several of the cheaper, "cheaper", or "cheap" versions of the iPod Touch and the iPhone. I finally decided to buy one. After doing some research I have found that the latest model has a high price tag. I would rather spend the extra money to get a quality product at a good price. Unfortunately, the Apple iPad does not have the same price tag of the original iPod Touch. If the iPad can be compared to the iPod's original price then it should be able to hold its own as well. However, the problem is that the iPad is not as good a device as the iPod touch. If you are looking for the best of the best, then you are better off with an iPod Touch (which are the same device) than with an iPad. That being said, if you are not worried about your privacy I suggest getting the iPad. It's a great device. I like the fact that you can charge your iPad and its external battery. I also like the way that it can connect to a computer over USB and transfer data to the computer. Lastly, the iPad's display is a very nice display. It is bright and crisp.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As I said in my previous review of the HP ProBook 5400s, the HP 5400 is just a horrible product. For its time, it's still a fantastic laptop. I had the first model I bought in 2001 for $1000 and had just bought a new one a few months ago (about $2500).   This is a pretty good budget replacement for the iBook.   I would have liked to have seen a full size disk drive in it. The only reason I haven't gotten a new computer since I bought mine is because I couldn't afford to.  I was actually looking for a Dell Optiplex 755 (the one with the 6.2 GHz Pentium D, 32 MB RAM, 128 MB flash card, and 500 GB hard drive), but the 5400 just didn't meet my needs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For years I've wanted to be able to do this.   I have my iPod Classic and it is pretty decent.  There is a nice little feature where you can go to the playlists on your iPod and you can add new songs to it.  However, once you add a new song to the playlist you can't play it. Instead, you are given the option to add it to your favorites.  I like to go back and add songs to my playlist.  Unfortunately, you have to have the player on to add songs. I have an iPad and I would love to use it for my radio.  The interface is pretty much the same, except it has a new music page for you to view your favorites and add new items to your playlists.  One thing I like about the iPod app is the "quick add" feature.  Just go to iTunes, select your iPod in the list and select add music.  Once added, it is there for you at all times and there is no waiting on a list to be processed or an icon to appear.  You just press play, no need to remember to add items to the list.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    We have had the new iPad 3 for a few months now and I would have to say that we were very satisfied with it as a device. We had purchased the previous iPad 3 in a 4GB upgrade to see how that would compare and so far it seems that it is just as good a device as the older model with just a little less storage capacity. The new model is larger than the old model so when you want more space the iPad 4 will work great. We have purchased several accessories for the new tablet and our only complaint is that the magnetic charging dock doesn't seem to hold the iPad very securely. When charging it from a desktop we have had issues trying to get the charger to hold it and I am hoping that will get solved by the time we use the iPad for our professional applications.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love the idea of an intelligent device that can take care of my dog, my elderly father, my grandchild, or myself. Unfortunately, my dog's leash broke last week and I was told I had to pay a big repair fee. This did not satisfy me. It took 4 weeks to find a replacement, so I decided to get my money back from a bad warranty. The replacement leash is NOT a good leash. I've had it for about 3 weeks and I am very happy with it, but that is all I need to say about it. I have read about the "smart leash" on the website, but it does not work for me at all. I had hoped to have it for Christmas but have already spent $50 plus on it. If I can find it again, I will probably buy a new leash.  Amazing Quality and Performance! I got this for my two cats, and they have been playing with it all day long! I can put on the little things they have trouble with, like the dog door, and make it a little more accessible, and I can see how great this could be for my wife who's a small dog but still needs to be caged for exercise. Very durable, a great size, and super fun to play with. ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I love my HP printer but the printer is hard to use.    This is a great printer but I wish they would make a cheaper version, a cheaper printer.  This is the worst printer I have ever used.

I don't know why they do this, maybe we are just an old people group but I hate this printer and I don;t like it, if you buy this, don;'t waste your money on this, you will not like it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only negative I could find for this device is the charging dock for your phone. It is a cheap, poorly made piece of plastic that has not lasted more than a week. I will keep buying these as I find out how long they last.  Product Rating: 5 out of 5-stars. ...  "Cannot get enough" This is my third one of these! This is the best deal on the market and it comes in 3 colors! I am totally amazed with the battery life on these things! I can go about 4-5 days between charges without recharging!   One negative I have found is they don't take too long to charge, it will take a bit to do the normal charge cycle with this one but when I go to charge my camera it will not charge because the batteries are getting too hot.   If you're looking for a simple way to keep your smartphone charged up and don't want to shell out for something like a battery pack or a wall wart to extend the life of your phone the Samsung EVD is your ticket!  Pros: Excellent Battery Life (5-6 days), Simple to Use (Does not take up much space)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -   It is very disappointing that we had to go and do another order because this one had an issue with the power cord. The problem was that it was cut by a large chunk which made it extremely difficult to move the device to and from the computer. It was very embarrassing and upsetting when we noticed it and tried to fix it without being able to. We will not purchase another from this company.    Would recommend:  Â    I am a loyal customer, and the product is great for the price.  - I was pleased when I heard of the deal because I have heard many great things about this product.  We were very pleased with our electronic parts purchase from TINTS. We've used these parts in several projects. The quality is very good.  I love the low price and the wide variety of products.  Thank you for helping me save money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is a good review about my ZX2.   It works perfectly, as advertised.  It does however need the battery replacement.  The replacement for a single cell battery is not included.  So the battery should be charged prior to using the ZX to be sure it is fully charged.  My ZX is just about worn out and I would have bought another one, but it is not an especially good value.  I am in the process of purchasing a new ZX3 and hope to be pleasantly surprised by it as well.

There are plenty of things to complain about, not the least of which being the horrible battery. I was having a conversation with a friend the other day and she was saying how this phone is so great for her. I told her to tell her husband, who has a Samsung, to not bother getting it.  Other than that, its not a bad phone. I do have to use it a lot more than I wanted to. I will give it that for the price you can't beat it and its good for the occasional call or video chat.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A terrible thing happened to me when I was trying to charge my Apple Ipad 4. It was charging and it got completely red-hot.   I didn't have any spare power.  When the red-heat was on it was really painful and I tried to turn it off but the device kept flashing (that's what happens when you have a non-standard charging system). I had to call Apple and they told me that they couldn't replace it or send me any spare parts.  I guess I can only use it on my iMac   The other negative thing was that my battery died in the first month or so (it was 2 years old) so I had no other choice but to buy another new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just bought this and I have to say I've been extremely disappointed. My problem is it doesn't do what it's supposed to do! It doesn't work correctly. I've plugged my cell phone into it, tried to play music and can't find it. If I connect my computer to it and then put my cell into the phone adapter it'll start playing music and my computer can download songs but there is no way to make my phone play. I can play music in the phone but no sound coming out.  5/5 for the price! Love this thing!   Very simple, works great. I was skeptical about the price tag but it was well worth it. I plugged my mp3 player into the USB and my mp4 player into my computer so i could download songs. If you want to have the phone on and have it not play anything at all...I would buy this thing and it works great for that.   Pros: - The device itself is solid - The usb cable is long enough, not too short - The connection to my computer is easy (it came with a cable) - The phone adapter is made well - The charger works well, the cord is long, not long enough to be painful when you are charging the phone in the adapter. Cons: - While the phone/dongle combo is pretty easy to use, the connection to the phone is pretty weak, I had to force my phone to connect to it. - The fact that the phone doesn't recognize the phone when it is in the charging dock. That sucks! I have no idea what is going on but this is a deal breaker. And yes, I do have a warranty.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is a good price but not perfect for most of the uses I use it for.  It came as a two pack of six.   The two packs were different.  One was a black colored plastic box with the USB cables included, while the other one was a white colored plastic with no cable included.  The only problem with that one is the box is a little heavy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The best phone on the market.   In a world where cell phones have gotten so much worse, the Moto G is still top of the list.  Moto G 2013 Review  Moto X Style, Verizon, $499.00 $499 The Moto X does look a bit "too big" to me.  I could care less that the Moto X looks like a regular phone (I like the design),  The only negative I have is the fingerprint scanner isn't as accurate as I'd like.  The camera is great (better than many competitors) and I love how much more secure and easy to use the fingerprint sensor is compared to just going straight to unlock (like on the Galaxy S4 and S5).  Motorola is finally getting its act together!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We purchased the Apple TV a few months ago, and were absolutely blown away by the overall experience.    The remote is very well made and a really great price.  They did a nice job with the color selection and the layout is very simple and easy to use.  However, we have a lot of cable TV that we still watch, so we don't use the AppleTV in that way.  The picture quality is absolutely amazing.  It's easy to see all of the channels and it's clear and easy on the eyes.  I was able to watch shows like The Voice of America and Breaking Bad over a 100 feet away from our house, and the picture is still crisp and clear.  One of the more impressive parts about the Apple is that it doesn't matter if you have 4K or 1080p TV's.  Both of my 1080p models (my original and the new 4K model) worked just fine in my living room with the Apple.  We watched a couple of episodes of a new TV show called The Crown (a great show).  It looks incredible.  Unfortunately the Apple doesn't have a microphone.  In the future I'll just buy a better remote.  The Apple TV has gotten a lot better over the past few years.  While we still miss being able to control the tv with a remote, I feel like that's a small price to pay for all the great features.  With the latest updates, I'm even looking forward to some of the Apple's "beta" features, including support for 4K, AirPlay, Siri, and more.  If Apple wants to be seen as "the TV" company, I think Apple TV is a perfect starting place. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The e-waste has been in the box for about 2 months now and it has started to slowly make its way around the house. It has done a variety of things - cut into a wire to power a TV, broken into tiny bits to turn on and off a computer, or broken off to turn a hair dryer on. The battery life on this thing is horrible!   This e-nuff is really just a glorified cellphone and has less power and has a terrible display.   There is so much dust in this thing that you have to cover your eyes to see what you are touching with it.  It's not really worth $100.   Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: Joe - Verified Buyer i use this to connect to my iphone. and it works well. if you don't get it and need to connect iphones and ipads. just be sure to make sure your iphon is in the charger mode when you connect it. and the battery in this is not rechargeable so you have 2 options... 1) put it in the dna or charger. 2) buy another ipho in a few months and then put in a rechargeable. its been 2 months   to get a replacement  good product but needs better batteries    in my opinion, the iphono is ok but the charger needs a little work.  i find the battery to be a bit small. i like it but it would be better if it was rechargeable and it had better quality build  Great product!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â I have a Sony Xperia Z2, which I use as my primary phone. It's an excellent phone that is extremely responsive to all the gestures that I need, and the design is clean. Â It's a good phone, but it's just a little bigger and heavier than I'd like.   For $380, I can get a Nexus 5X for around $50 more, and it's more durable, but for me the Z2 is the best phone on the market. I also have a Lenovo Y50, which is pretty comparable.  This is not a good review.  The main issue I have with this phone is the lack of wireless charging capability.  There's an adapter on the box that enables the phone to be connected to a USB-C charger and used wirelessly, but the adapter is difficult to install.  I ended up installing a little mini-USB adapter in my laptop and connecting it directly to the phone using the micro-USB connection on the wall.  With my current USB-B charging cable, I have to remove the battery completely from the phone and then install the adapter.  My laptop does charge wirelessly from the wall, but I can't use it for anything other than charging my phone.  You can purchase a USB extension cable, but if you're using the included cable, you're better off using the USB-A port and USB-PD cable that comes with the phone. I'm really glad I spent a little bit more money on a bigger phone that's made better, though, because I think the Z3 is worth the extra $50 over the Y50.     The phone's software is a lot cleaner than the previous Z line.  It runs Google's latest Android 7.0 Nougat operating system, and is much more fluid than the Z1 and Y series.  Most of my time on the Z is spent using the Google Assistant, which has the same great voice recognition as the iPhone X, but just works much better, because the Assistant is really smart.  Google is finally addressing a long standing software problem:  You have to ask it to do something multiple times to get it to actually do it.  Now, if I just type in Google "What is this?" it knows exactly what I'm talking about.  But I usually want to do things like search the web for information, and "what is this" usually doesn't show
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this in a store, and the customer service rep said they couldn't get the warranty for me, and it was only a matter of time before I would have to buy another one. This model, with its low res, loud speaker, and lack of any sort of remote control, is a total waste of money.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Amazing I got this for my son as he is looking for a home theater speaker. This thing is amazing. The sound is amazing and its a little hard to drive but that just means more of your attention to the speakers. The surround sound is a must if you want to watch movies from anywhere. It is a little loud but I still love it and have bought a second speaker so we can share it. It doesn't have a remote, I'm glad for that because I want to be able to control my son's television. I am thinking of getting this for myself when it's gone, so I can listen to all my movies without the sound of my tv.  Customer Testimonials

The stand is also adjustable so I don't have to lift the monitor all the way off the table.

If you need a dedicated headphone for gaming, or if you are in a small room and want a headphone with a clear audio signature, the DeathAdjester Â is not for you.  2) The Â microphone quality is mediocre,   it can get quite loud, but can't get as soft as the HD600.  3) The cables are a little short, Â they don't have enough length for my use, but I suppose it can be used in a pinch  4) The overall design is pretty  weird,  the black ring with silver accents are a bit silly.  I guess that's because of the price tag.  What I really like about the Razer DeathAdjudicator 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I was not really impressed with the quality of the sound of the music with this soundbar, and while I do like the extra sound and volume controls, it feels very cramped to have the power switch in the middle of the top of the unit.   In addition, the sound gets pretty loud pretty quick, and when you start to crank it up, it starts to annoy.  This is the first sound bar that I've seen that's a lot louder than my previous sound bar, and it makes a lot of noise when it's on.  I have a relatively quiet room, so I expected that I might want more volume, but I don't.  There are two very clear problems with this product: 1) The sound quality is so bad that you would need to plug a subwoofer into your TV to get full volume with the soundbar. 2) It's a bad idea to place the power button on the middle edge of the device.  If you want to charge a phone or laptop and keep the sound bar on, then you need to use a special power cable or connect a power adapter to your TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    We received this ez-link smart-phone a few days ago and I must say I am so disappointed in this product and with the product.   This device works ok but the only reason that i give it 3 stars is because of how it is being sold, it is very difficult to get ahold of the right person to talk to.  If you were to get this device it should have been for the money you are paying for it.  This is the first time we have been disappointed with a device.  We have had our smart-phones and tablets for years and this is the worst.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!  Rated 5 out of 5 by JimfromTN from A great value. I have been looking for a decent, reliable smart phone for a while. This one was easy to use. I was not disappointed with my purchase.  Customer Testimonials
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Review of SONY Z-20XE2D II "Best Sony Portable"     This thing is a dream to work on. I like the fact it has a headphone jack in it, but I can't see a point of having that port unless it is only for music or if you are listening to music while your working. I do like the extra large LCD display, and the audio capabilities are decent for an analog portable. But, what makes this portable even better is the way the Sony controls are set up: you have a track, a mode, and two buttons: one for the mode and one for changing the volume. It doesn't really matter which you use most of the time (so, for example, you could use the volume buttons to set the volume while you are recording to the computer, or you could play with the mode buttons to get the mix just right for the song you are working on). It's simple, functional, and works well. And it's made in America.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What a waste of my time. I was looking to buy a cheap computer mouse. When I got it, it was dead on arrival. There were two very long, thin pieces of metal sticking out of the plastic. It's impossible to tell whether they were intended to hold a battery or not. I'll never buy anything from this company again. The only thing I'd recommend is getting a replacement for the first mouse you buy. If you really want to get a good quality mouse, check out Zowie, Razer, or Razer BlackWidow.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: brand-new-gear
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery is weak. It will last a couple of weeks but then start losing power. The screen goes off and you can't even type. I can use it as a phone and a tablet but not a computer. I have an HTC Incredible, which is much better. The only good thing about the Vibrant is that it looks awesome.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My MacBook Pro 13" (2013) suffers from the same problem as all other "ultrabook" (Apple) laptops. After a few weeks, the power button is stuck in its position, the volume buttons cannot be pressed (as I expected) and the trackpad does not respond. I have had this problem for some time now, but had never seen or heard about it. As a result, I am very pleased that a replacement laptop is available and have it now.  From Anonymous of Atlanta, Georgia on 2/23/2012. It works for a while, then it breaks. It was a cheap laptop.  the keyboard is too stiff to be usable and the screen is the worst i have seen from any laptop. I used a laptop to read this book and read on the laptop. The screen is blurry. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So the device I bought was a cheap little one, not very user friendly and very weak at the same time. My friends all got their lighters and all have had to replace theirs with similar lighters because the ones they got didn't work at all. I bought the small one thinking I'd like it since I was looking for a lighter. But that small one is way to expensive for what it is. It's not a bad device, but I guess the money would have been better spent on something cheaper. The light is really bright, but it's hard to find a good position to hold it to charge it. Also, I'm not a fan of the plastic casing, because it's not made of plastic. It seems like it was designed to get you using a lighter that fits in the lighters drawer but instead you get a plastic case. It still seems pretty sturdy though. And the color is a great color, so it's cute too! Pros: - Bright, easy to hold, fits into the lighter drawer - Really bright Cons: - Plastic case - Hard to find, can get bent around - Not as strong or as durable as the real thing

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The design is decent, but the device is very poorly manufactured. The buttons are easily knocked off by rough handling, or just being dropped on the floor. There are other electronics inside that require an active cleaning to keep working properly. The battery life is about 4 hours. The audio quality is poor for such a small device. There is no headphone jack for stereo audio. There's also no USB power at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My son purchased a very inexpensive electronic toy, a Tickle Me Elmo, and was not impressed by it at all. The plastic enclosure is hard and does not play nice. When the little guy has a "wacky" idea to shake the ball, it shakes. He was not pleased with this. Not recommended for a small child.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -   I bought this as a replacement for my old "toy" mp3 player. First thing you can tell from the start, the quality of the speaker is pretty poor. The sound is harsh and the bass is awful. The volume controls are OK but the speaker sounds terrible. The second thing is, I'm not a huge fan of the design. It seems to have poor build quality and the design isn't very good. I could do without the remote as well, the only thing that was helpful was being able to change the device mode to portable, but that was a pain. I'm still keeping my fingers crossed that it will last, but as it is, it's useless to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â I bought a smart phone that I used for an hour or so. It was very noisy. The screen on the phone was just too small. I also had to put it on my wrist. It is not a good phone and I have only used it a short time.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     In my opinion, these two products were great until the warranty ran out on the original, and the new was useless.   I had the iPhone 4 for several years and finally decided to upgrade to the iPhone 5 because it seemed like the right phone to upgrade. I bought the Nexus 5 and it was like the iPhone has a 5 year old problem. It was completely unstable and would randomly quit on me. The only thing I got out of it is a little extra storage.     This review is very long, but the best is when I get to the end and see how long the warranty has lasted:  In my opinion these two devices were great. It didn't seem like the company was trying to rip off customers, but it wasn't exactly cheap either.  The battery in the iPhone seems to die quicker and slower than the Nexus 4. Also the iPhone doesn't have the volume buttons, so it's easier to lose the phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The electronic products are very good, but I have problems with the battery. When I turn it on, the battery light stays on and it doesn't charge. When it comes down, it never charges.   I really liked the battery capacity when I first bought it, but now that I have it I have to put it down to charge every 2 hours or I'm out of juice.  I'm not sure if the battery just needs a better charger, or if I'll need to get the charger that is recommended in the manual (it says to do that before I ever turn it off).   I've been using a Samsung S4 for about 4 months and it has a battery that last me 4 weeks.  Samsung S 4   They don't make them like this anymore.  When you buy a Galaxy S4 do not expect an amazing battery.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      The design of the Vibram FiveFingers, especially with the toes in, is not the greatest. You could fit more feet on a pair of Vibrams than you can on a Nike or Reebok or anything else you can buy. It's just a lot of money for a shoe with limited features.    I wore these for about 10 years in various places and while they did their job they were never perfect. They had a tendency to crack at the toes and rub against a hard floor surface. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone.   the VIBRBA FIVEFINGERS  Rating: Date Posted: Rating: DatePosted: Favorite Color:  Love the classic black with white design.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this device for about a week now and so far I love it. It is very light and fits into my bag without problem. The only negative that I can think of is that the battery life is pretty short (only 6-8 hours of use), but then again I don't use the device for a lot of time and don't mind the short battery life.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They had a bad battery that gave out constantly. They were pretty cheap though for what they were.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device because I wanted to have more space than I had with my previous iPad 2. I bought the 32GB model, and was really surprised by how thin it was (at least compared to my previous 32GB iPad 2). I use this for playing video games, streaming video, and reading ebooks. The screen is fantastic - the colors look amazing and the contrast is just perfect. The device has a very thin bezel and does not affect my vision at all. I can only think of a couple issues with this device, and both are software related: 1. When I am using the screen, I get very tired.   Sometimes, I can't tell if I'm reading the screen or the webpage I'm trying to read.  2. Sometimes when I play a game or do other things while playing, the screen will randomly get very bright and then go dark. This is very annoying and I've had to restart the app every time it happens. I would love to have a brightness option so I don't have to be constantly turning it up and down. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase! I will definitely be getting another one for my bedroom!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i got this gadget, it was so cheap but the screen looked very bright and easy to read.   but i did not use it that much, my problem was a dead battery.   Great for a small space, but bad for the rest of the house:  The idea is great. The first problem I had with it was the battery is way too small. I got mine for $1.25 off ebay and it lasted less than 10 minutes of being on. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These cheap USB drives are an absolute disaster when it comes to their USB power output.   While they should be able to take a maximum of ~100mA @ 5V, that doesn't look to be the case here. I've had two of these go from full capacity to empty in under a minute when plugged in, and two of them have dead ports.  And don't even get me started on the noise output. I don't have to use a separate power supply to use them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a Nexus 6P to replace my iPhone 6 and I have no regrets. I got a Nexus from the Google Play store at Walmart in the middle of August and it wasn't until the week before I had to send it back because the screen was cracked in half (it was on the Nexus 6). I didn't want to wait so I bought it online from the Play Store (which I found easier to navigate and use) and I got an early replacement so the new one arrived in 5 days (the replacement was on my doorstep in 4 days). I use the Nexus as my main phone, but I also take it with me on my trips and I've found it much better to use than my iPhone. I haven't had any trouble whatsoever and it's only been out for 3 months (I bought it at the end of September).    I bought a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge for the purpose of going to Mexico on a trip that was going to last 10 days. I already had a Samsung device with Google Play Store and I didnÂ´t see any point in buying a second device and paying for it separately. I was a little worried about going with the S6 Edge because I was expecting something more solid. I'm happy I went with the Galaxy S and not the S5 due to the fingerprint scanner. I love how good the screen is and also how lightweight it is. I recommend it to anyone looking for a phone to use in travel.  "It's an amazing phone that I really don't know what I would do without."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use my android phone a lot now and i am very impressed with the build and performance of it. The only problem i have is a very bad screen. i am still trying to fix it but the screen is very difficult to read with the light, brightness and contrast set correctly. i have to turn off all my other settings on the phone to make it work and to not get any blueish tint on the screen. not great but at least i have a screen which is a bright color and is not a black screen. I use the internet on the computer with the phone connected and this phone is not very good for watching videos. the video quality is great and the battery life is great but the display does not work with the lights that come on when my ipod is plugged in. if you have a light set up this phone will be perfect for watching a video. If you use the android phone for email and internet the screen will work but the phone will not work if your iphone is plugged into the laptop and the ipod in your bag. i hope the maker of this phone takes notes of this bad review and makes an even better phone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by NervousDiva from I'm not a tech person, but this phone worked perfectly...I'm not even a tech woman. But I did give it a try. And I'm very happy with my purchase. It's a great product. I even used it for the first time to check email and it works just fine. The battery lasts a long time, and it's super light weight.  of course the app for this phone was not as good as the android version. (the app was slow and hard to use). I tried downloading the other apps as well, they were not there either. So I'm gonna give up on this product. But the phone is perfect and will be replaced. I do hope that you can improve the app version of your app to have as many options as possible and to be quick on getting to the options for the user.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have two different phones, two different laptops, one of which is broken and the other one was stolen. I have tried all the methods to return them and I have no answer to how to do it. I am not going to bother calling the police, no more hassle than buying a new phone, or a new laptop or computer. I was very upset when they sent a replacement back. I'm going to have to try to replace my laptop with the one from the other company that is broken. But I hate the thought of buying a device when I am going to get an old one instead! This was a horrible experience, I was really hoping to find a way to make this go away.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    5/5 Excellent! I have been using this for several years now and have been completely satisfied with the product. It does exactly what I want. The quality of the wires are good and the build quality is top notch. I have not yet had an issue with it getting hot to the touch but that is only because I have only used it in my living room and not out in the hot desert. So far it has worked perfectly for me. I really can not say anything bad about the product at this time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     5.00 stars (out of 5) Based on my testing on a Samsung Galaxy S4, it will be a good replacement for my older iMac Pro. This is probably one of the best deals on the market at this time. The video card is fast enough and it is worth the cost.  I've owned 3 other computers over the last 10 years and this is my 3rd one. I've had some issues with my iMac. When I first bought this one I felt that it was too high for my needs, but after I put all of my gear in it, I was surprised that it performed as well as a new computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a good experience buying from E-Bay, however if you can get it for less than 10 bucks they should be able to be replaced without any problem. In order to change the firmware on the controller they have to break out the screwdriver tool and replace the chip in the controller. This could be avoided if they only sold the replacement controller for 10 dollars and not $30. Also the screen isn't clear enough. The screen on the original screen was clear and a better screen than the one on this new one. Also, the screen is not bright enough, it was hard to read things on the computer screen, especially if the screen was dark.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect I bought the product a month ago for my 13 inch iMac and have been very pleased. My old computer had a slow processor so when i got this iMac i was a little shocked and happy to see the speed increase. I was also able to buy the memory upgrade from apple on amazon which was a nice touch. It has a very nice screen for a 13 inch monitor. I use the monitor to work and also for gaming so it has a lot of potential. I will update when i upgrade my cpu and memory. The software is still new so I haven't done much yet.  is the perfect screen size for all my work and is great for working in the yard or in bed
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you have a problem with the "one-click" feature, you can still purchase a second device if you need to.   You can't install a third one without a problem.  And you need a different keyboard with a different key set.  For me, the problems are numerous.  I bought a keyboard from this seller:  I've tried to call the seller at several times, but never had any luck. It was obvious that the phone line was disconnected.  (My phone number is in Bali, Indonesia.)   And, after multiple attempts, I tried to contact them over email, but they never replied.  This seller is now out of business, and it is not worth buying a second keyboard from him.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I bought this to replace an aging Philips CD changer that had to be replaced for a different reason (which wasn't because the CD's were bad, just because the machine wouldn't play the music!). The Philips CD's on this unit can be heard at a distance, so not as noticeable as some other CD players. The built in speakers are nice too. The only problem is the fact that the unit requires a computer to play music. This can be a problem for students that have a computer at home that the school has to borrow or can't afford, or students that just don't like the idea of a computer in their own school or home. Also, if you have a lot of music, it might be a hassle to use it as a CD player. The music is nice but can't compete with the quality of a quality CD player such as the Philips one.   The only thing that I would say is good about this unit is that it is easy to find your music!

If you want a little more out of a flashlight, this one will not disappoint you.  The battery lasts a long time and is very easy to charge.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem:  The first problem is the power cord and the usb plug. I would say you should have the usb cord longer, and the power cable shorter.  I found that the charger cord from my iPad battery was not long enough and after charging it up with my Macbook it would not charge anymore. I could never find a short plug in my house, so I was in a bit of trouble. "You can't fix a broken power cable, just replace it." - I think they are trying to kill the charger, but I wouldn't count on it. I found a new one from Best Buy for a couple dollars less, but it didn't help either.   Another problem is that the USB plug would not stay attached to my iPad when I put it down. I am thinking it is because they changed the charger design, so if the iPad is not in the charger's port, it won't charge.  The fix: - I don't know what they changed to cause this, but they changed it back again. If you buy the one they changed, you can put it in any of the old charger's ports, including the usb. - Just remove the original power adapter plug and use a USB cable. This should work for most iPads, or any of these older power adapters. If it doesn't work, then the charger is faulty.

"  V60 Keyboard (Left) vs V60 Backlight (Right) When it comes to the keys themselves, the keys feel a bit mushy. While they are not as mushy as on my iPhone 7, the V30's keyboard is still mushy, despite it's rubberized back. It's very easy to mistake the keys for a dead keyboard, and my fingers were easily getting impatient. The keys are also a bit stiff compared to my iPhone 6S's, but I believe that's mainly a function of my body.Â  Keyboard (Left, Right) I did not expect the keyboard to be so hard to use, since my iPhone's keys were so mushy and hard to type on. I tried it on my MacBook, which is quite a bit bigger than the V5. The keyboard was indeed quite a struggle, but once I got used to it, it was much easier to type than the iPhone. V 60 Battery Life -   It's amazing how much battery life the V40 offers for a $199 smartphone, and the V45 will probably deliver similarly good battery life for a similar price point. The V30 is actually not that great in battery life on battery, especially considering that it does not have a front-facing camera. I got between 20 and 40 hours of usage on a single charge, depending on what I was doing. This was not too bad compared to the iPad mini 2, but it was still better than the battery life of the iPad.Â  "  The V40's battery life is pretty good for its price point, but for $199, you would probably expect it to last a little longer. Battery Life The V45's battery is definitely something to get excited about. The battery life was great, and easily lasted a full day on a charge, as long as I didn't use anything crazy like streaming games or video editing. The one thing I noticed is that I had to charge the battery after I was done using the phone, but then it would go straight to 100% to get me back to 100%. Overall, I'm really happy with how long my V30 and V45 lasted on a full charge. Charging the V20Â  The charging port for the V50 was pretty similar to the V35, though
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â It's so difficult to use this app and it is too difficult to turn off all the things I don't need.   I have it on my phone now.  I don a few things and turn it off and it starts playing music in my car.  How can I turn off the "tweeting" to only one of the speakers?   How does one get a hold of a hold the number of speakers? How about a little "punch in" at a time?  My "tweeter" is in my bedroom and my music gets louder and louder.  The sound is horrible.  It also blocks my phone and my computer.  In my home, i use this in the bedroom and the sound is perfect.  When I go to bed, the sound stops.  There are other things I wish I could turn off.  This is a must have for the kids who are older, like me.  A few days ago, my kids came in with the speaker playing music for about 20 minutes straight. Â I got up and told them to stop.  They said "well you have to turn it on and off so that's what we do"  The first thing they tried to do was turn it back on and then they did a search and turned it off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love this bluetooth speaker! I have always been an audiophile and I think this speaker has amazing bass and clarity. I just wish the battery lasted longer! I had the bluetooth version of this and it still had 4 hours of battery life left! Not a big deal but it is frustrating. I bought a wireless version of it and the battery was a bit shorter. I've also read that you can pair the bluetone with a smartphone but I can't imagine why. It doesn't sound too good at all. The sound was pretty weak for my preference. Overall, I would recommend this for the bluest of audiophiles. I like my music loud and I like the fact that this device has a small built in speaker. The battery is a bit disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A great idea and the results I've seen were amazing - but they're a pain to install. It is annoying to use, especially when you want to use the wireless mouse or a Bluetooth gamepad. The screen is a huge disappointment and can be very hard to use in low light environments - I would be willing to pay more for a more premium product that was made with more care and was designed to do all that you would ever need it to do. If you're using it with a wired mouse and have a Bluetooth gaming system it will work, but not as well as the other models. Pros: Fast charger with wireless wireless charging Cons: Wireless charging is a bit of a hassle because of its placement and the fact that it requires the use of a wireless charger. Very limited functionality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The device came very soon after the order was placed, and I immediately began using it for the first time. I noticed that the button is on the top of the unit, which is not how I prefer to use my iPod. This made a change from the top-mounted buttons on my old iPod which were closer to the side. The music buttons were a little difficult to reach, and it was difficult to see which buttons were which. There was only one USB-C port and one 3.5mm audio jack on this unit. I have several other USB-to-A cables and an Apple TV for Apple devices. I was initially skeptical about using one USB port for two Apple devices, but after a few use, I feel that I can use a standard USB-A to USB-USB cable. I can't say it is comfortable to use, but it's a small price to pay for the convenience. The case is made of very thick plastic, which would be nice if it were removable, but not a real problem. I've been using it with the case for about three months now, and while there have been some slight changes in quality, it still looks the same as it did when it arrived. I'm a little annoyed that the plastic case wasn't in the original box, and that the unit had some marks and scratches that made me question how durable the plastic was. All in all, this was a pretty good buy, and definitely worth the money.  Good device, but... Review by JOE C.  and the screen is a little dim. But I like the touch screen.    I have bought 3 of them. They are easy to use and the quality is very good. I am a music lover and I prefer my iPod to work like a USB flash drive. This works just right for me.  in addition the case is awesome.   But...   the battery life is poor. This is the only thing I don't like about the Apple product. . This is just a plug and play item, however it doesn't seem to charge fast enough.  is good, the case looks and feels great, but the quality of the battery is not great.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a pretty good unit with some flaws, the worst of which is the charging/data port placement. The charger plugs into a hole in the bottom of the device. This means that if you don't have a case, the charger WILL get damaged by a drop. The device itself is very nice.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Noise from a speaker (not a good thing):   I have two speakers in the bottom of my speakers which I bought as replacements for a dead (inoperable) ones from the same manufacturer. I have a few other devices that I use with the speakers. The only bad thing is the sound from the front speakers is not loud enough. It's not that loud though and is very quiet. I use it as a mobile radio. When the radio is playing from the speakers it doesn't hurt the radio at all, but the speakers are really needed. The other thing that I don't like is the vibration from the speaker, it's pretty bad. I'm looking for something that I can put my hands on, so I wouldn't mind if the vibration were gone from the top.  The only thing that could be better is the speakers on the bottom. They are a bit hard to make out, and the sound isn't the best either.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I tried out the Avanti BV2.0 at CES this year. The reviews were very good and I was very impressed with its performance and features. I went with the "full" version ($2,299), and then I went to Home Depot and picked up a slightly cheaper version (Avanti's BV1.0, but it was $2.95 less). As always, I was excited, as I was going to try to go to the max. But the new BV was a whole lot worse than the BV before. The "full-blown" version was no different from the B1 at all. The sound was flat, harsh, and muddy. I could hear every detail in the B-version, but I couldn't hear anything at all in the full-blown one. I gave up and went back to the B0.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the samsung galaxy tab 8.1 for my samsung s5 lg on Verizon.   This is the third smart phone I've owned but the second from the Samsung's brand.  The first was a Samsung T1 and the other a Samsung galaxy s3 lg.  This phone has problems that the other s3 had.  I'm a big phone guy but after the first month I gave up on the s3.  After that first month and the fact that this phone was only one year old and the warranty didn't come for a year, I decided it was time to give the s5 a second chance.  It was a good choice with all the benefits you get.  But I can't live with this for the sake of my s5l, my other s5 and the s4.  And when I saw I was getting a deal on a Samsung Tab 7.7 on a contract because I couldn't afford my new s5, I was more than a little upset.  There's an easy way to find out how good the Galaxy Tab is.  Instead, I had to go to their website and scroll to see if I could buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 (2012).  But in doing so I found an article that stated that the s7.7 isn't the best device on the market.  Even Samsung's own articles say so.  At least my s4 was a great phone.  So I decided I needed to fix it.  First I took the battery out.  Then I went to remove the s, g, and d buttons.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to remove these two buttons without damaging the device.  Since Samsung doesn't have a page on how to do this.  My first thought was to take a hammer and hammer out all the tabs.  While it looks nice.  If you do this on a phone you're going to ruin it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best Smartphone EVER! I was skeptical about getting a Samsung Galaxy because I've seen their phones fail and the service was horrible on the last Samsung. Well, after using the Samsung S6 for a few days now, I am so pleased with the device, I can not imagine anything worse than my old one. My Galaxy S6 Plus is now my phone of choice and the Samsung Note 5 is on my wish list now! I highly
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the watch as a graduation gift for my brother but he has had two very similar watches and is about to buy a third one of the same style. He loves the idea of having a watch for his daily work routine but when he first got it the screen was very dim, it had not been charged for a few days. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt and charged it before I gave him the watch. The screen is brighter now and the time has a little more range. I have also taken it for a bike ride and it has been fine but there is no way the battery could last more than 4 hours without charging. The watch is not waterproof, the watch band is so thin and it is not easy to attach a strap if you plan on cycling. And the watch has no back light. Overall the watch is a good idea but it's very limited in functionality. I would not recommend it.  Was this review helpful to you? Yes (0) No (0/0)  Not the best   by: MOMS_E_Y from United States Received it on a friday, and i thought i was going to like it but was a little disappointed because it had to be charged 2x. It does not hold up for a full day of work and it will not stay charged with the watch on all day. I was a tad frustrated that this watch came without charging or any kind of charging support. I do not know if they will bring back their other products or this watch.    Was it helpful to know the watch does not have a back light?  Yes (0 ) No (1/1)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone is not as well constructed as the phone that I had used on the other side of the world, and I really can't say that I am very impressed with the quality of the materials used in its construction. I am pleased with the fact that it can be charged via USB but I really wish the phone were designed in a way that allowed the user to put the phone in standby mode so that it could be charged while you are asleep (or if you are away from the house).   It has an integrated battery charger, but it does not charge the battery as fast as the one I had on the outside. I have not used my phone in the past couple of weeks, so I really don't know what the charging speed was like, but I am extremely disappointed that it takes so long to charge a phone like this that you will use it only for a few hours each day or even one or two days before you recharge it.   I am also disappointed that I paid a ridiculous amount of money for such an expensive electronic device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I wanted a new iPad to replace my current one, but I was skeptical about purchasing the iPad mini, because I am on a budget, and the price of an iPad was a barrier. However, this tablet is nothing short of amazing, but at a very reasonable price. The screen is extremely sharp. The touch control buttons are very sensitive. This is very easy to use, but the keyboard could be a little bit more tactile. Overall a great purchase, but this could have been a little more.  More

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm really not an audiophile (as I use a lot of mp3's on my computer) but I do own several high end headphones and this one is a bit too small for my ears and the price is ridiculous. I can't get a decent bass out of it at all and it's extremely noisy for my liking. If I were a tech, I would send it back but I can see that it is probably a better purchase for most people if they are just looking for a decent pair of headphones. I have no idea if it is even supposed to be portable.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product on October 17, 2009. I bought it with the intent to use it as a portable MP3 player (with headphone socket), but it is very light and only works in stereo mode. I can play the entire Beatles catalog (including the very hard to find 7" single) but I can't play the bass notes and the guitar tracks are terrible. The bass track on the Beatles' "A Day in the Life" is a terrible muddy mess. It makes it hard to hear the other instruments. It is also extremely annoying to play because it has to be switched every time I want to play an instrument. The sound is better if you listen to the stereo. I think this was one of the worst purchases I have ever made. My wife tried it out and she is not a fan. She likes her MP3 players to be louder and has other electronic gadgets she uses. She does not like this one at all. If you are on a budget (not cheap) and want to use an MP3 in stereo then it is a good option, but if you need a portable portable player with a headphone socket this isn't the one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - The display was a bit dim, but the battery lasted for a year (I would assume the same with a similar battery on a cell phone). - The wireless range was about 3-4 blocks. It is not great, but I don't mind that much.   - The display   was also pretty dim (I didn't even notice the brightness slider).   Overall, it was a good value. - Overall:  I wanted something for my phone and wanted something cheap (and that also worked well in my area), and I was not disappointed. It's well-made and simple to use. The design is very functional (you do not see a lot of bells and whistles), but there is no fancy lighting or even the typical white backlight. It works pretty well and is easy to use, so I give it a 4 out of 5.  Overall, I am pleased with the purchase. If you are interested in this phone, I highly recommend it!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's like having a really good television and only getting the bad ones. The problem with this is that you don't get a whole lot of viewing options. For example, you could get a 5 channel receiver with an optical audio output for $350, but that just brings the cost of the box to about $450. Now you're spending about $300 more for that, which is a terrible deal. You could also get a good television for less than the cost difference, but if you watch a lot of TV, the extra $200 just isn't worth it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I like this, and I've liked the other electronic devices that come with it. The only problem I see is the buttons don't always work. The battery doesn't last as long, and sometimes it turns on too slowly or doesn't turn on at all. I also wish there was a way to use it as a USB keyboard. I just got a USB hub. I didn't need a keyboard because the device works just fine as a mouse and printer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Dell PowerEdge R710 last November, and since then I have used it only one time. The laptop is not good at all. It does not work at all, and is very heavy and sluggish to boot up and to get into the system. I have tried everything to get it to boot on time:  Â    My motherboard is a nForce2G6 and I tried many different hardware combinations:     Â  nForce3A1   nForce5 x2   It finally worked when I upgraded the motherboard to an   PCI-X1.0 x4  Â   I have also tried different RAM, using DDR2 memory sticks, 2 x 16GB sticks (all of them failed), 2 x 8GB sticks, 4 x 4GB sticks. Â   Finally, I decided to get a   1 TB SSD with a hard drive. But now it works very well, and even when I installed an operating system with only 1 GB of RAM, everything worked fine.Â  Â  Â   I used this laptop for two weeks, and I am very disappointed. The   problem is that it runs hot and slows down. When it is   warm and   very   loud, it is even less likely   to boot into the OS than the   other laptop that   comes with a 3.5 mm audio jack.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this product for about 4 months and I have purchased it several times. This device has a bad reputation. It will do what it says it is supposed to do and it can be very powerful but the sound quality is not good. When you turn the device on it just makes a screeching sound from the motor as if it is breaking in or something. If it had an LCD display or any other sort of display it would be much better. There should have been some sort of instructions on how to use it. It has no battery life on a full charge so be prepared to turn it off at some point. The quality of the electronic device is not up to the quality of this product. It does its job as a device to charge your phone and its power is very low.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am an old hand when it comes to computers. I have been working with computers and the internet since the early '80's. For a long time I had a MS-DOS machine and for a brief time I got an IBM compatable PC. After all these years I just bought a new machine that came with Windows 7 and it was time to upgrade. This machine was not even close to what I had. First of all the case looked like it would collapse at any moment, not the good old "cheap-o-card" that it came in. It was also a real pain in the butt to boot, the keyboard was very bad and hard to reach. I had to use a spare battery to boot and it had a horrible screen. Also it had problems with the touch screen not being able to react when I touched the bottom edge of the screen. It took me a long, long time to decide if I wanted to put it down. After reading reviews for it online I decided to go for it. First the video was awful. I was using the Samsung laptop for work and it looked better and ran better than this. Then the software that comes with it is horrible. I really liked the touch-screen, even though it was slow, but the app selection was a mess. My kids are old enough to use it but my friends say that the touch is a bit "old school" as it's not "touch". I am planning to go back to the original model and just see what the heck I can do to it. I guess I can buy a refurb and use the touch if I can find one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It did not work.   I was extremely disappointed and the company has been very nice and polite in my contact.  My warranty and return was handled extremely well and fast.  However, the battery did not function and I returned it.  I just want to state that I am very much a "novelty" kind of person so I tend to like to experiment.  If you are looking to have fun and try something new this is not the device for you.  Very disappointed and would never go back.  5/5 Just what i needed I bought the battery to run a small flashlight, but it has been working great so far. The only drawback I noticed was when i powered up a small light, and the battery wasn't fully charged it would only stay on a few minutes before shutting off, but this was the only downside to it, and so far it hasn't caused me any issues. The battery is also waterproof, so i have no worries. Highly recommend this to anyone!  3/5 The battery I got was a great purchase. It worked great when I needed a little power to do some light work but when I did use it more intensively I noticed that it got very hot. The power cable that came with it was a big disappointment as I thought it was longer than the one supplied. It also took a while to charge up, and after 3-4 days of use it was still at 60%.  2/5 Charger Not as expected. The batteries were not the best quality but the charging time is not what I expected. There were so many problems I'm very disappointed about this purchase.  and it didn't even have the right plug in the bottom

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because of the reviews of this device. I have to say,   it was not worth the money. I bought a 3 day battery for the first day of the warranty.   It failed on the first night of use. I thought about calling customer service, but they were out of service. I returned it, and I am waiting for them to send me a new battery to fix the problem. I think I will never purchase another one of these.   Great price and quality Product is working perfectly as expected.  Very easy to use and works as it should.  The batteries were packaged very well in a padded envelope to make sure they will arrive in good condition.  If you like to have a more substantial keyboard to play games and such then this would be the keyboard you have been waiting for.

I was able to smoke 2 puffs of this bad boy and by the 2nd puff the taste was not as strong as I would like and the exhale was just a little harsh. If you like the flavor of an electronic cigarette and have a few bucks to spend on a crappy flavor, you'll get your money's worth and then some.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     My new electronic keyboard had a great keyboard and great keys. However, when it came time to type, I found it impossible to type even with my hand. It would not even type letters and would not allow me to continue typing when I needed to type them. When I tried to fix the keyboard I realized that the keys were not bent properly and were broken. After trying to fix them, I realized they were bad. The computer that came with it also was a defective product. The screen was very difficult to read and the battery would only last a couple hours at most. The machine was also very slow and the graphics card was unreliable. In short, the device was a complete waste of time and money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my first review for a product.   This is my only experience with this particular device. It works fine until you put a very thin layer of plastic over the screen.  This has ruined my life.  I have tried a dozen types of LCD screen protectors, some of them are quite good.  I put some over the old iPad i used to have, but i think this one is a lot more expensive.  When i first got the new iPad i thought it was fine, but after using this screen protector i have no choice but to return the product and buy a new one.  Â  i don't like the fact that i have to be careful when working on the iPad while it is still on the screen protector.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had a very hard time finding a good Bluetooth speaker. I had used a Bluetooth stereo headset for several years but it didn't sound very good. I was searching for something that was both a little more portable but also a good speaker with better quality. I came across the    Samsung Galaxy S4 Active  and i purchased one for myself and my son who also use it for phone calls and music.   The sound quality is pretty good for it's size, the remote works well and I like that it has a volume control that's pretty close to my normal level. However, there's a problem with the battery life: It's about 8 hours on a full charge. That's way too long for what it can do. I have only had it for a few weeks and I'm worried that I may have burned through it's battery very quickly. Also, the speaker on my previous speaker was a little too loud so I have always preferred a headset.  So far I have used it about once a day with the remote, a couple of times a week with the phone and about one hour a day (on the weekends) with my son's phone.  I've heard music from the Galaxy S3 for about 20 minutes, I've used the volume controls to turn it down for phone conversations and I don't like that I have to use the remote all the time.  The microphone is pretty strong, but there's also no way to adjust the levels to ensure you don't miss a word.  Overall, this is a decent purchase if you are on the fence, it's a lot of money and it's not portable so it's hard to use with the S3 when you can't bring the phone with you.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to monitor my computer activity. I like to have some way to see what my computer is up to. It works, but it is a pain in the ass. The cord is too short to plug into a computer. It needs to be longer to fit in a computer case. The battery life is not that great. After a day of heavy usage, it would die after 2-3 hours of watching a movie or browsing the web. The unit takes up too much space in my case. It has been in the same spot for about two months. The only saving grace is the fact that I still have the old version.

The best thing about it is the fact that it comes with two speakers, one at the top and one on the bottom, and you can switch them out at will.   When I first got it, I was a bit confused at how this thing would sound and I was really looking forward to playing music, but then I realized that I had to plug in two headphones to get the sound I wanted.  The batteries are not as long as I would like them to be, so it takes a while to charge.  My only problem with it is that the buttons don't always work as I expected.  They are sometimes difficult to push and sometimes just stop working altogether.  I've also been running into problems with it playing music over Bluetooth (when my Bluetooth headset is plugged into my computer), which I can only assume is because it does not support the older Bluetooth standards.  When it is playing over Bluetooth, you can hear the music pretty well, but if the music is loud, you get a lot of background noise from the speakers.  Other than these things, though, I would highly recommend this device! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing that I would like to change is the volume control. When you press it, it's so loud that it's very irritating.   This phone is cheap and loud   I'm not a huge fan of plastic, and I hate the buttons, but these plastic buttons are super annoying and hard to use.  I feel like there's a lot more that could be done with this device, and the "gift card" was a good idea, but the app is a total disappointment.  The sound is okay, but I feel that the mic could be louder.  These are not cheap phones for the price. If you want a nice little phone for your phone money, this is not it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought my first wireless speaker because the speakers sound great on my iPhone 6, but the sound on this thing is so disappointing. I purchased this speaker because of the sound quality of the speakers for my iPod, but I can't speak for the sound from my iPhone. There are some cool features, but you really need to spend the extra $40 to get the best sound quality out of this thing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i bought my first pc a few years ago, i ended up with an ipod that took forever to charge and then stopped.  When it finally charged, it would only hold up to an hour. So I had to buy a new ipod just for the music.   If i had bought this for my ipod,  I would have gotten a better product for my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The key problem with the BOL-303 is the very thin and delicate plastic cover that covers the power switch. The button is also made of the same thin plastic and so its only good when the device is completely covered. This is a problem that has been known to happen when the BOS-303s are used in the field. The cover also makes the device not easy to clean out when in the back pocket where other electronic devices like to get out of. In the same time, you can not keep the battery very charged either. I have to charge it almost every day. If you are the type who likes to take your battery with you when you go on a hike, then this is probably not the model for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my old laptop so I could do my writing on the iPad. Well I bought the wrong thing because the price of the item was higher than expected. First of all it doesn't charge. I can't connect it to a charger as the tablet is too low. Also if you plug it in you have to unplug it from the charger. I thought about buying a cheap computer because my old one was really broken.   But now it doesn\'t work and it costs so much more than the cheap one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is OK, but the touch controls are bad and the battery is low. I have read many reviews on the best battery life on a phone. For an old Nokia phone, the battery life is OK. I can charge the battery a couple of times with no problem. The phone is a tad slow with it's touch input, but once it gets going, I am impressed. The battery life may be good for an old phone, but not for an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. I would consider the battery to be low-quality.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I used this device, I used it to power a computer, a wireless keyboard, and a mouse, as well as a small projector. While not as powerful as a wireless projector, it is still pretty powerful. I had been considering this device in the past, but had just come up against the price of $349.99, so I decided to try it out. First I tried with my Mac Mini. It connected, but the mouse wasn't responsive. But after installing a driver I was able to get it to work. I did have to change the power cable to a longer one, as the one that came with my computer wasn't long enough. But otherwise, it worked perfectly. I also used it with my laptop and it connected, albeit a bit less than I would have liked. The only issue I have is that the power LED indicator light doesn't blink very quickly. After a few seconds it doesn't even blink. However, I still found that I could play back music from my computer. After doing so, I tried to use the projector (not a huge deal, as I have it facing the wall), but the projector didn't turn on. I tried running my own setup program, which worked just fine, so the connection problem must have been something to do with the software. Still, it's a nice little device.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a smartwatch about a month ago and really liked it...until I lost the battery in about a week and a half...I've tried buying a new one and am having to return the one I purchased because the one from walmart is too heavy and has to be plugged in...I don't mind the strap, it's nice and soft, I like that I can put it on when I'm in a rush without worrying about it slipping off. I love that my phone isn't in my pocket all the time, that's always a problem I have with my old watch. However the thing is hard to read in bright light, I've tried a lot of different apps and nothing works, and my watch is falling apart, it has two buttons which I don't like but it's a watch right? I'm not sure if I'm going to buy another...but I don 't have the money to buy a second one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â - The touch screen is horrible - the screen is so small and has a small font size, which makes it very hard to understand what you're doing. - It doesn't have a volume control. - Battery life is awful. - Bluetooth is really bad, you can't use it without the phone. - The screen is a bit waxy, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the device is actually pretty good.   - Â  The touch display is so tiny, it is really hard to read your text.  Â  - The speakers are very loud - if you don't have headphones, they're the worst thing I've ever heard! -Â  The keyboard is actually a bit awkward, but you can use the trackpad on the left side of the screen as a pointer.Â   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It has a big battery and a small one is still fine (for a phone). The buttons are small and the back of the phone is curved so it's harder to type. However, the battery life is great. And it's cheap.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    We bought this keyboard because our old ones didn't work. We ordered this model in July and the keyboard was sent out in August. It is a bit larger than our old one, but it was still nice to be able to put this size into our hand and use it for a month straight. However, the key travel is a lot less than our others, which may or may not be a problem depending on how fast you type. The keys are a little loud, but they're still usable and typing on it is fine. This keyboard was a great purchase for us and would recommend for anyone looking to buy a good looking electronic keyboard for under $100.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Read the entire review here.  $1.33 per month. A few of us are paying $4.00 for monthly and $5.00 per month so we can listen to the radio. This does not sound like a lot for the amount of time you will be listening to a radio station. They have been out of business for a while, so maybe I was expecting something a bit more high end. This is an inexpensive way to keep track of local stations. I would recommend a different station and maybe a different digital source, or better yet, listen to our radio in my car.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The Samsung Galaxy Tab is a wonderful tablet that I have enjoyed using. It has everything you'd expect from a smartphone: a display that is very bright, easy to read in almost any light, and quick responses to taps and swipes. However, I have had many issues. I have tried to return a number of times to get a replacement or a refund, but Samsung refuses to allow it. They even refuse to exchange it for me. I cannot give it 5 stars because of the problems I have, but my review is a negative of the products as a whole.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     You have a really great design, but there are so many things that could be improved, such as:  1) The screen is too small and is impossible to see in the dark;  2) The keyboard is a little small and the arrow keys are too hard to press;  has a great design for the price, but if your computer has better specs then this should be higher.  This product is very high quality, but has a number of small flaws.  is a well-built, high-quality, and reliable gaming keyboard.   The screen may not be clear enough for all uses, and this could have been improved by making the display bigger, especially when playing a game on a TV or using it for watching video. The arrow keys have a high-speed mechanism, and may be a little difficult to press. If you have experience with gaming keyboards, this would be a good keyboard for you. This product is not very comfortable to use, as there are too many parts and they are very fragile.  If you use this for watching videos, or playing games on your computer then this would not be a problem, but it should be rated higher because of its fragility.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - I don't recommend this product. The first thing that went wrong with my purchase was that the screen came off! The second thing was the camera. I would not buy this again. (Posted on 6/12/15)  Excellent product, customer service excellent! Review by dave Quality Value Price Service I purchased two of these units to work on my desktop computer for my business. These units are built solidly and the screens are excellent for displaying files on the computer. They even come with one of the most helpful and knowledgeable support groups I have seen anywhere in the computer industry. My last order from here came with an excellent warranty. Thanks for your continued business. (I will be back. Thanks again, David!) (Posted On 3/17/15 )  Good unit, bad purchase! Review, by D.W. Quality Value Service This is a very nice looking unit. The build quality is solid. There is a few things, however, that I donï¿½t think they should be proud of. 1. You cannot attach the power cable to the USB 3.0 port. The cable must be soldered to it. 2. I have had no luck in getting the camera to work properly. I am unable to use it to take still photos. (The included instruction manual is not useful.) The instructions also tell you to power off the unit when it is no longer in use (but I canï¿½t get it to do that). It appears that they have not really considered the cost that it would have taken to develop, produce, and ship a new unit. (As a side note: I have also had some other issues with my units. They will sometimes not turn on when you plug in their own power supply and if you plug the camera into your computer directly it may be slightly damaged). Overall, these are nice units and I will continue to use them. (Just like with my previous two units, the cable connection is not a deal-breaker because it is a small issue and I never have to deal with it.)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great piece of equipment, but it does have some flaws. First, it is a bit over-sized for a keyboard replacement: It fits my Apple Keyboard perfectly, but there are two places where the rubber on the underside of the keyboard (which the unit comes with) doesn't quite fit.   So, if you have an Apple Keyboard, you may not have this device in the first place. Second, the screen quality was really bad on this device: Very little contrast.  Yes, you can use it at night, but I never would. It's just too dark, so I can't see what I am typing in. It would have been really nice to have some kind of light behind the screen (I don't think this is a problem with this model, but if you happen to be using the Mac Book Pro with a larger screen, you might have problems, too). Third, the software is very confusing and has a lot of confusing menus: The interface is pretty confusing for beginners and it is hard to keep track of all the different functions of all these different functions.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My Sony Ericsson K550 is horrible and its been over 2 months now. I bought it on Black Friday in December for $650 off contract. Its just never worked right for me and when i finally broke it it had all the buttons and switches and all the features disabled. When i decided to sell it, i was a bit surprised to see that no one had a working unit. It is in need of a new battery, but its still functional but it does not have the features I need or the features i paid for. This device is not worth $650.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     "I love the sound quality and the compactness of the unit. I've always been a fan of the "T-Shirts" that come with the unit, and I like the look of it. I'd really like to get some of these units with a full set of cables. It's a little weird that the cable for the mic on the left side is a standard RCA. Why is that? If you want to use a microphone with the mic preamp, then you can't use a mic cable on the right side for the preamp. I'm a little annoyed because of the cable issues, but if you don't need a mic, I can live with it. There isn't any reason to not have both audio/mixed/digital/PCM options." "I love your product. But the unit isn't waterproof. So it can be used in the rain, but you should be prepared to take it apart and repack it." " I don't know what you are talking about, because this is the only sound card I've ever used and I've owned hundreds of audio units. So I'm not sure how you can tell, but I didn't experience any noise at all with the Mic preamp attached to the Soundcard, and with the microphone plugged into the card. The sound quality was superb for the money." "The unit does exactly what it is supposed to do. The only problem is that the usb plug for the digital output isn't long enough. I had to run a mini-jack to it, but the mini-plug had to be mounted a little further down the board so that the other two USB ports are at the bottom. This makes it difficult to use with a microphone, so I've decided to upgrade my soundcard." "Great product, I have it in the studio and will probably buy it soon for my mobile/car/other rig. Very pleased!" "This was my first "professional" audio product and I am impressed. I used a different USB DAC on the computer which sounded great in my PC but then my iPod and external sound system were starting to get out of hand. I bought this to replace my iPod (which had terrible sound quality) and I'm happy to report that it is fantastic. The analog audio to digital conversion is perfect, the microphone sound is great and it runs on batteries so I can use it all day long." "This product is fantastic! Very fast
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You could have done better with this product. I have only had this unit for about a month. So far the issues I have had with it are: - the speaker is way too close to your body to the body of the mic so it is hard to hear - it has no volume control (this is a nice feature on other products but is not necessary on the L-1000) - the volume is so low that you can't even hear the song you are listening to - the USB is so slow and has no way to connect and disconnect so you are constantly moving it back and forth and it just doesn't work well as a USB hub.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You would like to be able to play your favorite music, but don't because of a bad set of speakers or headphones? Well, just get an   new   pair of speakers/headphones !   We have the finest speakers on the market - not to mention   wireless Bluetooth speakers! You won't regret buying them! The only problem is that when you get these speakers, you also get a pair of earbuds (you will need to purchase   another pair of  earbud ) for just  $39.95 -   Why wait when you can purchase this product   from the website -  and it is even shipped to you for free (free shipping is included in the price of the product)!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I bought this, and after a few minutes of waiting the screen froze for 2-3 minutes and then restarted itself. I took it back, tried it with a different usb cable, it froze again, and then it reboots. I have no clue what was the problem, because it always reboots and always has wifi and wifi hot spot and everything is working fine.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Nice product I needed a router for my home and wanted something that had a good range and no cable run required. This worked out really well. The only issue is that the cable length is too short. I purchased this cable from a store and was hoping it would be longer. But since it's not longer, it just sits in my hand when I try to connect. Not the end of the world, but still an issue.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just used my new laptop for a week or so, using it mainly for gaming, reading email, watching videos and surfing the web. I'm extremely impressed by the performance of the processor, the video output (I use an external display), the speakers and the keyboard. It is fast and responsive. When I purchased this computer I was so happy with the price (it cost me $500!) that I could not believe my good luck. However, I was very disappointed when I plugged it into the wall and it began to get extremely hot, and the fan was blowing very hot air. This computer has never had a problem before. It will not be replaced. I hope my experience is not typical.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Bunk from Not perfect, but great for a home office or work computer I love my HP Z24x Workstation, but the battery life is terrible and it was never very reliable, not even when my laptop died on me, it would turn on and it would be dead for hours (at least 5) and I'm pretty sure I just ruined a good hard drive by letting it die on me. So I replaced the battery in my Z24t and had to replace it in my HP Workstation. I've got it now, it's a very good machine, but I just can't recommend it as a general purpose computer for a office or home. If you need something to do general work and can't afford a laptop then the Z24 is a great choice and for the $500 it is pretty decent in my opinion, but don't expect a super laptop, it might be, but this is what I use it for.

As a matter of fact, I went out to get some music, and these had a noticeable improvement in sound quality compared to the last pair of earbuds I had.

When I ordered the product, I was told that I could change the color of my LED light. I decided that I would just leave the blue/green color. When I received the product the first thing that I noticed was that the button on the bottom wasn't working. The LED wasn't blinking.  I had to try several times to make sure that the LED was working.  This product should come with a better warranty.  The reason I don't have any problems with the unit is because I have a 3 year warranty from this company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I can say it works great, but there's something about it that is just not right.  I got it in the mail today and ran into a problem that I had not realized, until now. The phone would occasionally switch off.   When I tried to reboot it, it would just reboot over and over, over andover, over.  It even had a hard reboot right before the UPS arrived.  The reason it would switch off, was because my computer (I have Windows XP) was in sleep mode.  So if I would try to get it to boot from a USB drive, I would get it in this very odd condition, where the computer would just keep booting over and doing this over and then over again for like a month straight.  This has never happened before.  When it did boot, the boot time was about 1 minute and 5 seconds. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is a good gadget with some serious flaws that have plagued this company for years. I bought this on a whim after hearing the rave reviews about the $5.99 batteries and charging, and the battery seems to be fairly decent. But when you plug in the charger and connect the charger to the battery and the phone, you discover this thing is not designed for charging electronic devices. The device automatically shuts down (i.e., when the phone is connected) and when you turn the device back on, it goes into standby mode, which can take more than 2 hours to fully charge a cell phone. The phone battery lasts for about 12-15 hours, but even a good phone battery can get drained fast, and this thing can't even charge a good one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The "P" shaped USB-A to USB-C connector is a dead end (no longer used), and the cables are so bad that you will not be able to use the cable on anything. The USB ports are small and thin and don't allow the full capacity of USB 3.0. For a company that makes a lot of cheap devices, I expect a bit better, but the USB 3 ports are only a bit larger than the USB 2 ports. They are also a little stiff in comparison to the ones on my Galaxy S4, and the buttons are very difficult to press. I would advise that you don't buy this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â I have been using this for a couple weeks now, and I'm very pleased with it. The only problem I've had so far is the charging dock not getting full charge (although I'm using it off a USB 2.0 port, I have a 5 port USB hub that I've been using with the dock).   Â  This is a minor issue, and probably isn't worth a review, but I'll still say that I would buy this again.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed was how bad the battery life was. The battery life of the XM-L2 is really great for the price.   But I have to agree with a reviewer who said "there's a reason this isn't a top-of-the-line phone. This thing has a very poor battery life. The phone does have a very bright display and a good camera, but the battery performance is pretty atrocious".   I'm glad I've found a replacement for my XM S. It's much cheaper than the XP and works great. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really thought this was a nice idea and I really liked the idea. However, I found the user interface a little frustrating. I could tell how the device was performing pretty easily and could tell the differences in the quality of the music. Unfortunately, this device isn't a good way to listen to audio while on a computer. It's good for listening to music and you can use it on your phone or tablet as well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased an iPad 3 for my daughter as a Christmas gift and after an hour with the tablet, she decided to put it down and get something else. I thought to myself, "Damn, I thought it was the best thing that ever was." Then, after reading the customer support emails, I found that the iPad 3 (the one I received) had a software problem that could not be repaired, so I had to return it. I do not know how long it would take for Apple to fix this problem, but hopefully they do!  Review of DJI Mavic 2 (for Phantom 3 Pro) - by Adam on November 20, 2013.   Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had high expectations for the new Lenovo Yoga Tab 4 Pro, considering it was supposed to be better than its predecessor.   The Tab 4 has been a long time coming.  The specs have improved, but at the cost of being bulky.  I would have preferred a smaller, lighter body, but a smaller body has never been more impressive in the mobile arena.  It's a shame, as the battery life was quite good, but with this many ports, it's still difficult to fit into a tight spot.  In the end, it does all I want from a tablet, and I'm glad I was able to buy one, but there are just some things that could have been improved upon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the Sony PS3 and it came in 2 days. The computer itself is nice and has everything I need. The PS3 has been so reliable and has worked without issue for the last 2 years. It runs very smooth and is very easy to upgrade. The only problem with the PS3 is the lack of a USB port. I purchased the Sony Playstation 2 and it was a bit of a disappointment. The controller for that is a bit clunky and the computer does not have USB ports. Also, the Playstation 2 had a better built and a larger hard drive. The console is a step back from the PS1 which I really loved. I will be picking up a PS3 later this year and will have to have the computer. The graphics were very dated when I first got it but have improved to the point where I am satisfied. If the graphics have gotten any better I am sure there would be far less complaints from people. I have had the computer 4 months and still do not have a way to transfer the music from the computer to my phone. I can use music files from the internet but no way to stream them.  Rated 5 out of 5 by gbk from Very good! I use this computer with an older pc and have had a few hiccups so far. The unit runs very cool and has been very reliable. I also like the fact that this computer is USB based. My only negative is the fact it only has 1 USB port so you can only charge the device when you are actually connected to it. This makes charging the device much slower than if you had more ports. . ,  ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am using my new laptop for a couple of weeks now. It is awesome, but there's one thing I don't like about it, that's how fast the memory is...it's so slow. I bought the first 8GB version, that came with the laptop, and the 32GB version. Now I have a problem, because after 10 hours of use, the first time I try to play my games on my second monitor, there's not enough ram for it. The second time, I had to go through the process of buying another 8GB. I know that there are two problems here, one is how slow the memory (or the processor) is, but it is an obvious design flaw and another is that this laptop is not able to be upgraded easily (for example, the RAM needs to be swapped in the machine itself). I do want to recommend the laptop if you're looking for a high-end one, but this is something that I can not trust, if you can upgrade it, I recommend you.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The device was easy to set up. However, it is a little difficult to turn on and off.  Rated 4 out of 5 by James from Easy to Use I wanted to be able to quickly play music on my ipod, as well as connect to my TV. This worked perfectly for this. I had to use a small flat head screwdriver to turn it on to turn off. I could turn the lights off and it was still working. It was a little tight to put the plug in but that was a minor problem. I would definitely recommend. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (I bought a digital watch, it had an "auto stop" function which meant that when I opened the watch, the watch shut off itself. The watch only has 4 functions. The only thing I wanted was to be able to check the time, because I was running late to work, so that I didn't forget. I was able to "pause" the watch on my phone. This is not a good solution. A phone would have been much better. I wish this watch was made by a quality company, with a great warranty. This watch is cheap, and cheap doesn't mean good!  5/5 Great little watch Review by Peter Quality Value The best small watch I've owned. It's small, sleek and good for day to day use, but does have the capability to keep time in case you do need it.  2/5 The watch has a tiny beeping sound and the battery life is awful. Review by D.D. Quality Value This watch does not give the same time as the larger watches and it is so weak and buggy that you may need a battery to keep it alive. The battery is a terrible problem. I keep this on my keychain and forget to put it down when I leave my house, and I go back in a couple of days. If you have to use this watch a lot, put a battery in it or buy a real watch. ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I've owned a number of digital watch apps over the years, and the current Pebble Time does not appear to be improving upon the last generation. For a $35 timepiece, the watch is very basic. The main screen shows a lot of white, but that may just be the white backlight, and I found that the colors look better in the dark.

It will work with any screen resolution as long as it has a refresh rate of 60hz. If you have to have a 30 fps or 60 fps screen (that's a plus for me), you would be looking at a much more expensive set up. For the price, this is really good.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â   Â The product works fine until you take the battery out.   When you remove the battery from the case and pull out the USB cable, you need to pull the cable out of the connector.  My friend took out the battery for me and pulled the cable and tried to plug it back in.  It won't fit into the connector or it won't come out of there. I guess he just can't take the time to get the cable into the slot.  I wouldn't even know if this was a good product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A great product for the price... but don't buy it expecting the ultimate in design and features!   The price has gotten way up and the phone is no longer as slick as it used to be.   With that said, I love the touch screen.  My friends and I still talk about that day we were all blown away...   It still takes photos fine and looks good for the money.  Â   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What a terrible phone. First it started to die just as it was being delivered. This was on the day of a test drive. And when it was taken out to be replaced with a new one after it died on me the first time, it came with 2 batteries that needed to be changed after about 5 hours. And after about 3 months of my time, I still had to call tech support to get my new one working, and still get disconnected at every stop sign or stop light. The screen is really scratchy. And I've seen similar problems in other people's units. It's only good for playing music. I've had to keep it in my pants pocket because it's so small. Other than that, it's not worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They do work well, but they do require you to be on your toes all the time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my first electronic device, and this isn't even the end of it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device is not what it claims to be. It is a flimsy product. The speakers are very cheap. I have no way to get the sound out of it. It's just a glorified walkman. The buttons are too difficult to use. I would not recommend this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â I've owned a few of these things and they really just don't work for me.   I hate the fact that you can't simply just pick up the phone on your way to work and you will have a device that allows you to work remotely.  This is a horrible way to interact with a computer.  The battery life is terrible and I've found that it doesn't last for more than 30 minutes on a single charge.  I bought this because it was advertised as being able to send a fax and it did.  I also bought this to connect a printer to my home PC.  After I installed it, it took some effort to configure my printer and get it working with my PC. I eventually got it working, but it wasn't easy.  And last, but not least, the device is completely useless.  It does nothing.  My friends tell me that if you are in need of faxing or anything remotely related, this is a good product to get.  But other people love this thing.  Now to the good:  The price is reasonable compared to similar products.  Its size makes it easy to hide in your bag.  So what's not to love about this device?  It's simple design is appealing to some and frustrating to others.  When you are doing something as simple as sending a fax, the fact this device can't be attached to your laptop makes it hard to use.  There are some great features about this gadget but its lack of functionality and limited availability can't justify the price.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone with a need to send or receive a fax remotely. It works if you're in a rush but you'll definitely regret the time you spent with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing you notice about the device is its size. I thought about trying to replace my smartphone with this one, but I was a little nervous that this may be too big for my hand, but it was not so big that I couldn't operate it with both hands. I tried using it with my right hand and a small pad of paper, and it worked very well. I'm not an advanced user, but most of the buttons seemed to respond well. One of my major gripes about the previous version of this device was its "jiggle" noise when it switched from its rechargeable battery mode to its solid state one. The newer version (which I also tried) was quiet.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I was using the i7-3960x for about a week, which lasted about 1 week. Since the CPU has not been changed, I have not yet tested for stability with this version. I have had a similar model with the cpu and the memory clocked at 3000 MHz and 2GB of ram for about 3 weeks. This is about half the price.  Noise and heat in both modes:  You will hear a very faint hum if you use the loudest settings, and there is a little bit of heat. The fan can be turned off, but is still a bit loud. I would not recommend it unless you are using it on a desk that you are comfortable using your computer on. The back plate on this thing is a bit cheap, but it does protect the components and the aluminum in the case. I like the black aluminum finish. If you plan to run this thing, get the cooling fan. Otherwise, you could go with a simple, cheaper laptop. "The Asus G752JK's keyboard is good. The keys feel good and are responsive, with the exception of some keys being quite stiff and others having good travel. The keyboard is fairly spacious and has decent travel, though I'd prefer a full sized keyboard with some keys having the travel that this has. The included numeric keypad is reasonably sized and has a nice layout. The volume buttons work well. The mouse buttons work great, and the touchpad is excellent." - Steve W.,  "This machine was a great value when I bought it last year. I'd recommend this machine to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced (for the size) and good performing laptop. The Asus G751J is the perfect desktop replacement for me." - Jeff A.,  in the UK"The battery life is fantastic!" - Nick H., , I used this as my desktop replacement, the keyboard was great. It had all the features I wanted in a good keyboard, even if I do have some quirks in my typing - mainly a bit of a delay between letter strokes. I got a good deal on it - around Â£150-Â£180.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound of this device is not great. It's clear that the engineers did not spend much time on the acoustic part of this.

The only way is by twisting it, or by holding it down for 10 minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I was in high school I bought a portable music player in a small box and I loved it. I have played it over and over again ever since. It has never died once. Unfortunately, in about 3 years of use, the internal speaker and its accompanying cord started to deteriorate and it was time to go back to my previous portable player. This one is a HUGE downgrade. The bass is weak and the treble is very harsh, especially the upper midrange. The sound of the speaker is not too great either. I don't see much point in using this on a bus or while driving another vehicle, but it might be good for those looking for a "compact" music player, especially those who do not have much room for a larger portable player in their car. I'll leave this review here as my general opinion on this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It has been the worst device ever. Every part broke at least once. There was never a guarantee that the device would actually be able to send out the messages or the data in the first place.

Yes No Friday, June 25, 2015  I have been using this for almost 2 years  by Lacey from Phoenix AZ USA  Review: I bought this a month ago and I was really happy with the initial purchase. But I had to cancel a month later. I tried to call customer service and they told me to email, but when I called it was disconnected. I have emailed them three times. So, I decided to send them a picture and they sent me a refund. I called them today to check on the status of the refund and again no response. I will be calling them back this weekend. So far I love the product but I am really unhappy with this customer service. I had a problem that I was supposed to be fixed for the last 3 months.   the same model is very hard to get on the road in. so if you have a vehicle with the old version, you will have a hard time getting the device on. so don't bother buying it. I also want to mention the device works great in the vehicle. but it is hard to find it on the dashboard when you go to start the car. It makes the dash look like a garbage can. And they don't have the option to put the USB in the dash as it is on the top of the dash.  Was this Review helpful to you?" "

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone is cheap and works well with no issues. Only reason why I gave it 2 stars is due to poor design that make it hard to use for long time. I was also concerned about the phone's battery life because there is a built in clock/timer and it takes 2-3 hours to fully charge the phone, and then the phone takes about 15-20 minutes to fully discharge the battery. I think it's a waste of money to purchase a phone that has no features that help to keep the battery from draining and it has such a low battery life. Maybe someone can find a way to make the battery last longer and it would be worth the extra cost, but this is a phone to be used with a portable battery pack.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a Toshiba portable digital music player with a bad, scratchy sound. It works fine, and has been great in the car. I have listened to music on it and heard some very nice bass. However, when I want to listen to music, it takes forever to play a CD and the sound is poor. I purchased this product for my son so he can listen to the radio, and listen to his music in his car. His car stereo is horrible, so he's really excited to get this player. The player is not very good. It has a very bad scratchy CD player sound, and is almost impossible to use when listening to music.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Ceejay from Worst product I have ever bought! This thing does not work. It's very loud and almost no sound at all. I guess I was expecting much more but it's a waste of money to me. I am going to keep the player for my iPod but I won't be purchasing this one again. I was going to buy one because it was close and cheap. But I am never buying this kind of stuff ever again. . The worst thing I've ever purchased. It is so loud that it blocks out the car radio. It makes music a bit muffled and it will only play the CD when you have the phone or iPod on. I'm not sure if I'll use this once or twice or 3 times, but I just want to say to other people don't waste your time and don't buy this. It won't hold a charge because it's so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this charger on a whim a few days ago. I was just about to get an EVGA G2 1000W but they are out of stock so I decided to wait. This charger is sooo fast to charge up my gtx 1070. I just put it in my pc, the power light stays lit and the charging light is green all the time so no worries about the charging indicator. No need to turn off power at all when charging. The only downside is I wish the button had the light instead of being a blue LED. Also the cable feels cheap. But I still give it 5 stars because I still have a gtx 970 that I bought about 6 months ago that it works perfectly on and it will last me a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The key is to hold it up to the light and look at it from various angles. The fact is, the keys are very small and you need to keep your wrist at a 45 degree angle (like a tennis racket). Also, there are several areas where the key feels very mushy, but I can't see that it's any worse than other keys. I don't get the benefit of "gaming" keys, and I'm not really able to hold down a hard key for more than a few seconds while typing. I also haven't experienced any of the micro-switches problems you can get with other keys, which are also often mushy (I haven't tried them either). I can think of a few times when I need a key to click at the end of the sentence when my finger is already touching the keys. But most of the time, the actuation of the key doesn't feel nearly as fast as my WASD keyboard or my Logitech MX.   It's a very good mechanical keyboard, but it's definitely a small and unrefined design. It isn't perfect, but for $79, you could buy a Logitech that feels very good and costs half the price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I do when buying a new tablet is buy a different operating system so I don't have to get up from the bed. I am not really a tech person and this device is not very intuitive in that it seems to have almost no user friendly interface. I had a problem with one of the bluetooth speakers not being very loud which was a great way to kill a battery. My other complaint is the battery. I purchased this at Wal-mart for $45. The day it arrived I got a text from my husband telling me he took it from the shop and put it in a drawer for 3 days and he is still waiting to get it back. The battery in this thing is crap! When I had it out with me in the back of the truck I could hear it die after 10 minutes. I'm just going to wait until someone else gets one until I find out if it is really that bad or just my phone. It also has a very cheap looking screen with a black background and horrible sharpness. I wish the screen on this tablet was better than the screen of my Kindle.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There were some issues with the bluetooth that caused the device to disconnect from the speaker and when I reconnected the device, the speakers had problems getting back on.   My main issue is the speaker is loud enough but the quality is not great and doesn't sound as well as some of the other speakers on the market.   The new Koss PortaPro 6-Port Speaker System is a must have if you have a music lover in your home, especially if you use your home theatre system.  I use the Koss K-500 and the K-150 as my main home theatre systems and the Porta Pro 6-port speakers are the best I've heard in those systems and are much better in sound quality.  The K-5 is the best speaker of the KOSS speakers and is a lot smaller, but is the same price as the Portapro 6-ports.  Best of all, I was able to buy both speakers online at a price cheaper than any other online seller and they came within 2 weeks of ordering. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought the MZP2i it was supposed to be a replacement for the old EMT-P1 and I couldn't be happier with it. It is a good product and I am happy with it in general. It has been very durable and has survived my travels around the world.   I don't know where to go next as this is the only MZ product I have purchased so far, but it seems like a good device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     A good product, but...  I purchased this product to replace my old laptop. It is amazing that I could replace my entire computer, including the CPU, RAM, motherboard and power supply all in one package! The only downside is that it has two hard drives, instead of one. Also I have a laptop that I bought before this one. The old one is running great, the new one just keeps getting hotter and hotter. It's time for a new one!  In Summary  Great product, very solid build and design. It runs on the same power as my current system. If you are an enthusiast, this is the perfect upgrade. The only thing I would change is if I could get the power switch on the back of the device so that the USB ports would work with my current USB cable. If I could do that I think I would be all set.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My old Dell laptop that I had since 2007 failed after only 1 year of normal use. It did it's job until it got completely out of the water.   I have now replaced my entire computer (including my old HDD) and my friends have one too.  I've tried everything I could to upgrade the hard drive, but the problem was too many errors and it was becoming difficult to upgrade. I am very disappointed with this product and the tech support didn't help me at all. This is my 4th computer, I hope to have nothing like this on my next upgrade.  I have a Dell Inspiron 1030 that I bought in '09. This one also failed within 6 months. It took a trip to Best Buy and a few hours online to figure out that this is a Dell issue and that the laptop was sold with the faulty RAM. This laptop is still going strong and I'm using it to work on an assignment for the class I teach at a college in California.  My mother and I have had this same Dell machine for over 6 years now and it always has worked without a problem.  It's a 15" laptop, so it can handle a fair amount of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My MacBook Pro was purchased and has been using for almost a year. It has been fine until one day it stopped working and there was no way to get it back to work. It's not that the battery was dead or anything but it had a dead switch. I have had a similar problem with my Apple TV 2 a couple of years ago. I had to send it in for repair and it is not the first time, but I'm glad that I kept it.   It's a great device.

The battery was dead after a couple months and the screen kept going dark for about 30 minutes before it would turn on again. I have had it about 2 weeks. I am so glad I didn't buy it. I will be trying my luck with another vendor.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If I'm a student, I will take a good quality product and a bad quality device   I have two issues with this keyboard:  *   The layout of the keys on this keyboard is very strange. There is one key that has two little keys on it, and a lot of key that have a "hole". Some of them are quite small, and they don't click well. It takes a long time for the keys to click in this way, and I can't use any of them. The other big problem I have is that the volume control is way too slow. I get the same volume that I get with a laptop with this.  * Some of the key caps are very cheap. For example, the Enter key is made of a thin piece of plastic. It's very difficult to use, and it's a cheap quality. The arrow keys are also cheap. I don't like the keys being that close to the bottom of the keyboard, so I end up having to force them down by hand. The Num Lock key is also cheap - it's not clicky and it doesn't do anything at all. You can click it, but it's kind of useless.   Overall, this keyboard does its job, but I would not recommend it to a person who is not a computer expert.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not great at all! Not a keyboard fan, but my sister-in-law has a very similar machine that is nearly identical. However, this one has way too many keys with tiny holes. In addition, it does not have a USB cable included. The only thing the other model does have is a full-sized USB port on the left side for charging. The keyboard itself is a little difficult to type on (the buttons don't have a consistent feedback, and the key cap spacing is just right).  Review of DJK-1800X - This is the worst cheap keyboard I have ever purchased. The switches are so terrible, so bad, the keyboard has become virtually unusable. In fact, I would use a $10,000 USB keyboard to type my entire life. But what really took my breath away was the horrible clicky noise. My son is typing a letter on this thing and the mechanical "click" is not there. It is a bit scary to think what the clicky would do if I ever hit the wrong key. It does have a mouse port
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They don't have an inbuilt battery backup. I am lucky if I get two days of use out of them. The charger isn't that good and is expensive as well. This is a perfect case for your laptop. It can store your files and you don't even need the charger, just plug it in when you need to. They are pretty heavy and are not rechargeable. It's kind of disappointing because the case is really nice and the keyboard is really responsive.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was the worst purchase of my life...It's not an Apple product, it's a knockoff. Apple products have quality control that this one does not, there was no user guide, there is no warranty (I was told by tech support they do, but they do not follow through), there are hundreds of other knockoff devices on the market, there are even more knockoff accessories made for Apple, and it's impossible to tell where a phone is made...I paid a lot for a piece of junk. I'm going to take it back and tell the tech support people they better have the whole phone and not just the box to check out, or I'm calling my attorney.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this phone for 5 months before getting it replaced due to the screen falling off, also the back cover crack but I got it repaired. Now I wish i never used the phone as it was so bad, but I really love this phone. The phone itself is very good but the camera is so bad and the battery is really low. I have bought other android phones but when I use this phone it is like they can not do anything.   Rated 5 out of 5 by The JK from It's a fantastic phone I really like this phone and all of the features that are on it. When my LG G2 was replaced, I wasn't able to use the phone until I got the repair. This phone is definitely better than the LG G3 I was using at the time. I'm not a big fan of using the fingerprint reader since I don't have an actual touch screen but that's not the main reason I bought it.

The screen is a little soft, but I am just using it on my   Phone and it will be a while until I put it through its paces.   A big plus with this product is the price. It will be hard to beat this deal and it makes a nice holiday gift for anyone that enjoys a good product. The quality of this item is pretty good. As. You would expect.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone had a lot of problems. First of all it was a terrible design and quality, but then the manufacturer refused to fix the issues. They only provided a "repair" which consisted of the company's name and some vague description of the problem.  This is a great product. Its quality and functionality exceeds all of my expectations. It works well.   I have had my Galaxy S4 since August and love it.  I am not one to make big purchases, but this phone has been worth every penny. I have had no issues with this phone other than what the other reviewers have mentioned. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is a very good device, with great features. I like the idea of a battery operated "phone stand" where the phone sits on a shelf and the cord is connected to a wall outlet. It works very well and looks good too! The cable is cheap, but it works and looks great. I have two other phones that I have used for this purpose and they all work very well as phone stands, although the cord on my Samsung Galaxy S4 is longer, so it is harder to move it than the cord for the A6 and the A5. It is a good item and I like it for my job, although I wish there were two cords in one box. It should be possible to do this with a "phone holder" with a cord length that matches the phone model.  Style and quality of a phone stand:  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The worst problem I ever had with this device was the fact that the unit was not able to be used in any other country than USA.    It was a very easy process to get the package back to USA (as well as other countries that may be concerned about "the new kid on the block" ) and I am very satisfied  .  Rated 1 out of 5 by A.A from I ordered 3 sets for my son's birthday - the units arrived a few days late. The set... I ordered three sets for his birthday - of course there were delays as they got them from the factory. The units were fine - no problems - the problem was the delivery to my house. The first two sets arrived as new. The third set had a noticeable defect - one of the rubber grips broke. The owner said it was because the unit got stuck in a truck and he had to "pop it off" (without using the tools on the unit) to get it out of the truck. I am a trained electrician and I was able to repair it with a pair of pliers and some rubbing alcohol. I was also able to fix the problem with the replacement grip on my second set - with some sandpaper. I cannot return this set because I feel they have done a poor job with customer service. They should not be giving out a free unit because a single product is not up to the standard that they have set.  Product: Yes, the set works, but the quality and finish is unacceptable. I have an electronic outlet in my kitchen and this unit is very hard to operate. I'm also working in a space that is very small so the unit is hard to fit. The rubber seals on the terminals are not strong at all. It seems as though every time I use this unit I need to take it apart and put it back together. In addition, there is no adjustment screw on the device so the battery door is always open. The only positive thing about this set is the low battery warning light. The unit will not turn on and the buttons don't light up. When you first connect the unit it will show a status of "ON" and will display "ON". If you connect the device it will turn on but won't display the LED light. If you plug in the unit to a power source it will automatically turn on. If the unit turns off the light will still stay on even though the battery is depleted

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In general, I love my Apple iPhone 4S. However, I have had a few problems with it.   The back cover is so hard to open that it's almost impossible to get to all of the parts.  The touch screen has several glitches and bugs:  - The screen is very hot.  - Sometimes the touch screen will randomly freeze.  If your iPhone breaks, don't buy another one.  If you can't fix the problems, get rid of it. You will find cheap phones in stores. If your phone is completely dead, it's a good idea to get a new one. It can take two days to get parts. It will take much longer to get new iPhones. If you have any questions about an Apple product, contact Apple.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So after several weeks of playing with the new Apple TV, I just got an Apple TV 2 (6th gen) and decided I needed to give this one a try. So I ordered this unit yesterday, and I am extremely pleased with it.   Initially, I was a little disappointed in the Apple remote because of the way it was designed. The power button is on the bottom of the remote, and the Apple logo on the front is not the traditional red that is used for Apple products. I got the black model because I liked the feel of the silver color that is similar to the Apple Pencil.  I also thought the size of the screen was a bit smaller than the older model.  It comes with the remote that came with the 4th generation Apple TV.  The remote is much easier to use than the remote on the 4-year old model. The Apple TV has a new interface that is much cleaner than the old one. It also has a much larger interface than the previous Apple TV remote.  First impressions are good.  There is some lag on the Apple TV when selecting an input, but the lag is only 2 seconds when using the default input settings.  When playing a movie on the new interface, I noticed it played more slowly than the 4 year old model, but this could have been just my setup.  If I use a gaming remote, I find that it plays a little faster than the default remote. I also noticed that the 4 - year old remote uses the standard Apple remote buttons and button combinations.  Apple provides the Apple Remote App on the iPhone to add additional features to the new remote, but I didn't use it on the 6th gen model because it is the new design and I wanted the convenience of the new button layout.  With the Apple Controller, I think I will be buying the second generation remote, because the Apple controller interface is much more intuitive.  Overall, I am very pleased with the AppleTV. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new computer this past Friday, and upon opening it, the first thing that happened was a loud beeping sound coming from the main power button. This was followed by the battery getting charged, but not yet fully charged. After checking all of the connections and seeing that no matter what, the power did not turn on the battery would not charge. At this point I thought that perhaps the computer would run well enough without the battery, but the beeping kept going. The battery was being used up so I tried turning the computer off and on. Nothing. Finally, I took the computer outside and saw the same thing, and when I turned on the computer it did not charge, and the beep continued. Finally I called my computer company. They were very nice and apologetic and told me I would not be charged the fee for this "battery problem", but I would be issued a replacement battery for the computer. The replacement battery came quickly and I used it immediately, and everything worked perfectly. After the computer finally charged, the beeps stopped. I have been using my computer for a while, and do not have any other problems with the battery. I would purchase this product again. I highly recommend it to others.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tom from Excellent Product I have tried several different batteries for my iBook 2.5 (not in use anymore) and always have had the same issue. The first thing you notice is the beeper. The iBook has no battery. The beep is usually followed by a dead battery. Then you wait a week and the problem happens again. But this time it is not a dead one. This time it dies while the computer is running, which is not at all uncommon. I installed an aftermarket battery (not included) and it works fine. It is a good thing I am not a computer user. I use a cell phone to check e-mail and surf the web. It seems to work just fine.

Overall    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great little computer for the price I bought it a few months ago for a friend that needed a computer, so he can't go out and buy a new one, and also, this is an affordable option for someone looking to get into pc's but are unable to afford a new or refurbished computer. Works great. Not too bulky or heavy. Good build quality.  Thank you for providing this review.    I have owned a lot of computers over the years. I've owned Mac's, Windows PCs, and all sorts of computers. This computer is as close to perfect as they come. The operating system runs very smoothly and has not even had a reboot, which is a rarity for me. This is my first computer, and I am very happy with it.  at the price, I'm not sure I'd go out to buy a brand new computer, but if I had one, this would be the one. I would recommend this computer to everyone. I have a new iMac which is perfect for a basic office PC. However, I need a little more power and this little computer does the job with very little work on it. I use it as a desktop computer for work and I'm a heavy texter, so I use my laptop most days. I'm sure if I wanted to upgrade it to a 16Gb it would be worth it, but I'm just not that sort of person who wants a lot more power.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What I really like: The built in speaker is very nice and makes any of the tracks with it a little louder. The build quality is also very solid and no issues with the plastic parts. It's a simple design but feels very sturdy. I love that you can get a pair of the earbuds if you'd like but they are not the best value.   I don't really like them very much. The volume is really hard to get to high and the quality of the sound is really horrible. I'm using them on the car stereo which sounds great but the soundstage is so poor you can hardly hear anything. It makes the stereo very static sounding. Also, I have a good pair of earphones and have not been disappointed but I like having the bass in my headphones which the earphones don't have. Also the earhooks are cheap plastic and the wires are really flimsy so it's really hard getting the buds into my ears.  I'd rather spend a little more and get the earmuffs or a good set of stereo headphones.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I own three of these and have used them daily for the past two years. This thing, to be frank, sucks. If you're new to the whole USB charging scene, this would be a perfect device for you. However, I can't help but feel that it's being advertised to the "smart" market. USB ports are great, but with this one, you'll never know if the power is connected to the power adapter or to the wall outlet. And when that adapter runs out of juice, it literally sucks up the juice from your phone until it runs out. This is a must-have for the "experts" in charge of selling their devices.

The keystrokes are not clear and the user interface is a total mess. There is so much more potential for this product if the software was improved.

I bought this from BestBuy about 6 months ago.  This computer is a good laptop for its price.  It's really good for general purposes.  The only reason I gave it a 3 is because I feel like the keyboard is a little weak and the mouse isn't as good.  If the mouse would be better then I would give it a 4 or a 5.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought an eerily silent   i-PAD to use with my   PC.   It's really quiet!   There are a couple things I would change if I owned it   First, the buttons don't feel like they were designed to be used with a   small keyboard. Â Second, the   micro SD card slot is tiny.  Â  I can hold my  iPhone up to the slot and make it go from empty to full without any effort.  I'd love to know what you think about the PAD  The PAD is a good value:  This is a great, quiet and well built   product from   Epson.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â I have owned the iPad mini 2 for a little over a week and I can't even get it to boot up or show up to the website.   Â    I have had issues with my iPad Mini 3   before so I had high hopes for this model.  I was really excited to get this device when it was first released because the other one had a major fault.  When I purchased it the product was listed as having a one year warranty on the back panel so I thought I was getting a good quality product.  My first problem with the iPad Mini 2 is the charging port.  It is so small and so small in size that I can barely fit it in the case.  The first thing I noticed was that the case was loose on one side which was not an issue because I was able to adjust it.  Second problem I noticed is the small button on the side of the case that you have to press to turn it on/off.  That was a big problem because I like to turn on my device by pressing the button on my pocket knife.  However, if you press that button then it takes a lot of force to turn the device on.  There was a third and big problem.  This problem has happened to other owners of the iPad 2 so I am not sure if it is because of the model number or the fact that the mini was first launched so it is a newer model. The back panel does not screw on and it doesn't have a little tab to secure the back.  If the back didn't move in my pocket then I wouldn't even know that I had an iPad Mini.  Another problem is that the back case has a very small button that is a bit difficult to press.  But other than those issues I haven't had any issues so far.  Once I am past the initial issues I like the size and I have liked the fact it is smaller than my old iPad.  Now it is up to me to find a way to get it working.  So far, I have found that the new iPhone 5 is to blame for this issue.  Also I have noticed that the iPad 3 doesn't work as well as the iPad 4.  So now I am thinking of going back to the iPad Pro so I can keep my iPad 2.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      The original Eee PC is a classic!   I've owned the original, II and III (both are amazing computers) and the newest PC I got is amazing too!  If you don't have a good computer to work on, get one!  The only problem with the newer models (and i recommend the new II model) is that they have a crappy touch screen (like an iPod Touch with a screen that is half the size) and some of the older models have terrible touch screens so you have to switch to a keyboard or you can't use the touchscreen.   The Eee 2 is the most fun computer to use.  The new models are too slow.  My old PC is so fast now that I could have it working with a USB keyboard if they'd just make one.  Now that the older ones are so slow i just bought a new PC and have been happy with it for about a year now.  Eee PCs are great.  For $60, and up, they can be great computers.  If it's the PC i want, get a PC!  I just bought the new Eee Pc and I'm glad I did!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of the speaker for the price is awful. The sound is not very clear and you can't do a lot with a phone with this. The fact that the battery will die on the first charge of this phone is very frustrating. If you need a phone like this then wait till someone puts out a better phone, this one is just okay.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this item for a computer lab, and I am very dissatisfied with it. The main problems I had with this product: 1)   First off, this item did not come with a battery, which I found very disappointing as this is one of the many things I needed to do to keep the computer running.   2)  I did not feel like I was going to get any use out of it, as it did not include a monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers, and it did include a keyboard and mouse, but did not provide a power cord.  3)  The item does not include instructions on how to plug in the wires for the computer.  I had a great experience with my purchase of this item. The quality of the item was excellent, and the service I received was exceptional.  I am happy with my decision to purchase this item from the site. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i i i    This is a fantastic device. I love my new computer so much I bought another as well. The only problem is the mouse.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is very small and barely usable on the phone, and it lacks many other basic functions.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Tim from Nice touch! The screen on my Note 3 is very bright and crisp. The app support is good (I use Google Maps, etc.) but the app support for the Note 3 has been spotty, as other users reported. " The display is very good, so far I'm happy with it, I just wish it was a bit bigger and the touch responsiveness was better. "  Reviewed by: Daniel A. from South East Florida This is a very nice and bright display. As another reviewer pointed out, the app interface is not that good.  the only negative point I have is that on the screen there is no option for an extra tap in the menu.  and also, you can't have it show the battery level  I'm glad I bought this phone so I can use it more often. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 on a similar phone. It has a brighter screen and a few extra features. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had never played with one of these before I found this one. I liked how it felt in my hands, and how the buttons felt good, but the problem was the sound. It's very low. There is some "pop" when you press the power button, but not enough to bother me. I think the sound is what made it so appealing in the first place. If this thing could have been slightly louder, I would have been able to get a good sound from it.       I have tried a few other electronic devices, but I find this to be the best.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i hope that my previous comments of the bad sound of the iCX will not discourage you from buying it. iCx is a nice little keyboard and I am very impressed with the key travel. however the switch that controls the LED and the backlight is a bit flimsy and flimsy is a big word. once you press down on the back of the switch it starts to move and the light turns red but the backlighting is also out of control. you can only press it down until it reaches the end of the cable, but if you press it too hard or with too much pressure it will just break. the good thing is, with the cable broken you can simply put a different keyboard in your computer and the iLx will still function, it just won't light up when you're typing so well. the i4x and i3x however are a lot nicer to type on than the i3 and they're a lot more comfortable too. the keycap is also not as thick as the iMac. the keyboard also has a few features that I really like: - it has a function key that will bring up the battery power and sleep modes - you can change between 8 different colors on the keyboard (black, grey, blue, red, green, pink, silver, white) and even between two colors on each key if you're playing a game that doesn't have a built in backlight - there is a little LED light that will light up your monitor and keyboard when you push a key on the keypad - and last but not least: there is no floppy drive.   If you are a first time buyer of this keyboard then I suggest you buy the i1 or i2 instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I'm not a big fan of the Apple watch as an item that costs the same amount as a pair of running shoes, but as a watch that can show the time, it's a fantastic timepiece that I plan to use every day. That said, I had to buy one.   I bought one to go with the   Apple Watch .I'm a big  fan of  the Apple Watch and i want to buy more because it makes me more aware of my surroundings.  I'm not really impressed with  the display and is way too small to read in bright light. It also has a microphone but it's not clear enough for speech recognition to work. In addition to the display, the watch has no way of communicating with my iPhone via the 3G or LTE network, so I'm unable to view messages on my iPhone   that are sent to the watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I tried this for the first time on October 1, 2013, and I've already lost two sets, which is what I'm used to. The second one I picked up from Amazon has already malfunctioned, and the third will probably do the same. So I don't understand how this thing is being marketed as a "smartphone case" when it only has a 2-megapixel camera and a 2.1-megabyte hard drive.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm just going to come right out and say it: Â This thing is a piece of crap.   My old laptop died and I went through a lot of different options for replacing it.  I went with a Dell Latitude E6430, and this thing blew it away!   I was in the process of selling my old one at Goodwill when I found it. I picked up it on eBay for $40, and after a couple weeks of running around I can say the build quality is absolutely awful.  It is so flimsy that I have to wrap the thing in plastic because it has snapped off on a hard landing while I've been sitting on it. And, it breaks all the time!  It's not even a cheap computer, so you would think that the build is worthy of that price.  The touch screen isn't even accurate, the memory is not even expandable, and the keyboard is awful. Even if this thing was a $10, I'd rather have a refurbished laptop than this dongle.  This was the only computer that my mom actually uses, but it's still not a good one. I hope Dell decides to make their laptops better in the future.  Fully Functional.  With the screen off, the device was working well.  Â  The battery is great for a 10 inch laptop, and it's very compact.  A small and compact touch screen is not good in this situation.  If the screen was fully functional, the computer could have functioned like a tablet. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â My main concerns with my Nexus One (the version I got on a two year contract) are that: 1.   The camera is terrible, so I never used it to take pictures.  2.  There is no headphone jack, which means I have to use earbuds or my phone as a headphone.  3.  The screen is dim.  4.  If I use it to watch youtube videos I sometimes get lag.  5.  I am a visual learner.  6.  When I first received it I had no idea how to install the google apps.  7.  All the apps look really outdated.  8.  As it now stands, the screen is really a bit too dim. 9.  My battery life is horrible.  10.  It will be great if Google made the bootloader unlocked, but right now Google is just an OEM. 11. Â The stock browser doesn't look very nice.  12.  With the Nexus One being the first Android phone that has been released without an expandable memory slot (like the iPhone 4S and 4) it will be a long while until we have the best available memory solution. The Motorola Moto G (first and last) Posted by Matt at 8:20 AM I was disappointed to read that you're going to release a new phone, even with MotoMod, that is essentially a cheap phone with a decent but somewhat outdated display. You're missing out on a lot of the things that people like about Motorola devices like the Moto X, but you're basically just getting an inferior phone with some new bloatware. What's a company to do?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     (4 out of 4) I bought this to use for recording voiceover work for a new project for a client. The quality of the voiceovers is really good - the sounds are clean, detailed, and clear.  , which also includes all the features and controls of a professional sound card, with a 1.6Ghz processor and 128 MB of DDR2 memory. I also purchased the RCA cable to connect my laptop to it, which is included in the package.   The processor and memory were sufficient for my needs, but the soundcard has some issues that I need to fix before using it on my computer.  It is a great tool for recording, but there are some downsides that I should know about before continuing with the purchase.  The first is that it does not have an on-screen display that allows you to see which input you have selected on each input source.  This is a big problem for me because I like to be able to see what is going on during recording so that I can choose appropriate inputs.  Also, the screen does not update with the data and the data is not always accurate.  There are a few small quirks, but none of them are major enough to stop me from buying this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When you have a new phone, you are not going to love it.   I got the Samsung Galaxy Note II as I was looking for a better screen size, camera, and everything to be an iPhone user.  But I'm not the only one and many of my friends who got the same device are complaining about the device. The speakers are just awful.  They're louder than the speakers in my iPhone and the headphone jack is just not as good as the one in my  iPhone 5.  If you get the Note II and buy the S Pen you have to pay extra for the extra battery ( which also lasts much longer than a normal battery)   If they had a good battery, it would be $200 or $300.  The Samsung S Pen is great for drawing but has no ink and it's super loud.  It's really easy to use but is just a really bad addition to the device   Overall the Samsung phone is pretty much a downgrade. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device I received wasn't a bad purchase. It has a lot of good features for the money, but I wish the charging pad wasn't so bulky and the screen was at least slightly larger. The only downside I can see is the build quality.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     It's a shame that these poor designs and poor quality have made it to the hands of such a select group of collectors. The first thing that comes to mind is that these are plastic and not made of metal. However, the main problem I had was the plastic not being stiff enough. It bends pretty easily. I'm not even talking about when it flexes around my desk or when I have the thing stuck in a corner. I was just getting used to these things and I could feel it bending, just like a child with a Lego. That is not good. I had to get my hands very cold and bend it with my nails to hold it in a stable position. Other than that, the unit doesn't budge or bend once when dropped and the weight doesn't seem to matter either. If I had any complaints about the design, it is that there is no way for the battery to get out. If you drop it or drop it on your head, you can't get at the battery. I found this a bit odd, because I bought a battery cover with a tab on it. I think I was supposed to slide it in and push it out with the tab on the battery door. The battery door was a lot less convenient because of how small the gap was between the battery and the door. Another thing I don't like is that the battery itself doesn't actually connect to the top of the unit. It connects to the bottom by a spring that comes right out. This isn't so bad because the battery only comes out at the very back of the device. The last issue is that when I unplugged the unit, it disconnected the Bluetooth adapter from my iPhone. I have a couple of other Bluetooth adapters and none of them worked. I could just imagine people dropping this unit all over the place and it getting disconnected from the iPhone. The only saving grace is that Bluetooth works fine even when the unit isn't connected to the charger. This is a shame because the design could have been better if it was a bit more sturdy and less flimsy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't buy many of these cheap ones, I just get cheap ones on ebay and when they stop working or break the last one I bought broke within the first week. So this was a very cheap product. I got one at a yard sale and never used it because I bought a similar one at Home Depot a while back. It works, but it's not as good as the more expensive models.  Rated 4 out of 5 by davefromminnesota from Good unit. A little flimsy though. I bought this for a replacement to replace a broken one in my garage. The unit works perfectly. It looks good and is built strong. It also comes with everything you need to connect it up. This is one of the few models that has built in power cords so you don't have to bring any extra with you. However, I think the unit is a little flimsier then other models. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before it breaks down as I only get a few hours out of it each day. . ,  ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keypad is hard to use. It took me a good 10-15 minutes to get into a good rhythm. It's also annoying when the keypad turns off every time I press a button (the button you set the key to). Also, the screen seems to have a "dread" of turning off as well, which doesn't help.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, August 11, 2016  Good device but not a fan of the key-pads  by Christopher from Las Vegas NV USA  Pros: Easy to use  Cons: Keypad too small  Review: I was disappointed to find that this unit had no keypad at all - just a hard plastic keypad, so that's one thing you can't have for me. It also has no function for me: pressing a number on the keys always brings up a small LED "bug" that is only on if the key is pressed. Not great. .  in a word, it was ok. It was very easy to use (the "on-screen" keyboard and buttons were intuitive) and I liked the idea of having both function keys and function-keys. However, I am not very pleased with how the "on screen" keys seem to constantly be on and off. I think the keypads are too small for my small hand.  "The display is so small that the display can be difficult to read." I also found that when the computer does not have a keyboard plugged in, the mouse function keys do not work. The unit also did not come with an SD-Card reader which would have been nice. All in all, not the best product. :) Was this Review Useful to you?: Yes No Monday, August 02, 2016
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â You know what's going to happen next.   In order to create an accurate picture of the problems that your phone is having, let me show you a few examples of problems with my phone.  There are three problems:  1.  The display keeps flashing on and off without warning when you are in the app that you are trying to use.  It usually takes about 15 seconds for the screen to come back on and I have to restart my phone about 10 times before I get it to work again. 2.  While I can do almost everything on my phone, I don't think that this is possible without a very good computer.  I have found that if I try to do something on my desktop computer, my phone will crash immediately. 3.  When I get home from work, my battery is almost completely dead.  Even after turning on the flashlight and the car charger, the battery is still almost dead. All of the complaints mentioned above are problems that the phone has.  If you find that you can no longer use your phone, that is not the fault of your phone. You need to replace it.  That is what I am doing now. Â  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   For a long time, I've been asking "Is there a way to control the volume in my Bluetooth-equipped cell phone?"   Well, my quest has come to an end:    A simple firmware update has fixed the problem with my Bluetooth enabled phone    And, as expected, I'm no longer running out of volume on my Bluetooth phone.  Here's the link to the official support page:  I hope the official Bluetooth team is reading this... I'm also disappointed in my own Bluetooth device: The phone volume control is fine, but not nearly as nice as my smartphone, even with the volume knob turned down.   This is not just a "phone" problem, it's a phone and smartphone problem.  My other phone has similar problems, and there's no way to get them fixed.  If it wasn't for this firmware update, I'd still be having to call Bluetooth support to get this fixed. The good news is that they can only get it fixed for the original phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One thing I will say that this device is very heavy.   It is a full size device that you can easily use to monitor your home.  The battery is the largest battery I have seen on an   device.  There are several lights built in the device. When I plugged in the power cord it took several minutes for the light to come on.  However I found I was unable to power up the device on one of my devices until it turned on with the light on. It is the only light on this device. It   comes with a little sticker on the front that tells you what to do and what is on the battery.  Also this product comes with the charger but does not come with the battery because it is a little difficult to turn the device off with a full battery. I would like to have it come with a small case like the one that comes with my   Sony Playstation3. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a terrible device.   There's no support for bluetooth.  If you want to watch the movies on your phone, buy an ethernet dongle and watch it through an ether cable.  This phone is only good for sending emails, watching music from an app, and sending e-mails to people you know.  Also, no way to take photos, videos, or even pictures on the device. You have to download your pictures to your computer and view them through an e-mail client like Outlook or Thunderbird.  The screen resolution is low and the display is terrible.  My screen is 7" widescreen.  It takes 1 hour and 30 minutes to charge and it has to be plugged in through the wall.  After I purchased this device, I didn't think it was going to work out. I had been using a bluetooth keyboard and mouse to control my computer for almost 10 years.  I've learned that using your thumb to click a button on the keyboard, while holding your thumb flat against the screen is the easiest way to select stuff.  Because this device is bluetooth, I can't use my wireless mouse and keyboard at the same time because the Bluetooth connection wouldn't allow my computer to see the two mice and keyboard.  But I can control my laptop without having to use a wireless mouse or keyboard and it works flawlessly.  You have no choice but to use the computer. I've tried a USB keyboard and mice and this is the worst.  There is no way a bluestack USB keyboard will ever work in this device. I have two laptops with USB keyboards.  Unfortunately, it's too expensive to buy a bluestone USB keyboard because it's not a bluestechnology product.  All I can do is use this device with a blustacks, ethernet, and a mouse and use the mouse on the bluestacks to control the computer and I am constantly having to take the usb cable out of the bluestone and put it into the bluestechnical keyboard. So, don't buy this product. I'm disappointed to have spent so much money on a stupid thing that doesn't work.   Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Disappointing After using this for a week, it had to be replaced with the same model. The new model worked as advertised for the most part, but the wireless capability is just not worth the trouble to set up
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I received a very bad battery from this brand. They have a good product. This is the first one I have tried that did not work well, I returned it for a different brand one.  Great product! Love these things. Great price. They really save you money in the long run. Very easy to use. Will buy again!  Loves these. A must buy for the money. I use them for an old iPhone. They're also great for when I need to use a phone for a short period of time and don't have a charger around. They are very easy to get into, and the cable is longer than the charger itself which I love. Plus they have a USB cable to plug into an outlet. I've been really happy with them so far.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Don't buy this phone. I was very impressed with the design and build quality. I bought it because the price was good and I didn't want to pay too much for an iPhone 5.   This is not a bad phone and is definitely worth the money, but the design is sloppy and ugly. I also got a freebie with it.  You also have to carry the phone all the time because the display is not good and the size of the screen makes it awkward to use.  Overall this is a decent phone for $200 or less, but it's not a good choice for $600.  Â (Also check out the Samsung Galaxy S6 )
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â   Â I bought this item to replace the broken Apple EarPods that were included with my iPhone.   They work perfectly on my   iPhone 4   device, but after about a month of constant use, I decided to replace them with a set of the Beats Wireless.  This is the only reason I gave this product a 3 stars, the other 3 points are based on performance.  The first pair I bought were in good condition but had the same problem that was described in the other review, the wire gets caught on a screw.  In addition, I ordered a set that had a different color and the color I received was much darker than the one I ordered.  I contacted Beats directly and they sent me a new set immediately.  Once again, a quick response and replacement was sent.  Also, the sound quality is great.  If you need to have the convenience of a wired pair and are looking for a high quality pair, this is a great deal! Posted by Dan at 12:47 PM
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a   Apple   iPhone   a week ago. The phone is beautiful.   The battery is very good.  Â  But the   screen   is terrible.  It just   won't work on a Â bright   room.  The   only   positive   thing   about   the  iPhone is the Â audio.  You can tell it was   engineered   by   Steve Jobs   for  Â the   iPod.   It   sounds good and   loud.  I have a  iTunes   copy   of   some songs.  There are no   things   in   it that   bother me.  My   main complaint   to   people   who   say   that Â  it   looks like   an   iPad   because   there is no Â  back .  Well there   are.  One is a  cable that needs to be   attached   near   this   hole   on the  phone.  Another is that  it Â has Â  a  back  and  itÂ   seems   hard to Â  move it around.  Thirdly the  ear bud on the phone does not stay in  ear.  It does not close all the way.  When it is in  ears   and you put in your earphone it  sounds great but not all the time. Â I will be buying an  iMac   which   has   better   sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really had high hopes for this phone, and i was not disappointed.   My first impression is that it is a bit underpowered - the battery life was average for a dual sim phone with great screen. The phone did have a lot of power-hungry apps installed, but they were fairly lightweight apps.  The camera is quite good, I took some decent shots with it.  I wish it came with a micro SD card instead of an internal one like every other android phone.  But overall, i'm happy with this phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You're going to be disappointed with the build quality, sound quality, and lack of memory (especially the 3-hour battery life).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a bit on the expensive side. It comes with 3.5mm stereo headphones which I really liked but the sound quality was quite flat. I was hoping for a little more in the sound department, but other than that, good overall performance.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product is NOT worth the money.   It is not even compatible with my laptop's usb port.  I had to open it in order to use it, and it didn't work.  You get what you pay for, but don't expect much.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You bought an inexpensive electronic device that had some issues with stability and reliability. The device was never very stable on my desk or in my hands. I did not trust it enough to carry it for longer periods of time so I replaced it with the one that I bought in January of 2016 and that device is still very stable. I am not aware of how the issues with this other one were fixed but I hope this one is.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new Samsung Tab 3 10" tablet, with 10 hour battery life, and this device did not work properly.   After opening the back,  the device was covered in a fine, black dust.  I carefully opened the tablet and the dust was removed.  The tablet was a very good size and I was pleased with the performance.  After this,  my family and I purchased  another  Samsung Tab 10".   The battery life is only about an hour.  It seems the battery must  have developed a flaw or a malfunction.  For the price,  it was a good product, but  the quality of the device and the customer service is lacking.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these and I don't regret it for a minute. The only issue I had is that these tend to get caught up on the cables and the battery when you put them in your laptop or computer. That is the only thing that has ever happened to me. I don;t know what the problem is but I did get a replacement battery but it didn't work with my laptop so I got another one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price of this is right. It is the most durable, best keyboard I have used. There are no complaints about the keyboard. However, it is a little hard to type. I think if I bought a cheap mechanical keyboard the first thing I would try is an adapter to make the key travel easier to reach.   Overall, the best keyboard you can get for the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPad Air, with its huge screen, is a beautiful and very practical computer. It is also a good and useful tool for studying and working, but the price is out of line with the value of the product. The $1,299 starting price is not affordable for many, and the only reasons for buying it (at least for me) are the amazing size and performance, and its excellent value for money.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was looking for something to keep up with the high speed and battery life of my tablet PC. I was excited to get the HP Touchpad and saw reviews on it and felt it would be perfect for what I was hoping for and a lot better than the old wireless mouse that I was using. Unfortunately, the touchpad didn't seem very responsive and it was very hard to find the right button. I decided to spend $50 on a mouse from a local e-tailer to use with my tablet but it's still the worst mouse I've ever used.    Write a positive review about an outstanding electronic device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In my opinion it is a very good buy, even better for the price than the Samsungs. This device is well built with very good build quality. The speaker works fine on a quiet day, but I would use the volume control on this phone to hear all the noises around me and then turn up the volume. I really like the new design for the volume rocker (it was my favorite before). The camera on this is great. It shoots pretty good picture and I have a pretty good quality of the video. It is easy to take a few pictures of something and then take a picture of the thing later (it will come out blurry, but if you're into that kinda thing, it's pretty good). I would buy this again because I like the build quality and I think it is very well made. If I was selling it I would say it is pretty expensive, but considering the price difference for all the other Samsungs in this review, it isn't that bad. I can't say that it is worth it to me, but maybe if you are in a pinch, it will be good enough. Also, if you aren't that into photography, I would recommend this one.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is trash! I bought this to play my Playstation 2 games on my TV, but it's a terrible system. Not sure if I ever even turned the sound up. The sound is not consistent either, the bass is not there at all, and the subwoofer is actually just a small plastic box. It's not even plugged into anything! It also plays back crappy audio, and has the same problem with the sound. It was definitely a waste of money! Do not buy this, it is definitely a rip off!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As a result of its very poor audio performance, the CDI-A6 is a non-starter for me. As far as I can see, there's no difference between CDI and DAC1X in terms of audio fidelity - the CDJ2's sound is better than the CDIF-A2, if you can call it a DAC.   The lack of any real audio gain control (in other words, you cannot turn up the EQ while you're using the CD, so it sounds very tinny) was also a pain.  - May 18, 2013CDJ-X1/CDI-1X - The best in class  Reviewer: dtsears - favorite favorite favorite - March 12, 2013  Subject: CD jacks? - March 2, 2013The "CD jacks" on the J-10 are terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You have no idea how many times I've bought a product and never opened it. After all, it was the only thing that worked in my car for years. I'm sure you know what I mean. I bought the JBL system to replace my old crappy speakers in my Toyota RAV4. After opening the box, my first thought was "No way! It's not made by JBL." I thought, "This is going to be so loud." After playing a few tracks, my brain finally figured out that it's a JBL and not a real JBL. I took it out of the box and listened to a few songs on my iPod and it sounded amazing! JBL's sound signature is very warm with a great balance between bass and treble. I also liked the fact that I could turn it off (it was only on when it was turned on). It's great for a car audio system with lots of power but still have a good volume. You can use the JBLE system in a larger car to really have a large sound. For those looking for a little more oomph, I also like the DASH II. I found the sound of the Dashes to be more focused and full without being overly boomy. You know you want to play it, but you don't want to push it too hard. This is the kind of system that can be turned on and off as needed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device works ok, but for a $20 product you get nothing more than what you pay for. It should be called the MEGA MEGA or something like that, that way you get the most bang for your buck.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mikey from I'm in love with this phone! I am a musician and the sound of this phone is perfect! I have it on my iPad but it's too small to use on my iPhone. I have a couple of other phone models but this one is the one I carry with me the most, and it's the best.  on a side note this is the first device I've ever bought from Bose that actually works! I'm using it with a Tama acoustic bass guitar that I bought back in 2005. The phone is very easy to use and my friend got one as well, so it's all working great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If your iPod (or any portable music player) becomes a rattly mess after a few months, you might have a faulty part.   It's probably not the plastic casing that's broken.  This happens from time to time with all sorts of electronics, from old school Walkmans to newer models.  To check for a faulty plastic part in your iPod, follow these steps: Open the back of your iPod.  Remove the plastic covering on the back cover (this will make it easier to determine if it is faulty).  Remove all the components, including the battery. Remove the speaker and find a part that is connected to the circuit board.  Take a pin out and insert a small flathead screwdriver into the hole. Make sure it fits. If it doesn't, you can buy a replacement part. In many cases, the speaker is located under the battery on the circuit boards. In any case, you must remove the battery before you can test the circuit.  In addition to the two pins, replace the battery with a new one.  The new battery has been installed.  Now you can use an adapter to connect the old iPod to the new one, and vice versa.  A more advanced way to replace the speaker cable is to remove the top casing and solder a new connector to the back, then use a screwdriver to make a fresh connection. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â Great device. The unit does what it says it will do, and is easy to set up and use. The buttons do not have as much spring, but it is not enough to affect the speed at which you use the unit.   The LCD screen does not work very well (I have found that most of my problems with this unit, are not related to the unit itself) but after a couple hours, the unit works better than the first time.  I am sure the unit is not as fast as it was at the start but after about a month of using the unit, it's a great deal.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this item to replace a defective iPhone 4 that was in need of a repair.   The phone works fine (although the screen does flicker).   If the phone were a fraction of the price I paid for this item ( $100 ), it would be a 10 or so.  The screen is also slightly scratchy, but it is still usable.  Overall, I would not recommend this item for a new iPhone 4, but if you want a decent replacement phone at a reasonable price, go for it.   5 out of 5 Great purchase! Got my new iPhone 5S on day 1. The service is great. They even refunded my shipping!  4 out of the 5 My daughter had a faulty iPhone 5c. She really liked the iPhone 5s. The display is beautiful. She even made a video. But, one of the screen bezel broke on the back. I was very disappointed. I thought I'd return it. I am glad to say they replaced it for free. The problem is the bezel is now very warped. It seems that someone put a lot of pressure on the iPhone. That's why the back of the phone is so warped.  3 out of 4 Good product - poor customer service I was extremely disappointed with my new Apple iPhone. It came well packed and as advertised. I went to check out, and there was a small scratch on the screen - almost as if someone put something into it. After a few minutes of looking at it in the store, the customer service rep took it back. The repair would take another 2 weeks. She then explained that this is not normal, and that this will not be fixed by Apple. So, I'm back home. This is a total waste of money and my time. This will be my last Apple product for a long time! /end rant

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because my phone couldn't be used to call my wife and tell her I was ok and that the vet got me back. After a week of using this I am finding that it is too loud for my situation and I would rather have a headphone in my pocket. The phone battery is also getting low and they don't even have a charger that is a good size for the size. I can't find a good charger online or anywhere near my house. It is a bit over priced for how little use this phone has made out of the first week. If you have a hard time with noise then I would definitely not recommend this phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I ordered this laptop with the intention of using it for a few months until I found something more efficient.   Initially, I found it very slow and had a hard time with the menus and the screen was too small.  After some research I found the Toshiba T2413M (as it was called then) was a better choice in my opinion.  I would have bought this machine anyway because it's much more efficient than the Tos- one.  But this laptop has several problems:  1. I wish the keyboard had more travel and had more keys.  2. The screen has a high brightness, even when I am looking at a black screen.  3. It has a very poor trackpad with bad tracking and very poor accuracy.  4. When I open a folder from a link in my email, the folders will still be closed at the first click (although the link was clicked at the time the folder was opened).  5. It was so difficult to close some folders when they had icons on them when using Windows Explorer (they were already on the desktop).  6. It took me hours to figure out the shortcut keys in the Task manager, the last time I did this was to fix a problem.  7. The battery life is not enough.  8. The laptop doesn't work well when it is cold in my dorm room.  Product review: Toshiba Satellite P505LN-F1T6
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It wasn't a good experience I've purchased 3 or 4 times from Apple, but this time I was happy with the item.   I have an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPhone 6s Plus.  I wanted a case that was made of polycarbonate and didn't look cheap and the new case from Apple matched these characteristics.  After using it for a few days I found that I could hear everything I was hearing.  It is great for watching movies and games on my phone.  When I got this case I also got the iPhone 6S Plus case which is a better quality.  So I give this case a 5 star.  Overall I am very happy with this case and hope they make the 6s case. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got the device, the first thing that struck me was the size and weight of the device. I thought it was a big, bulky, bulky brick!  But after spending some time with the device and watching a few videos I realized that the brick was actually very nice. It is very durable, so it can survive a few days of use and not let a drop of water affect it. The quality of the build is also great. It does have a few minor blemishes, but nothing major and they seem to have been picked up and cleaned up after just a couple of days of regular use. It comes with the cable, the case, and a small booklet that contains some general info and a quick set up guide.   As a bonus, it also comes with a really nice power supply to keep it going, and even a charging stand if you ever wanted to charge the phone while riding your bike.  I really hope this review helps others to make an informed decision about what to get, and that it gets good reviews. If you are thinking of buying this, I'd really recommend that you get the charger and case since it is an expensive investment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was the worst electronics I've ever owned in my life. I got it for my new computer, which i have just started using. Before the warranty ran out, my new monitor died on me. I called customer service, who couldn't do anything about it (the replacement monitor that I had ordered wouldn't even work with my old one). So I asked them to do something, and they sent me back a new monitor with an 8 month warranty, but it didn't work either (I think my new screen is better than the one from before, but who knows?). So I just sent it back, and I'm waiting to see if they ever come out and fix it (because I paid for a new unit). So, as of right now, I'm SOL. This product has really sucked the life out of the computer, and it's been over a year now since I bought it. And when I say suck the life, I don't mean it in a "this thing is a piece of garbage" kind of way. I mean in the "I don't want to have to put up with this" way. Like a piece o crap.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The best and simplest keyboard on the market! It's extremely easy to type on, but very responsive. The only problem is that the keys are hard to press and the keys don't have a good surface feel. I'm a software engineer for web development so I have a few computers. I like the layout of the keys and it's simple, so I bought one with this keyboard, and it worked for the longest time. It does not feel as nice as my Logitech keyboard, so it's a very fine trade-off. The only thing I don't like is that I have to manually turn off power to the computer if I want to put it down. This is not an issue though because there is no battery to lose and the keyboard is very well built. This keyboard also works on an iPad. I just use my iPad to type text because it's much easier on the fingers and it does not have a power cord for power. It comes with a small case with a keyboard stand but a good laptop stand would be better.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great product. The price is unbeatable. I bought one of these a week ago for $24 on sale. For that I got 4 gigabytes. It was the only item that was compatible with the old computer i am working on. The screen size is great for gaming and for watching TV. The sound quality is also amazing. I have only been using it for a few days, but i'm enjoying it. I do not see how this can get any better. It is my first computer purchase and i am sure to be buying a lot more in the near future. I just wish this company would make the same price for every product that comes out. It would be nice if they started doing business in countries that are not as advanced as the US. But that is just me being a greedy American and not understanding how a Chinese company can sell quality products at low prices.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device as a gift to myself for my birthday, and while I do not use it very much (maybe a quarter or less at a time), it is very handy! However, when I was using it yesterday (a new set of keys that I have to re-key), I realized that it was a little loud. It can be quite annoying, especially when you are having a conversation with someone and you're using your headphones or speakers. The volume can be turned down pretty easily and the noise reduction is also nice. This is a little larger and thicker than a small speaker, and that can be a little hard to carry around, but it is still a good size. Overall, I do like it and would recommend it to someone, but just be aware that you may have to carry it around a bit for a while if you are not used to carrying around your speakers or headphones.   This is the only item I have ever returned because it was defective. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device was not working at first and a friend gave it to me.

I have used this product many times and have never had this problem. I would not recommend this product.    Rated 1 out of 5 by Chris from Terrible quality Very poor quality, this device is not worth a penny. I bought one as a present for a friend and it was junk. It's impossible to use and the whole thing falls apart very easy. I will have to send it back and buy the cheaper version from my local hardware store. This company is not a good one to buy from, even though they claim that their stuff is good quality. They really need to be held accountable by the public.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     It's really very similar to an old style "DAC" type of player, in that it provides a "digital" sound rather than a "analogue" sound with a "line out" output. For me, it's just too quiet, the tone is a bit muddy and it's hard to find the controls. In other words, it does sound good but I think the price of a decent unit would be a bit cheaper. If you have an old tube amp then the V-22 is an excellent player and a great piece of history. I'll wait until I can afford an old version of the unit.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Rated 5 out of 5 by jessicac from I bought these to use with my iphone 5 and they do an excellent job of holding up to everyday use. I can be very precise with my finger print so this helped make it easier to do. It's a bit bulky for a handkerchief but it's sturdy enough that I don't think I'll ever buy a hand kerchief that's bigger. I like that it comes in a variety of colors.  Customer Testimonials: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was a bad purchase.   The phone was not made by Samsung.  The buttons felt loose and weak.  No signal and the phone did not get any signal.  This phone was bad    It's not as good as other phones from Samsung:  I have been a user of Samsung Galaxy Note for a while now and I can easily say that this is my first Samsung smartphone. I had a lot of expectations about this phone and after all, Samsung is a huge company.  When I first got the phone, I was really excited about it. But after a week or so, the battery had completely died and it took about 5 days to charge up again. So for a few days I had no data on my Note. After that the phone became much worse. I am not sure if I am used to this phone or just used it for a long time but the phone just doesn't work like other Note I have used. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The Etymotic ER4 is a cool looking little device. It's very lightweight, has a sleek design and fits in well with the other Ety's I have.   I have 2 of them in various configurations, the first is the Etydox, which uses the standard 2 AA batteries and the second is the X-BOT which I have for my DJ Ipod.  I can't say this is a great battery life, but it's a good device and the quality of the buttons is good.  One issue is that the screen is a little sensitive to the touch, so if I hold the buttons for a second or two after taking them out of my pocket, the screen will light up red.  Another issue is I have to manually turn the volume on the screen (using the power button), this could be solved by using a different method of volume control like the other e-doxes I have, but I would like to have this be a universal design so more people can have access to the same controls.  Other than that, a very good little battery powered device.  Review of DJI Inspire 2   DJI's Inspire 1 was the first small drone that I used for commercial purposes and it was an awesome little drone that was a lot of fun to fly. It was also expensive.  The Inspire2 (the Inspire II now) is a much better value, and it is a lot better.  It is a larger drone, which is good if you are in a confined space, but the battery life is slightly worse than the Inspire1, and I had to carry an extra battery.  For the price, you can't get much better.Â   DJI Phantom 2 Standard Remote Control   This is the remote control that comes with the Phantom 2 and I use this with a Sony Bluetooth headset.  This seems to be the default remote control for the Phantom2 and the same one that comes on the other newer models.  Using the remote makes it very easy to fly, you just hit the green button on the bottom of the unit and you get to work.  If you are looking to get more information on the Phantom 1, the best way to check out its features is to go to the DJI website.  DJIs website is the best place to find any information about the Phantom drone itself, but also for the newer Inspire models,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      I was disappointed with this piece of junk. It worked on a couple of occasions, and the video quality was acceptable. But the problem with this product was it was so noisy that it was impossible to watch the video without feeling like you were being taunted by some high school kid.  Pros: - Very nice video quality - Can be used as a flashlight, or to monitor the location of the children - A lot of battery life for the size - Works as advertised - No issues with the video being taunting  Cons: - Larger than expected, especially on the USB charging port (only because the original USB port is a little too large)  Comments: I originally bought this piece to monitor my daughter while I was away on business. It's perfect for that. The device charges very quickly, and is super easy to use. If you need something that will charge while you're away on a business trip, this is the one. The only complaint I have about it is the charging port isn't as large as I would have liked, but other than that, it's a great product!  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device because I had used a previous one for a long time and was happy with it. Unfortunately, the unit failed after 6 months of use. I emailed Amazon a few questions about the problems and they replied by email: 1) they said they could not send a replacement for me, because the problem was with the original unit (the one I have had for almost 6 months). The original unit failed because it had a bad battery (I think?). They offered me a refund of the original purchase price. That was not acceptable to me. 2) the replacement unit does not seem to be worth the money or hassle, and I have to return it because I did not get it working right away (which I thought was my only problem with the unit). Amazon did not seem like a company that would be happy with the customer. 3) I have contacted the "contact us" section of the website and the reply was, "We do not have a return or replacement policy for the products that are in the Amazon.com return policies." I do not feel that I got a fair deal from Amazon. I felt like I was getting ripped off.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love my iphone 7s Plus but it's a great shame iphones with the same specs do not have a battery saver mode and this iphon has a problem that has become a regular feature and now a nuisance:  When you charge it up it goes into a deep sleep mode   but I have noticed this happening more and more frequently and this is really annoying:  If you leave the iphona in your pocket for a few minutes it becomes very hot.  When I was trying to charge it I noticed that the heat had completely destroyed the battery and I could hear the charging motor and the charging coil moving up and down in a rapid motion.   But I am going to try to turn it off   until Apple or Samsung get around to fixing it:

However, the larger diameter does not allow for as good of a grip, so the 1-1/4 is really better in my opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The e cig is great, but there's a ton of problems with it. 1) It's not rechargeable.   You have to buy an adapter to charge it with a normal wall charger.  2) The batteries are horrible. I've had them for 3 years and they have given me horrible burns and they don't last as long.  3) The taste is horrible.  4) The airflow is too little.  5) The charger is too big.  If I had to take a good 10 days off work and still have problems I'd call this a product of utter failure. I would not recommend this to my friends or relatives.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What a bummer   A new iMac (2015) is a nice improvement over my first two iMacs but that doesn't mean it's a perfect machine. I purchased a 2017 model because my original 2015 was dying. I have to say I'm really glad I did this, because my old 2015 was a big disappointment. I would have gone through a lot of effort to replace the previous iMac, but it was way too big for my living room. The new 2016 iMac was small and light enough to fit in my closet and it was so much easier to assemble and use compared to the old model. The battery life is also noticeably better. One thing I'm annoyed about is Apple still requires you to plug in a power cable and a USB cable before the unit even turns on. Why? When I was a kid, if you wanted to use an electronic device, you would plug in the power cord, wait 5 minutes, then plug in your USB cable, wait another 5 minutes for the USB to charge, then switch back to the power plug. That's how I had to learn everything. This method is also not the easiest to learn with an older iMac. One nice benefit of the 2017 model is that Apple is going to let you upgrade to the 2018 model. That will be a great upgrade if you have a good computer already. I hope they don't let you take the other model if you're like me and you don't want to upgrade.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item was a gift from a friend. It was the first time I had ever used a pen in public, and I didn't have a lot of experience. I was disappointed in the first use as the nibs just didn't feel very wet.   The second time I used it I was more disappointed as the paper felt nice to the touch but the quality of the ink was poor. I'll try to give the pen a second chance but I think I'll pass on this one. Posted by Ranaa at 12:54 PM

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I was using the original HTC One S I was a little disappointed by the way the screen on the phone was showing up. It turned black when I put the battery in or removed the battery, the screen would turn black when the phone would vibrate. This didn't happen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 either. The original One S was way better in this regard, but it's clear that HTC had a tough time getting the hardware right on the S4, and that's why it's way better than the S3. One feature I liked on the first S, and still like the S 4 is the HTC BoomSound system. I don't use my phone all that much anyway, so this isn't a big deal, but when it's working properly and the sound is good, it's really nice to have. Other than the screen, which is very good and does get warm to the touch if you're using it a lot, the S 3 and 4 are very similar. The S 4's battery life isn't as good, but I do think it's a very good device overall. I'm still waiting for a device with USB 3.0 that is as quick as the one I use with the HTC One M8.    HTC One M7 review:  HTC has had a couple of big missteps over the past couple of years, and the company has been known to get it wrong at times. The company's new smartphone the One M9 continues that trend. The device was announced with high hopes, and while I was able to get my hands on one to test it out, it wasn't for long. The hardware is very nice, the design is much improved from last year's One and the user interface is just as good as the One S. But if HTC really wants to get back in the game in 2013 it needs to do a better job of releasing new devices and not just keep putting out the same old One.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     - I received my iStick today, and I was impressed with the design. I have used many different electronic cigarettes, and have to say that this one is by far the best of the ones I've had. It's easy to operate, but also very easy to clean, refill, and change. The batteries last very well, and last a long time without dying. As a smoker, I like having a lot of options, and this is definitely one of them.  The only downfall of this unit is the price, the only e cigarette product I could afford and still afford to live without. It would have been nice if it was a little longer, but it works fine. . - The only downside of this device is the $1.39 shipping to me, plus I had to wait 1 week for the shipping to arrive.  and to add insult to injury...when I called to pick up my electronic cigarette, I was told there were too many other orders, so I was refunded $2.59, but had to pay another $5.99 shipping, and a $9.99 handling fee to have them return my item, and now I have to go to the post office and pay $14.99 to return it, and add another $9 fee...all because I called and asked for a refund instead of shipping and handling fees. So basically I'm paying $13.99 in total just for the return shipping fees. When I asked if I could cancel my order, they said "We have no choice but to take your money.". - The other issue I have with it is the battery life. It lasts quite a while, but I've been using it 3 hours a day for the past 2 months and that seems to be the limit for this unit, even when I'm only vaping for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I would definitely recommend this product, but would like to see the battery run out a little faster. Rohto  Great price, great product, great company  This was my first vape purchase. I don't normally buy electronic cigarettes so I really wasn't sure what to expect. I love that there are so many choices. My favorite brand to date is Tohm eGo because I enjoy the flavors the best. I'm really enjoying my purchase.  to add to my positive review: I have a question that I had a few times prior to purchasing this

So you have to have enough volume on the audio device or volume level can not be changed.  "

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The "Eco Friendly" (ie. Not-Made-in-China) version of this product was not made in China. It was made in a country that was not subject to U.S. or EU laws regarding product safety and quality. The packaging (ie: the plastic case) looked cheap (ie the parts could not possibly fit together), the buttons were too small for my finger to press comfortably, the buttons did not provide any tactile response, the speaker was not louder than any other speaker I have tried, the speakers did not come on in my car, and the button on the USB cable was "stuck" open. It also has a high-powered speaker, but not at any volume. I gave this product three stars because I like to keep a "smart" gadget around in my room, and I am happy to have a backup USB power supply in case the "smartness" of my iPhone gets compromised by an accident or a malfunction. However, I cannot recommend this product unless you are willing to do a few extra "hacks" to make it work.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I would not recommend the CECH-100   It is easy to lose the battery   Because I need a battery, and I use the laptop constantly    The CECH100 does what it's supposed to do - provide excellent power and connectivity with your laptop. However, the batteries (a set of 3) do not seem to last very long and the design of the battery tray, which is not very deep, creates a problem if you have a thin laptop or tablet on it. Otherwise, the power and connection quality is excellent and the port design is excellent.  I'm a power user that likes to keep the lights on and the speakers blaring. I had this for a year, until it died. , the Cech 100 does an admirable job, even though there are flaws.   The only real issues with the CEM 100 are the (very) short battery life and the fact that the battery compartment is slightly raised above the laptop surface. This allows the batteries to get caught on the laptop, causing them to get lost or get damaged if dropped. As a result, I do not recommend buying this product for power users. It is an amazing piece of equipment and worth the money, but not recommended to everyday users.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My son and I were on a road trip a few years ago when he told me that he was going to "put an end" to his "old" flip phone.   The previous owner had bought him this brand new flip phone and had it in the backseat of his truck on the side rack of his pickup truck.  He told me he never would have got it used.  The thing was so bad he had to take it to a service center to get it fixed.  As a man that likes my electronic devices to function he said "I'll never use this."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What makes this device great for us is that it can be used for almost anything you could think of. The screen is nice for a phone but not so good for gaming, especially when compared to the screen on an iphone.   But it is nice to have it on your pocket just in case something happens to your phone and you don't want to pull it out. The only negative that I have for this phone is that there is no camera so you will have to use your tablet or an iPhone to take pictures. If it could have one more function than the screen to be able to take a picture and save it to a memory card then I could live with it for a little bit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought an Apple iPhone 4s today in the store with great expectations. After reading many reviews on this forum, I'm now concerned that there may be a hardware defect with this phone. I've tried turning the phone off and on many times. Every time, it will pop open and shut in a few seconds. It's been over 6 hours now and I can't do anything with the phone. It does not turn on when plugged into my laptop, so I can only use it with the screen set to the lowest brightness setting (to make it easier to find it). The phone is also very hard to open and close the screen. I'll be looking into buying a new one as soon as I can get a new iPhone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Rated 5 out of 5   I purchased this item for a Christmas gift for my son, a child who is currently being treated for autism. He has not yet learned to talk and would be extremely annoyed if he ever did learn. He received this unit about a week ago and it is working perfectly. The unit works well with him and his siblings. I can tell he is very pleased with it and is really learning to use it. The only con I can see is that the display is tiny and I am afraid the kids will run out of batteries before they have gotten to all of the fun things on the display!  by Drea from The Battery Life is a Huge Deal! I am so happy with this product because we have a 10 year old and a 5 year old who are the "puppies". The first battery went bad and we were worried about the second one but the battery in this unit is amazing. They have a little one (my 8 month old) that wants to see and play and she loves it. I purchased another battery for our 3 year old because he was learning so fast. Now that he has this battery I can put him in the car with the lights off and he doesn't even notice the noise in the house because he hears everything. I am sure he will love it as well. We have a new baby due in the next few weeks and it will be great to have this unit to teach them as well as the new one.  Very easy to use I'm very impressed with the battery life this unit provides, and it took less than 30 minutes to use the unit while the boys were in the other room. A great buy!

It took him about five minutes to repair it and I had to pay for it, not to mention there was no warning about a hardware issue with the HP keyboard.   Â  I've had Dell and Apple equipment for over a decade and their repair technicians are much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just wanted to say that my order of the iPhone 4   was not what i expected. I was so excited to buy this phone   from Apple   when I saw the deal on ebay   but when it arrived and plugged in, I was disappointed. The battery life is not long enough.   It also doesn't have a good screen.  It's just ok and not as nice as the   Nexus   that I have. I'm so dissapointed   with the  iPhone 4.    Don't buy a new  iPhone!   A few of you have asked me about   this   and why I would buy a  iPhone 5. I have been buying   iPhones   since   the  nokia   88   (which was the first  iPhone ). The  iPhone   5 is   a really nice   phone.  When   my   old   Nokia   89   got old and couldn't keep up, I   bought   one   of the  Microsoft   Xbox.  It   works great.  With   new   technology, the  new iPhone . 5   seems   like a really good   iPhone.  If   you   don't want to buy an  iPhone, then you Â  could   buy a Galaxy   S7 or   HTC   One. But don't   get the  Xbox   or the  Nokia.  I know I will be buying  the Microsoft Â  Xbox  this summer  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For the price and overall performance I expected more. The screen is just an ordinary LCD screen. The buttons are the same. The sound is good, but the only thing that makes this different from any other is the fact that it is wireless (compared to the 3.7v batteries of an iStick).    I don't have any issues at all with this device.   The only negative I can think of, is the lack of a screen with "retina" resolution. I was looking for a "retinitis" for my iSticks, but this seems to be the best one out there.  So I am giving it a 4 out of 5.  Would you recommend this to a friend?:   Yes  Review of eVic-VTC Mini:   I've been using an eVIC-VTP Mini for about a month, and so far I am very satisfied.  This is definitely the most compact portable vaporizer around, it fits perfectly in my shirt pocket, the battery life is great, the airflow is excellent, the heat up time is very quick.  I do notice that it doesn't heat the vapor as quickly as a typical vaporizer, but I'm guessing that is because it's so small.  The heat up is also a bit slow, but only because I tend to hold it for about 5-10 seconds before inhaling.  Overall, I am extremely happy with the eVicc. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was using my iMac (2009) for about a month and a half and i finally got tired of the weird color noise and the inability to switch the screen on and off in the middle of the night. I thought about replacing the computer with a new one but i decided to use my old computer (i7 MacBook Pro (Retina) with a 1TB HDD and 2.3GHZ Processor) instead to see if i could upgrade the firmware (and memory) on my iBook (i3,1GB Memory, 128GB SSD) to get rid of the color noise as well as the inability of changing the screen brightness. To my great surprise, the changes were very easy. This is a very nice computer and it is a shame to not get rid off the color interference in this computer. I am very happy with this computer and the change was so easy.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the ee-3 for the sole purpose of gaming on my laptop.   It's an excellent device in that it has an awesome feature set for its price point (including a dedicated audio jack), great design and the only thing that I'd gripe about is that you have to purchase a 2.5" USB stick to use the mouse and keyboard.  I'm not much of a gamer so I don't mind the price of this.  But to use it as a dedicated gaming device is a big let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It worked fine for the first few months, until I started experiencing constant failure of the phone.   One time, the charger went out, so I had to return it.  But, I also had to buy a different phone because I was experiencing the same problems with that one.  This review is for a different brand.  I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S6 from Best Buy (they even have it in my local store) and for some reason it had this problem, too.  It literally died within 5-6 months of owning it.

My new iPhone SE has almost a day more battery life than the previous model, but i am still missing one of my favorite apps, the 3D builder. Also the new design is very confusing.   Would have preferred a little more screen space for the app drawer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a Samsung EVO 7.0 with the Samsung 32 GB e-MMC card, and this unit has proven to be the worst e-reader I've ever had.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "The battery life is mediocre, you should probably use it sparingly unless you are very light on your cell phone battery. It will drain the battery in under 6 hours." -Cecil The "slight" is from the fact that it is a "cell phone battery" and it takes a long time to get up to the same power level as a tablet battery or phone battery, or even a regular laptop battery. Even the battery life on a typical desktop computer is "slightly" longer than on this device.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was so excited to get this device for my son's birthday. I used the USB-to-Serial Adapter, and the first thing I did was plug in a cheap USB hard drive and it booted up and gave me a message about "this device is not capable of reading data." This was the second time that I've tried to use this device as an interface to the hard drive, and failed. So I decided to use my home router to connect to the USB port. When I tried to type in a "disk size" command, it told me that there is no hard drive present, even though my hard drive is present and active. My second attempt to boot up and get it to display anything was very unsuccessful. The "device does not support the command line" message on my home computer made the process pretty easy, and I was able to get it up and running. It is good that it shows there is something wrong, but at least it wasn't a total fail. But my son has a Samsung Galaxy S3, and so this would be a bad device to use with that device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I've used the phone app before and I'm not convinced it does what it claims to. My experience is that you can't have a conversation with someone. The voice recognition sometimes gets it wrong so I've stopped using it, even though I'm sure a voice recognition error is bound to happen.   I really don't know how to fix it:     1) Make the app stop saying the word "sorry" so people who use the app can type in their own responses to texts and voice commands.  2) Add some of the text messages that are being sent to people who are in the "sorry state" to show them they can't text their friends, family members or other people in that state.   to add to the annoyance of the app:  To add to your annoyance, the app says your phone has two free voice lines. That's not quite true, because if your device is connected to the phone service, your phone also uses your two free lines. Your device only has one free voice line. This is a bug that has been there since it's initial release. To resolve this problem, you will need to upgrade to iOS 8.0 or later.To remove the app from your device, go to Settings and turn off automatic calling. Then re-enable automatic calling by opening the Settings app and go to General. There you will be able to turn off "Automatic call forwarding" which you can enable if you want to still have the app on your device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you are looking for a cheap e-reader for your children to read e-books, this may be the best one that you can get. There are many e-book readers available for children, but this is one of the least expensive ones that is still very good. It works on all types of computer (Windows and Mac). There is a good feature list:  It has a bright screen, and there are no moving parts.   It is battery powered   This is a very good e-reading device and I recommend it to all. I am glad to have bought it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's so nice when I can listen to a new album at work on my laptop, but not be able to listen to it on the phone because I have to go and plug in my iPhone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed on getting the T-Shirt, was the design. It is in fact a white T-shirt with black stripes on the front. A T-shirt is what you usually find in the mall (at least here). But why the black stripes? Are you trying to advertise that you have money? Well the Tshirt is a white shirt, so there is no need to have black stripes. The design is very nice, but I still think that it is a little more complicated than the typical T-shirts. I guess I could've done with a white version, but black is what I am used to. The sleeves are really long (like 2 sizes bigger than your average sleeve), so you are likely to get a bad fit and be disappointed with the results of your workout. This shirt was great in the beginning, but after a while I could tell that the buttons were being worn out from all the buttons clicking. The fabric is a soft cotton, so it's definitely not the worst fabric that I've ever used in a T- shirt, but the fact that it's so soft and stretchy at the same time makes it the perfect shirt to be used in the gym.    The sleeves are long enough to have good support, but do have the tendency to slide down your arm during exercises (or when you try to put it on in the locker). You can't really see it when you look at it, but if you put it back on, you will notice that the sleeve is a bit wrinkled from the sweat from exercising.  The T- Shirt does come in a variety of colors, including: white, black, and blue. I personally choose the white one, as it is just the right amount of contrast to the color of my skin. The cotton is a good quality (soft and very breathable), but the fabric is not as stretchy as I would like.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As a very experienced digital photographer, I was extremely skeptical to begin with with the K1000. I thought it would be like the other cheap Nikon cameras. I have several of these cameras in my collection that cost more than my house! The first impression was, I thought that it was a cheap digital SLR. I was not completely wrong. The K1000's buttons and dials are a bit cheap and flimsy. I had a camera in my hand one day and there were some scratches on the film counter (I think they are there to make sure your film has been shot before they give you the results). The film counter dials had a small scratch on it. I also have a Canon 100D with an electronic viewfinder. The Canon has more buttons, dials, and dial adjustments to choose from than any of the K-1000's. In short, I just found the camera to be very cheap. It's like a cheap camera, that shoots the same amount of pictures as a $5,000 one, if not more. There is absolutely no digital image quality. The only benefit of the film is that it has a good depth of field, but I would not want to use it. This would be a very poor choice if you shoot with film because it has poor quality. If you use it to shoot still life and portrait photographs I can see where some people might like it, but other photographers might not. The film doesn't produce much in terms of exposure (the camera gives the same exposure with the same aperture for every photograph) and the pictures don't have good depth, but it would work for most people's need of the image quality, or if you don't need much depth. But for digital photography it is not a good choice. Also there is a noticeable vibration. It does vibrate. The shutter is very fast, especially if you use the remote. The image on the screen looks a little strange when I watch movies. I haven't seen many movies with a lot of movement, but some movies do look good with a big shake. The camera also doesn't focus well (when you want to move the camera). It doesn't lock focus very well. If the screen is in focus, it will move around a lot. The quality of the images are good, but not really good for a camera like this. In the first week that I owned it, I have put a few thousand shots on it and I haven' t
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the best i've used.   I can't imagine anything worse than a poor quality device.  I've never found a better solution.  If it did not have a great battery, it would be a perfect little device. You can do so much in this thing.  The buttons are not very responsive or easy to use.  There are times when it will not let you start a new song.  You have to press the power button a couple times or just hit a spacebar and it will start.  It's not a big deal but makes it less enjoyable.  And for the price you pay, it should have been a lot better. I'm a little disappointed.  Overall, i am a big fan of the K-3 but I just can't recommend this device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     It does the job.   The only problem is that the batteries need to be recharged after a while of regular use, so they need to go to a power outlet, or else the phone may die.  This device is great for the money.  The build is great, the screen is sharp, and it's only $30 dollars, so I recommend this product if you are looking to get a new device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is the best tablet I've owned in a long time. I don't get the tablet that comes with the tablet because it's not as fast as the original iPad. However, the new iPad is so slow that it's useless.   The original iPad was only 2g, but I can't get it to turn on at all.  In the past, my tablets have only been used by my mom and brother. They love them.  It does not get the 4G LTE network from the carrier I buy it from, but the speeds on the Wi-Fi are so good that I can use it to read. My mom can also use it.  If you have kids, this is a good buy.  I just love the design of the tablet. I've found myself using it to do school work as well as watching TV. I'm hoping the tablet gets a newer model when the newer iPads come out next year.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A "must have" for those who do photography!   I received my Nikon D810 as a Christmas gift. I've used my D810 for about a year and have been amazed by its versatility. I can shoot stills and movies with the D810 and have yet to find a tool I don't love. I am a professional photographer, and I needed something better than what I have. This was perfect!  The quality is excellent, and the grip is excellent.   This review may be written a few months ago, but my D800 is now a 5 year old and the photos it takes with it have become much more useful than before. The new sensor has greatly improved the image quality and has dramatically improved its ability to take very high quality photos.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a bad product for those who are seeking a good speaker. The sound quality is horrible. The only good thing about this product is the fact that the product does come with the power cable. The power cable is not detachable, which is really a shame since you could at least have a detachable power cord. Also, the only way I could get the sound from this speaker was by plugging the cable into a USB plug. Also not very easy to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first few times I used this I just used the volume buttons on the remote to start a song, and then ended the song on the volume control.

I can hear music better and the song I was listening to just disappeared. It's hard to say if the X-100 is a good or a bad device, but if you want to have your favorite songs from all the bands playing at the same time on a compact disc then the X100 is the way to go.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     It's a good device but... The first time I used it I put it to the side, on the bed, and just let it work. It does a really great job at controlling the noise in my office, and it works great in quiet, dead areas. But then a few days later, after a long day at work, I decided to move the bed into the middle of the room, and then I noticed that the noise I was getting out of it had completely changed. With the noise it was producing in the previous place, there was a ton of it, so I had to turn the volume all the way up, and the noise went away. But that was a few weeks ago. I'm still getting the noise, but not nearly as much of it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had my  iPad 4 for several months and it worked fine. However, after about 3 months, the iSight camera stopped working and the screen would become completely blank. I contacted Apple support and they suggested I return the iphone. I thought this was a no-brainer since the camera worked fine on the  iPhone 5. But my phone is iphones and when i returned it to Apple, they insisted that iSlook was not a repairable issue.   To make a long story short: The iphon 4 worked perfectly for 4 months before the camera stopped functioning. I returned the ipad and iS look and was forced to give it to my sister who I had borrowed from her. The ipsense and camera iphonet never worked. The camera went dead every time I started the phone. I eventually took it to an Apple Store and the support tech told me there is nothing they could do. He asked me to return the phone for a new one, since they did not repair it. I refused.  This was a complete scam.  I was so disappointed in iphonest that the ipsensing iphony iSook could not be repaired. I have lost a lot of time and frustration because of iphost.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I am not a huge fan of the MIX-80.   The sound quality is ok, it just has that "trouble with the volume". It would be nice if the volume knob was a little more "responsive", but the rest of the device is just OK for the price.  A bit noisy, but overall a good unit for the money.  My friend bought this from a dealer and got the MINT model.  The only problem he had with this unit is that it was a "touch-only" unit and not really a "controller".  The problem with these "touch only" devices is that the buttons are really small and hard to feel when pressing them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â When I received my Moto G5 Plus I didn't expect much. I like having a phone with removable battery for traveling, I wanted the Moto G6 Plus, but with some upgrades. What I got was a phone that is fast, has a good camera and decent battery life, but has a very limited software experience. It isn't perfect, and it isn't the worst phone I have used. I feel like I would rather have received a Motorola phone. So I'm giving this 5 stars instead of 4 because I feel this phone has a place in the hands of users that aren't going to spend $600+ on a phone. That said, I still expect a lot from Motorola phones, but I'm not satisfied with this purchase.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I love the look and style of the e-reader and the large, easy to read screen... until the battery dies. This was my third attempt with the ereader and i am still waiting for the battery to die and then a new battery to replace the dead one. I have read the manual to the ebook reader multiple times and tried other e-readers... this one just refuses to start and when i call customer service about this it seems like it doesn't care that my batteries are dead. I would like to see a replacement, at least a new one, but that doesn't seem to be possible as it has been more than a month with no service or replacement of the batteries.  Write a positive review about the eReader:  .  ( )  The Best Product  I bought my first e-Reader several years ago when I was in middle school and was blown away by the technology. I wanted to read more and more books. I started buying the eBooks, mostly mystery fiction, and was sold and then my mom got me a Kindle. I read on it so I could read while I was working and playing. I loved my Kindle and when my friend asked me why I loved it, I said it was because it was fast and was so easy to use. Now that I am a senior in college and have the Kindle 2, I bought an eReader as well and have loved reading on it, but the Kindle is great for reading on the go, but you don't have the ease and speed of reading. The E-Reader is better in so many ways. It's bigger than the Kindle and it has a larger screen, but it's a great read any time of day. It looks good and feels like a luxury piece in the hand. This is the first eReader I've ever bought and I'm very happy with it. You Can't Go Wrong With This Product  The Best Product I Have Ever Owned  The best product you will ever buy. You can't go wrong. The eReader is so much more than an e-book reader! It works exactly the same as the Kindle, and you don?t even need to buy an extra battery!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     My first purchase, in the mid 1990s, was an RCA digital stereo receiver from Columbia. The unit was junk. I had already owned the Pioneer R-8, which I loved. I purchased a pair of Bowers & Wilkins X2 headphones for $120.00 in the late 80's. I was a true believer that the Bowers and Wilkins were superior to any other headphones I had heard.   This was the first digital stereo that I owned and still is.  The unit has excellent sound with crisp treble, good bass and good clarity. I wish that Columbia had made it out of aluminum.  My stereo has been on constant duty for 25+ years. I have had it for over 7 years and only recently received a new power supply.  I highly recommend this unit.

They worked fine until they were plugged into an old laptop that had a bad hard drive. I thought I had bought something that I needed to replace, but the whole device was defective. When I plugged it in, I was amazed at the lack of noise. I did a bit of research to see if I could find anything similar, and found that other people had bought similar units and were unhappy with them.

The other problem is that the wireless connection does not work with the iPhone.  If you want an iPhone, get a Samsung or LG watch.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My son bought this for his father for his 60th birthday.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As a customer, I've had many different devices, so I can honestly say that nothing makes me as upset as a device that doesn't perform or that I don't want to be using. I have one that has a broken battery that I can't even use. I hate that I have to replace it. And if it's a new iPhone, then I have problems with it immediately because it's too bad they don't have the "quick charge" that I use with my old iPhones.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I own 2 ipads and a iphone.   The ipad is a beautiful piece of technology, but the quality control issues are too serious to ever use a ime.  Both iphones do have great built-in speakers, but they are in different locations (the iphon has an in-ear headphone socket) and are very loud.  I don't need to hear it through my earbuds while driving, but there is still a loud noise coming from it. The iphoto has great bass, but not enough to justify using it.  When they first came out, I bought two, but I just now started using one and have not heard any problems with it. I have two complaints about the ime, though: The speaker jack doesn't work on my ime so I can't use the iphota, and the earbud plugs don't work with the ipod. The ipod plug is a little on the smaller side.  My other complaints are:  The screen is slightly difficult to reach, and I don t like the way the microphone works.  They are a little difficult to turn on and off, and they need a better memory feature.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had my first experience with a bluetooth mouse, and the first time I pressed the right mouse button I noticed the key didn't work, I used it again and the right button worked again.  ----------------------------------------------------------  1746 Great product, good price  Posted by - 20th October 2012   I liked the product. Works great and easy to connect to my 3d printer and it works perfectly. I'd recomend to buy the wireless model from here as well as a blu-ray drive  ---  Read all the reviews before buying - it's cheaper if you can read. .  (Posted by Nacho - 20/10/2012)  It's cheaper...  Purchased it, after reading all the positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it. It works fine. I've got it plugged into my 3D printer, so far the printer has just had to print in 2 colors, but once the blue and white are done it should print the other colors. I'll keep you updated on that. However, I'm wondering about the blu ray drive, would it be compatible to mine? Or is it just the one that comes with it? But the wireless connection works fine to my printer. But I don't know if it's going to work for mine. I just don't want to spend another 10 dollars, and wait another 3 months. Oh well, I'll still use it. I have an H3200U which works fine for my 3DPrint.  the only down fall is that it doesn't connect to a monitor, or my macbook pro at the moment.  and the mouse and keyboard aren't as smooth as my older ones.  have to work on that... (Posted on 18th September 2012) -1  What happened here? I had ordered the blu-RAY drive with the bluetooth adapter at the same time and they were both delivered to my house but the one without bluetooth had the error. I ordered the wireless mouse to replace it, I guess that is why it works ok but the blu drive did not arrive. (Posted in EU on 26th September, 2012)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are other brands I like better that cost much more.   For the $80 I paid for it, it's not very good.  I love my iPad and its quality is much better than this one.   Review by: kyle p. on April 13, 2014 :  I love my iTouch. I have it with an iphone 5s and a Samsung s8. My iPad is the size of a lunch box, and the iTouch fits in it. Its a great device for travel. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good touch tablet without the huge cost.  (reviewed 3 days after purchase)  Comment on this review:  A friend of mine gave this to me for Christmas. So far I've gotten 2 uses out of it so far. Its been sitting on my desk since I got it a few days ago. I bought the black version for work as a replacement for my old old one which had cracked on the bottom. I love the screen size. Its the perfect size for a laptop but not too small. I can just barely read the text on it but it is still readable. I will also be buying another one as a gift for him. I also got an iPad mini 4 to use for my kids. I am hoping it works out for them and I also wanted to use one for work while my computer is sitting around. It's so convenient to just grab an ipad and get to work on the go. It only costs about $50.00 for an ipod that you can just plug in and go. So if you can't afford a new iPad or an ipode, this is the best alternative.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently bought a "super" wireless printer, and as such I was excited about it and hoped for the best. My printer arrived, but the "super", "best" part of the printer didn't work at all and had to be sent back. The only negative I have about this product is that the paper it comes on is really cheap. It has a "stale" smell and the paper itself is really crumbly and soft. Not really a big deal since you can just print again when you have a better quality paper but you might have to.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device works and does work. It's nice to have a battery that's going to last. The only reason I'm giving this product a 1 star is because of the way it comes out of the box. It has a very tight squeeze that makes it hard to put it back together. I tried using a screwdriver to open it up, but it would only budge an inch. So the only way to get the unit back together is with the included set of flat head screws. I'm sure this will break down quickly. The one good thing about this product is that you don't have to put your battery back in. I think the problem is with how the battery comes out. If you get the flat head screwdriver, it's not that difficult to put the battery back together, but if you don the set of screws it takes a lot of effort. I can't recommend this product unless you have a flat head set screwdriver (or a friend to help)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed about the iSine is that it does not have a headphone output, although it does have a digital input. This is odd. For the money you would expect the iSi to have a USB input, at least if the sound is going to be digital. You will get much better sound if you have a microphone connected to the iNi. I use the sound on the iphone on my iPhone5 and it sounds better on there. The iS is a pretty simple device to use, you just turn it on and the iSound app takes care of the rest.   This is a good cheap digital interface for the price.  I like this iphon as much as my $300/pr earphones.

The one thing that would have made it better is the fact that it came with a charging cable so you could charge it outside.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was extremely disappointed with my eeek-a-mo, and its design and build quality. First of all, the ee-ek-am-o looks soooo cute and very attractive, but the build is extremely flimsy and not worthy of being an expensive electronic device. The little batteries do not last very long because the power cord is so short. The power supply connector is not very strong and the plug of the eee-ekam-m is so loose you have to push it into it (as a result, the connection is not stable). The eeeeekam m has very high power, which means that it is very annoying when you want to play the audio device and you turn it on and the sound quality is low, like in a car with no AC. And the only reason I gave a "4" is because the audio quality is acceptable for the price and this device looks so pretty, I just like that it has a great looking device and this one.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the problems I have with this radio is that I can't always read it in bright light with the remote. I can only read the numbers if it is dark. The button to adjust the brightness is a small button.    One of the advantages of the VHF is that you can tune in stations on 70 meters for free!   The good news is that the frequency range is still sufficient, at least if you are not listening for the band you are in. Â I have been able to use the same antenna to broadcast on the 70/30 band on 5 meters, the same repeater on 12 meters and a repeater at the same time on 70.     At this price, I expected to have a little more range.  The antenna is not directional and it will need to be mounted on a mast to receive on 70 and 30.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     -The screen is very small.  The touchpad does not work.  "It works for a month and it still needs a lot of work." I was really excited to try this gadget. It is a real step forward. After using it for a week, I found that its shortcomings are obvious. The first thing that caught my eye was the screen, which is really small and hard to use. The back of the keyboard has been badly cut and the touchpad is so sensitive that it has been nearly impossible to press keys or click the mouse. I bought this to replace a very similar Dell laptop, which worked flawlessly for a couple of weeks and was then replaced by Dell when the first one's battery got old. I was very interested in the fact that Dell was using Windows, but I can't say that this is a good choice. The keyboard is also hard to type on and even when I am pressing the keys, I have trouble moving them. There is only one USB port, so I have had to use my phone or some kind of other adapter for connecting an external hard drive. Finally, the backlight is not a good color, is very dim, and is not easily readable. My only other complaint is the price: It is $249.99 (USD) and it costs more than a MacBook Air, an HP Pavilion 15-w500 or the Toshiba Satellite 15, two laptops which have better displays and are much more portable.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - This is probably one of the worst electronic devices I've ever used. The sound quality is terrible, and the interface is just plain awful. The built in USB hub does not work, and there is no way to charge this thing, or to use a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. The case is so flimsy, it's unusable. - In the long term, I wouldn't recommend this device. It's ugly, it sucks, and it's overpriced. If you're a Mac owner, you'll find a better product, but if you're not, this thing is just so poorly built, and doesn't seem to work well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My son was very excited to receive his new Nintendo 3DS because he's been wanting one. I was so disappointed when he tried to play Mario Kart 7 last night. He tried to put the game into the 3DS and it wouldn't work. He said the 3D was terrible. It didn't even appear to be able to see a "wasted" life and when he did a level it seemed too easy. I am not sure if he just has a bad 3DS or something else has been wrong with the console so I'm looking at a couple of possible issues. 1. I thought it was the software but I am afraid I am just going to have to return it. I don't know if I could ever trust Nintendo again. 2. I can't even see any of the buttons on the unit. 3. He did all his homework and now he doesn't even know if he can use the game. I won't be putting my money into Nintendo ever again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First, I have to say, that I was disappointed by the very poor quality of the electronic devices that come with this set. I purchased this for my son's 5th birthday. We were pleased with the great price but the quality of these devices is not up to par with the price. For example, there are two lights on the outside of the lamp that have a bad reflector and the plastic covers are very cheap looking. The lights on both sides of the wall switch are poor quality as well, although the quality is not bad considering that they come with a wall switch. There are a couple other things that are not up-to-par with the quality or price of the products. I really wish that it were possible to change the bulbs. They have to be re-lumenited in the back of the unit. This might take an hour or so. They also have a bulb holder that is not working very well and we had to take them out and get new bulbs because one didn't work. I can't speak for the other people who have purchased this set, but they have a very limited selection of products, so the quality and selection may be better for you.

The Plus is also very heavy for a camera.   As always, make sure to buy from a reliable source.  Pico 7 is another great piece of gear that has fallen out of favor with a lot of photographers. It's a good portable alternative to the Olympus OM-D E-M5 if you're looking for a very small, lightweight, and lightweight digital camera. Pico can be used with a lens that is either fixed focal length or super wide angle. The Pico is also great for portraiture and street photography, although it's not a "great" choice for landscapes.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's a fine device, but there is a problem with the battery life.  It will last longer than a real battery should but not quite as long as a real one.   I bought the battery upgrade to see how the device would hold up to a day of heavy use, and I am disappointed that it lasted maybe 15-20 minutes between charges.  I used the device mainly on the desktop and it did a good job of keeping my computer running for the duration of my work day.  You need to consider that the device is a little bigger than a smartphone and the screen may not be as bright but the device does a good enough job of being a good phone replacement.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (3 /5) I bought this to use with the 3D printer I built a couple months ago. The device is very simple and straightforward and has the potential to be a decent and convenient way to print things using a hot-air gun. It prints out the object very smoothly and is reasonably accurate. However, the nozzle has a tendency to blow away the plastic at the tip. I have tried numerous times to re-dip the tip in melted plastic in an attempt to glue it on, but to no avail. As others have noted, there is a tendency for the plastic to detach and fall out at the base. I wish the plastic was more sturdy and easier to grip so the nozzle wouldn't be so easily dislodged. I am not an expert in 3D printing, so I have no idea how much of the problem was my own design and how much was my machine.  I recommend this product:  I recommend this item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the second iMac that i bought in two years, the first was a 5 year old iMac and it was an absolute chore to get it up to par. Now, i have two iMacs that were both very good.   Now the only problem is that i have to buy new keyboards on both iMac's.   What's the best thing about the old i5?   In a word: it is faster.  The old i3 is only fast because of the Intel HD 5000 graphics and all the fancy features that came with it. With a new i5 you get a much better i3 CPU and you get all the new features on that processor.  In addition, you get Intel HD graphics and the newest Apple OS X.  i3 will run everything but you are left with a slower overall speed.  Best iMac you can buy   i love this product.  I bought two. The first is the 13 inch one.  It has great picture, a really nice trackpad for navigation and is much faster than the old one. The new one is good, but it has a lot of problems. It gets a little slow in the 3d benchmarks, it will only run about 10 or so apps and it has very poor battery life. It's great when you need to work on something but when it comes to entertainment the old version is way better.  If you want to get a great computer for the price, get a new one. It is a great price and if you get the new model you get 10gb more RAM. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I love my samsung. It's very good, a little difficult to use but that's because it's only got 2 buttons, only 1 for home. But i hate it, there are NO extra features, it is the same as all the samsungs, very cheap and slow.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a nice little gadget, but it has a small issue:  This device only holds 2 batteries (2AAA batteries), and the battery pack is small and light. This is not a bad thing, but you'll have to carry around a spare battery pack in case one goes bad. That is not much of a hassle, but if you carry extra batteries for other gadgets, this will add up quickly. The other issue is that if you're going to use this with a camera, a tripod, or with a wireless remote, you'll need a spare power supply. Otherwise, the battery life seems OK, but then again, that depends on what you're using it for.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great device, a little difficult to use First off, as I mentioned above, I bought this to use with my Canon 7D (and the included battery pack) and an additional battery pack for the GH4. The remote (which is great for taking video or stills) is a huge help, but the only problem I've run into is that the remote's battery is not included (in fact, it's a separate item). It also seems the batteries in both the Canon and GH4 are soldered to the motherboard and can't be removed. The Canon 7Ds batteries (and others I've tested) are not this way; it's not like the GH2 or GH3 where you can just pull out the battery (or any other internal part). This is probably the first time the remote has come out of the box without a battery and I can't believe that they couldn't just have included a battery when it was developed. The reason this remote is bad for me is that it can't take remote-sensored video (yet), so you don't get all the awesome features of the GH camera's GH4 built in. I will say that this is one of the few devices that I've owned that I can use with the GH 4's onboard GH4 remote, but I don't think that's enough to make up for this lack of remote-sense. If I'm going to do this anyway, I will probably get a battery pack as a backup, because the GH3's battery packs are really expensive.   Rated 5 out of Five by AnonymousfromOH from Great gadget for the price I was very excited about this thing since it is an inexpensive, easy to use and small portable camera that takes great
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst bluetooth speaker I have ever bought. I bought two for my iPhone. The first one is the old model and is still in perfect condition with no scratches or blemishes. The second one is brand new and has only just been used by the seller so I can't comment on its condition. The sound is sub par and if you are looking to pair this with your phone they sound terrible. The buttons are too small so if you can't see the volume button you have to press the power button to turn it on so you can hear the music. I'm sure the speakers were designed this way because they were designed to plug into an AC adapter but it is impossible to plug it into a computer. Its a joke that the seller is selling it on ebay and i will be looking to return it as soon as i get my money back.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the first time I have bought something from the computer store that was so badly designed. I was very disappointed. The unit works fine until I try to turn it on. It says that this unit is "built to last", but the keyboard was damaged. It was the keys that were damaged. I called the company's customer service and they offered to send me a replacement keyboard. The replacement keyboard is not working. I have contacted them, but they still refuse to give me a refund. I wish I could give this business a zero because of this poor customer service.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod nano is a great idea but the final product is not worth the high price paid by your local store. The touch screen is not responsive.

The quality is good for the price but I would rather have the bigger iPod touch. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am a beginner to computers and my previous computer was a PC tower. The keyboard is nice but the track pad is awful. It can be difficult to use. I bought a new keyboard and it's great. I think I'll get a different mouse next.    Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very good but the keyboard could be better I purchased a K40 RGB keyboard that has a good travel weight but is not as responsive as I expected it would be. I'm using a Razer Naga from 2013, which is a keyboard that was built better than the one that I got. I don't know why Razer would not release a keyboard for their newer models. Maybe it's an older design that needs upgrading and you just can't upgrade it on new units.  Read all the reviews before you purchase.  with great reviews this is a good keyboard. I purchased one of these on a huuuuuge whim in anticipation of my new laptop's lack of a trackpad so that i would be able to type with my right thumb. after having to use the trackpad with a laptop, i knew the joys of the keyboard. if you don't have a large monitor you might have to buy a second keyboard but otherwise its good! I purchased the red version.  to make it even better is to buy the mouse. a trackball is nice. but that mouse just sucks.  (  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's really frustrating to use a small computer that can't hold a charge for more than a couple days. I purchased this to replace a 10 year old IBM laptop that is now broken. The battery does last for at least 5 hours on a full charge. It does not last the entire night.  5 out of 5 Great Value Good Product. Great Price  3 out of 3 found this review helpful Good quality computer  2 out of 2 found this. Excellent price  4 out of 4 found this helpful If you have a computer with a low amount of ram, this will be more than sufficient. I'm using the computer to run Linux and a few programs so I've been running the system mostly with the Intel integrated graphics card. However, the integrated graphics is quite low end for an integrated graphics device. The Intel integrated GPU is more than adequate. It's not too slow to run programs but the speed is a bit sluggish when using 3D programs. The fan on the back is loud and the power brick isn't very long, so I wouldn't recommend this as a long term solution for your home use. I've owned other computers with the same system and the performance was always adequate.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     4 out of 5   Good for the money This is the first time I've bought an e-cigarette. I was pretty disappointed with my first one, but I was lucky because I was able to return it for a full refund. It was a good price, and the taste is good. I'm going to have to purchase an e cig starter kit for my next purchase.  2 out of 1   Very disappointing This device has not performed well at all for me. Not very much flavor. I found the e-juice to be very sweet. The coil was also very inconsistent.  to get more flavor I got about 1/4 of the tank in and that was it. I've gotten wayyyyy too much juice for the tank and just burned it and it left a burnt taste on my taste buds. The juice is very sweet to me and not as smooth as I wanted. If you are like me and get too much vape then just switch to a starter kit or better yet a tank with higher wattage you will be more pleased with your purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I don't even want to know how a negative product review was handled   The review does not say it was a terrible product, it says that it did not work as expected. I'm not sure what "as expected" means when a product was defective.  Reviews on Amazon for defective products often have a disclaimer, saying it is a "buyer beware" article. Why do you think the review that was deleted was not a "get out of jail free" deal?  It's really strange to see a product review deleted but not the review of the product. This seems to be a case of the reviewer and the manufacturer both working for the company that owns the product, as opposed to a reviewer working for a company that has a problem with the product(s).  For some odd reason, you could make the argument that the reviews deleted are better reviews than the product review. I would suggest a separate category for reviews that should have been deleted.  I'm sorry for the extra "greediness" I have for deleting reviews.   My guess is that a lot of people don't realize this is happening, and will either leave reviews or never leave them. The deletion has been happening a lot recently. You can see some of the deleted reviews here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=140116

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For what it's worth, I've been using this for months now and I can say it has done what it said. For the price and size, it's a great device. If you've never used an Apple product and want to know how it's supposed to work, read the manual first. For me, it worked just fine until I tried to change the battery. The first time I tried it, it started going wrong, but after a week or so, the new battery went in, so the old one was actually the problem. The thing kept going "dead" every now and then, and I don't know if it would have worked without the new one, but it worked better with it. The fact that it has a battery indicator is a plus for me. But in a couple of days I started getting the phone unresponsive when it was supposed to be working. Every other time it's "working well." One other thing. I'm a huge fan of the Apple logo on the bottom of the phone. Every time I have to buy a new phone, I have this one in the case. I've also ordered this with a case. If I'm not going to take care of the device, I don a case to protect the screen. I hope it lasts long enough for me to buy two. Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     "I bought a brand new Toshiba laptop that was only a year old. The first day I used it, I could tell it would not work well in my home. The screen is tiny, and it has a horrible trackpad. I couldn't even find it on the Internet. I thought to myself I had to send it back, but then I saw that they were offering an exchange. I called a tech support and told them I was going to return the laptop. The support person gave me some advice about what I can expect with a new one, and I went online to see if there were any other issues, and found that my laptop had been recalled due to a fire risk. Now I don't know if I would have returned the laptop if I knew about this issue, but at least I can return the one that has been recalled without knowing I'm getting a brand-new one. I'm still not happy with the screen, but maybe I'll get over that with time. It would be nice if my laptop came with the latest drivers, but that is easy to get. Overall, a terrible experience. I didn't buy the laptop because I was looking for a high-end laptop, but because I wanted a solid, reliable laptop that works well. If I have to buy a laptop again, I'm probably not going to get the Toshiba."

The sound is bad, the buttons are too small for my liking.

The problem of having to put an adapter on the bottom is the best part.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a cheap, non-sensical computer that comes with Windows 7 installed and a very slow laptop. It is not a computer but a big box with a very poor keyboard.   The keyboard and touchpad are almost identical to those on the Dell laptop but the Dell is much more reliable, comes with an all-in-one operating system and a decent mouse.  It's so cheap, I could buy it by the dozens.  I was so looking forward to buying it, but after reading some of the reviews that say its useless, I decided to pass it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone's screen can be pretty bad. The screen does not use the full screen as shown by a picture. Instead the top half of the screen goes up to the side where the keys are (as opposed to the bottom half of a normal phone which has the screen above the keys), so when the phone is folded, the screen gets crushed. Also, the buttons can be a little hard to push. And I'm not a big fan of the design. However, if you are the type of person who likes to customize the looks of their devices, then the Moto G is for you. I wish this phone were a little cheaper and a little better. I think its about $100 less than a Galaxy S3, so that makes it about $200. But even so, if I were to buy this phone, I would be waiting for a better one and/or a cheaper one (or buying a cheaper phone). The price tag is a lot for what the phone provides, so be sure to consider that if you want this phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this device for about 6 months, and I would say that it is a great addition to your computer. However, I would give it 3.5 stars.   The power button is not located on the left side of the unit, so it's hard to find if you don't look for it. The volume and play buttons are on the back of the computer. It would be nice to see a small square button at the base of the keyboard, that would make it easy to find. There is no USB port either, so you have to use the keyboard's USB cable.  It would also be nice if there was a built in monitor out on the top of the desktop.  This keyboard also has a problem with having a backlight that goes out when you're not using it. I had to turn it off when I was in bed and didn't want the light to get bright. I tried to turn the computer on and off with my head on a pillow to see if it would turn it on again, but it didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only con I can think of is the small size.   Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 23, 2008  Great little flashlight!!  by Joe from El Paso TX USA  Review: This is a great little flashlight. I just got this one. I put it in my pocket and my two kids and one of my grandsons all have this one to help them.  The light is great. Very small. But I like the battery life. It is about 3.5 hours on high, and then 2.5 on medium. That is all that the power on high will provide, so you will have to turn it down before going to bed. The batteries are easy to charge (from a car battery charger) and it takes one full charge to get 4 hours of light. So you get the battery power you want. And the little battery holder is a nice touch. It doesn't go in your pocket while you are playing with your friends. And it has a low-profile pocket clip. It does not interfere with your pants pockets while walking around. I give it a great 5 stars. It was only $10, so it was a steal. And I would buy again.  the only negative is I wish the battery lasted for more than 2 hours. . ,   Was this Review Useful to you in deciding to buy this product?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the good design:  The design of the battery is very good:  It is a nice easy to slide into a pocket.   If you don't have one already:  Purchase a cheap one.  The battery will last much longer and it is so much easier to charge with a coin-type battery.  If this is what you get I suggest to you to spend a little more money and get something more durable like the one from a company that will support you through the bad times:  If it fails once or twice in a month:  Then you probably got a bad one. But if it fails for a month or more:  I wouldn't hesitate to buy it:  This will last you a very long time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have an old HP Compaq laptop that just got a new power supply, and now the laptop is crashing and burning. I tried different power supplies, none worked, it's so hot that when I unplug the power adapter and plug the power cord back in, the laptop goes up in flames. The laptop has an old AC adapter that is bad and just about gone. So I bought this power adapter for $20 (the box was free). It doesn't come with any documentation.   This thing is just horrible, I would avoid buying one at all cost.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      I purchased a wireless printer to replace my old 8-line black-on-white Canon printer which I no longer use. I've had it for two weeks and love the print quality of the Canon, but it does not support Epson Inkjet cartridges. I found out that a $5 adapter from Epson can be used with it and now the printer works with inkjet cartridges! The printer is a little slow and has trouble with large or delicate documents. It also doesn't handle print heads of different sizes. The Epson is the best way to go if you are a serious printer user. I'd suggest Epson over Canon.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my third GPD Pocket. I used to like the original GPD G3. The GPD pocket is very similar. There's a small USB port on the bottom, which means you can charge your GPD device over a standard USB cable. I got the new GPD H4 which is a pretty nice device. My only problem is that the USB cable is only about 1 meter long and the charging port is small enough to fit inside the pocket. You can actually get it to stick out of the pocket but I found that the battery was a little tight when the USB was plugged in. The cable is definitely not thick enough for the larger GPD models. I think it's about average for a pocketable USB charger. I am looking into the GPD P3 and would like to see the pocket size and overall look of this one. You could probably make one that is larger and a little thicker, but I'm not a fan of the compact design.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: gpd
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a problem with a Samsung Galaxy S3, in the process of recovering the data, the device got a power cut and the phone froze. I couldn't reboot it, because the screen would turn off and the battery would not charge. I called Samsung, and they said they would send out a new device for free. I thought that was the end of the matter, but when I received the new phone (with the same model number and battery) the device went dead again. My original Samsung had stopped working because of the power problems. I contacted Samsung, but they said it's a hardware issue. They said that I should not be calling, they would replace the phone and let me know if it worked. They sent me a new one. It's not the same device but it works fine. I just called to complain. They told me they have been unable to diagnose the problem. So I am going to ask for my money back and I am filing a claim with my insurance company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the best things I've found about this product is how well it's built.   The cable is metal and well-made.  When I plug it in the other end is a plastic connector that I don't like at all.  A single screw can't hold the two ends together!  When plugged into an Apple device (I used an iPad mini) it acts as a "normal" adapter, but when it's connected to an iPod or MP3 player it acts more like a "special" adapter.  I bought mine a month ago.  One month later, I plugged it in and it failed!   After it failed, I returned it to the Apple Store and bought the new version which has the right connector and is easier to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These were the first wireless routers I have ever owned and unfortunately, they are the worst wireless routers. I used them with a Nexus 7, but have only had them for a few days and I am already having to replace them. They seem to have a lot of problems and I was hoping they would be better and cheaper than I am paying.    Rated 1 out of 5 by Mark from Not a good router. I had a few older devices like an old Macbook Air, and a Nokia Lumia 928. But I wanted the latest and greatest so, I purchased this router. It was a great buy. But my main reason for the purchase was for the extra bandwidth and wireless speeds. Unfortunately, the router is not reliable at all. I was not able to stream videos or any movies. I tried to stream a video from Amazon that had a great rating and the router would not do anything except buffering the video and then resetting to a lower quality. I am now trying to contact customer service about this. I will be cancelling my purchase and returning the router.  My wife and I use this to add extra capacity to our home wired network. The wifi range is great, but the connection speeds are not great. We have both used it in the past day and had to reset the router to get the connection to work again. I guess we will have to wait until it is on sale again to get another one.  I bought this because it was the cheapest option at the time. I have had it for about a week now and I have to say that it was a let down. I started using it about a month ago and I had some of the most frustrating experience using a router in my life. I plugged my laptop into the router via a USB and tried to access the internet. The only way I could access the Internet was to download a large file (at about 15gb or so) and then copy it to my phone and transfer it to the router (which did not work). So I started researching, and found that the router's default password is "admin". That is my fault, I was looking around looking at other routers and I typed the wrong password. When I tried it again, the same thing happened. After about 10 minutes of looking around online to see what others had done and found the problem. This has caused me to give up and never use another router again.  a good but old router from 2007

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he really liked the design of it and how it looks so well made. However he tried to charge it with a standard wall plug but he got a very strange response as in it would turn on and then turn off but would not charge, he tried turning it off and on again and it still refused to charge but this continued to happen every time he tried. I was in tears at this point so I got this bad boy from a friend and after a lot of back and forth with my friend I finally got it to charge (after my friend charged the battery for me) and then tried to turn it off to see if that would work as he had told me it would, when it would not turn on it just stayed on and would not start up, so I knew there was something wrong with the device (at that time I had it plugged into my computer) so I had to try everything to get it to work again but nothing worked.   It also started buzzing constantly but I'm pretty sure this is just the charger and I didn't even notice until I noticed the buzzing. This is the second one I have bought and I have been very happy with both of them but I will not be purchasing anymore.

When you put it in your pocket, you get a lot of music for your money and a little bit more volume for your speakers.  However, my husband loves it, he just has to be in a very quiet place to use it. If i was a business owner, i would buy more and more of these and give it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because the color was a little light, but the unit is just a bit flimsy and the batteries that come with it (2) were all dead. I've read that some have reported battery life to be very long, so I thought this would be a good replacement. I didn't like the color so I had to return it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are some great things that I have used with the X5 and this is just one.   This is my first real USB keyboard and I have to say, this keyboard has saved me from the pain of buying one before I had one of my own. I don't know how many times I've accidentally opened the lid of my bag, left the bag closed for 2 minutes and then accidentally turned on my computer and hit a key and had to close the bag. I didn't do it so often but this time I had to get back to my PC with my bag open. If I knew I'd been typing on a bad keyboard, I never would have bought one. I'm actually using this one for work on the X7 as well as my MacBook Pro!    What I liked about this product:  I just got this yesterday. I have been using this keyboard for about a month. So far so good. I really like the touchpad. The software is intuitive and very easy to use. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to customize the keyboard. The X3 had that. I just wish I could have customized the keys to be either a left or right arrow key. I think it would make the keyboard feel more natural, even if I can't change that right now.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device is a waste of money to buy and the warranty is poor.   It is a simple case that is made cheaply.  The screen is low resolution and has a low resolution touch screen.  It takes about 1 hour to charge and about 5-10 minutes to boot up.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from Great Purchase. Well designed for the price. This works as advertised. I love the built-in GPS and the built in bluetooth. Very pleased!  Rating
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    " I got an electronic calendar with no back up that will only show a day or 2 of events and then I must write a few sentences about why I don't use it anymore. "  A great feature to have, is a backup option for your devices.  I bought this calendar because I wanted a physical calendar, and the physical calendar came with one, so I figured I would add one as well.  to be frank, I donÂ´t know why I waited so long to get this. After all, I didnÂ´t need a physical planner because I have a pretty good digital one in my iPhone. And for $3, it is an amazing deal, especially when you have a nice physical one you can take with you wherever you go, and I know this because I did just that when I bought mine a couple of years ago. It has been almost a year since I bought it. When I look at it I see a piece of garbage, which I am not going to be doing again. It's a waste of money. I am already starting to get the idea that if I can save money buying my meals on the internet then I can buy my planner for a fraction of the cost. So what is the use of having this if you don't need it? The only good thing that it has is the back-up feature. But, that is so not an option. If you only use a small percentage of your days then the back up is a nice feature, but if you use a lot of days then you are already screwed with a back up of the paper version of your calendar, which is also a waste. But even then, I would never buy this calendar again. I think I'll save my money for a physical paper planner. . I have seen the original version of this planner, and when I saw it, I was shocked. The paper was thin and thin and the colors were dull as hell. I know a lot about planners but I thought I would like it better. When the organizer came in it was even more shocking. So, it came in two different sizes, one with 24 months, and one with 36 months. Now this is a big deal for a planner and not just one of the reasons that make it great. The calendar can be used as a monthly calendar, with day numbers, or a weekly calendar. You can have two months of a specific month on each day, or set
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This one was the only thing I could afford.   I ordered it online from the US as my main pc doesn't have a hard drive, so buying a cheap external hard drive for my laptop was the best solution. It works, however, if you have two of them connected to the same pc, you may have a bad time.  The case was very thin, as usual, and the rubber was very cheap, so don't get used to it and expect it to last.  It takes a long time to load programs and my graphics card doesn't work very well either. If I had money, I'd buy a real computer. But the case has its virtues.  I hope this review helps someone and that they don't make the same mistake that I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the first time I used a smartwatch for a few days, and I must say that it is a complete dud. I am not using it for a smart watch as I do not have a smartphone, so there are no apps available to access the features it can offer. The watch only records seconds, so you get a single, blank, image on the screen, for each second, so no more than 4 seconds can be shown at any one time. It has a single button on the side to interact with the device. I find that the watch has limited battery life and that the screen can become unreadable if you move it too much, so it's not really a smart device to me.  A smartwatch I don't like as much:  In the past I have reviewed a few other smart watches and found them pretty good. I thought the Moto 360 was the best smart watch on the market because of the great battery life. However, the newer Samsung Gear S is a very nice smart watch because of its great display, and the ability to control music and photos from the watch. In terms of features, it seems that I'm getting the worst of both worlds, because the watch features a few features, like the ability read SMS messages from my phone, but it has no way to do it well. It also has no ability to play music, and its screen is extremely small (the size of a watch, which is actually large, but only in comparison to your wrist), so it is not a good way to watch music. The device also has an incredibly slow processor which can cause the device to lag (and lag when you push the wrong buttons on the watch), and in some situations I found the screen would not read properly. All in all, it was a great watch and is a perfect size for my wrist. However it still is a watch to look at and not use as it doesn't offer the features I'm looking for.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The new iPad is a great, great tablet.   It's great if you're going on vacation and want to have the ability to see a big picture.  It just doesn't get good reviews when you look at the specs.  If you're not a graphic designer or a music/video artist, this will not be your tablet. Also, if your reading this, I know you're in the business and you know better.  Don't get me wrong, this tablet is good.  I got this tablet for a friend of mine who's a graphic artist and he loved it, but he's also a music producer and has to have music on his iPad.  He's also not a very tech savvy guy.  There are lots of apps that are great, but this one is not a great iPad app.  The best app is the Google Play Music.  This would have been better without having to have a Google account to access Google Play.  I'm also a bit disappointed that you had to wait 4-5 days for this tablet to ship out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device worked great until I upgraded to the wireless (I also have a wired iPod Classic). The Bluetooth signal was very poor. I have also read people have experienced the same problem. The first time I tried to transfer my music to my wireless device, the transfer was very slow. The second time I attempted to do the same, my music was corrupted. Also, the connection was very intermittent. It is now more like 5% of the time. If it is that good, why do people complain about it?    A negative review is more than likely a product of its time and not of what the device is supposed to do:  To connect two devices to each other. The Apple Wireless Keyboard is the only wireless device I have owned that does not support wireless audio.   My review has not been reviewed. This item has been discontinued by Apple.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i bought this unit a couple of weeks ago, and i found out about the bug after i had used it for a while, and theres not a whole lot you can do about that, i've seen several people post on this site that say the exact same thing about their iMacs being buggy and they are in a rush to have their iDevices fixed.   this is a really bad thing, if you're having problems with a specific application or the like, it shouldnt matter if it's a Mac or not, but when it comes to computers, the first generation model has bugs and other problems, and everytime it comes up, the people complaining about the same thing are in the exact situation i was, and they can't figure it out until they are wayyyy back to the same old iMac that they purchased their iComputer from, so when the bugs are in multiple iDevice models, it's really just a bad way to buy a computer, and that is if you like spending money on a computer for yourself or anyone else, i would say, this model is a good way to get a computer if you just want something that doesn't require any more setup or anything, if it can get the job done, the iMac is a great computer, i wouldn't recommend buying a computer over the i7 because it can overclock quite a bit faster than the i5, and if you want more storage for your files then go for the i8, but if you are just in the middle, this one does it all, and it has a good price to it for what you get, i'd give it a full 5 stars if it had the possibility to be bugfree, but sadly its not,   Review by: mike l on May 24, 2014 :  i bought the i-Mac and when i opened it and plugged it in i saw the black screen with a blue background. It had this red light blinking for about a minute then died for the last time. when i powered it back on and restarted it did not do this. It also has this big yellow light that turns on and off.  Also when i was trying to update the OS X kernel i was told there was a problem. I tried to do a clean install of the i4, it did nothing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had a lot of electronic devices that work and are just so-so. These don't even make me go "Oh, that's the best gadget I've ever used", they just don't have enough function or features to justify their price tag.   I've had the Samsung Chromebook for 2 years now and I absolutely LOVE IT. The keyboard is the best and the touchpad is amazing! I don't use this device as much as I use my iPad which is a Macbook Air.  The only con I could really find is the screen is a little dull for my liking. Other than that I love this device! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Innovation: 8/10Â  This is an all-in-one remote for theÂ   Â Play Station 3. I would have preferred a remote for another version of the device. The buttons were all the same, which could be a negative. I also did not like that the remote is designed to be used with a standard TV remote. For a system to have a better remote than the stock remote, it should have one that would work with most TVs, not just a few.Â  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the 2nd time I bought a wireless keyboard. First one was on a new computer. The second one I used for a year but it stopped working because of the same problems. It just doesn't look nice, feels too big, the key spacing is too big. I hate the keyboard. I don't care if I can use it to type. I use it for games so I can hit keys faster. So why can't I use this thing? I hate it. Don't waste your money. If it's not broken don't fix it. Get a new keyboard.  Rated 1 out of 5 by J-A from Broken! After only two weeks of ownership, the wireless keyboard broke. I bought it on a sale for $40 after the first day. The key spacing was great when I first installed it on my macbook. However, it's just too tight to type without turning my wrist around.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first tried to purchase a   cheap   Apple   iPod Touch   on eBay  , it   failed me in a big way.   It   wouldn't charge.  And when I would plug it in, it Â would Â power on but would Â not record anything.  When the seller said that he would not pay for the repair,   I was just ready to give up and go buy one at an Apple Store.  But a  friend of a friend mentioned the same model on Craigslist.  I contacted the seller and asked if   he had ever had any problems.  He told me the iPod Touch would not turn on and he would need to get it repaired. I contacted Apple Care for   me and they told me to get a second opinion. They sent me to their Genius Bar for my second opinion and they found the problem.  The iPod Touch will not turn and power on.  To be honest, the iPod touch is much more expensive than   any other   mobile device I have tried.  They should have a free replacement or refund if the problem is discovered in a few days or so.  If you have a bad iPod Touch, don't be afraid to ask for a refund or exchange. Â It   might be a good idea to ask a friend to help you out.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned a Macbook Pro for more than a year and I am so disappointed in its performance and durability. After being on the road for several months, I dropped my iMac Air and the LCD cracked within one day. After calling apple about the issue, the representative assured me that this is an Apple issue. After waiting for almost 6 weeks, the iMac is finally arriving (i had to buy a new Apple store gift card to get it to show up). The screen is still cracked and the internal components are clearly not up to par, so it's a no-go to be using this machine. I'm glad I went with the HP, but I am not so thrilled with the quality of the i3 and the screen's cracked nature means I will probably have to wait for my next purchase of a Mac.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You'll likely be told to get a different brand   because this one does not work well with a certain computer   and other devices   not that it makes a difference   If your computer has a low-end processor, you might want to look elsewhere   for a good portable computer   :  The first thing that strikes me is how cheap this unit is. I can't imagine the quality they are putting out these days.   The batteries are not rechargeable, but they work when you need them.  Â  The back light is okay for night time viewing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst bluetooth speaker I have ever had to purchase. My wife purchased this for me to listen to her podcasts, but when I was listening I heard constant buzzing/beeping, it would not shut off. I tried to power it down, but it would only power on if it was in a pocket, and when I took it out of the pocket and put it on my table, it just started buzzing again. I was so upset that I had to return it. I would NEVER BUY THIS COMPANY.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I can remember back when I bought this i was a little disappointed. The first time I opened it, it took 2 minutes before the power button would turn on. When I went to use it, the keyboard took forever to register my key presses. I was afraid the unit was bad and it was. I have tried a lot of different devices and none have been as sluggish as the one from LG. I had the same issues with other models and even had to return it. Don't get this unless you know what you are getting. The battery life was the only thing I liked about this model.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We bought theÂ  Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Â and our experience isÂ terrible   I bought the phone because I'm addicted to social networking apps on my mobile devices.Â  However the app doesn't work at all   The first thing that I noticed is that the Galaxy Note was a little heavy. The screen was bigger than a smartphone and you could only use it when the screen was turned off.Â I had to set the phone down twice in a row.Â  The device is very easy to handle.   It is lightweight but the battery power is not great.  You have to unplug the battery every time and it's a pain to do it.  It was nice having a screen, but I can't recommend the device   If you are an addict of social networking you should not buy this product because the software is too difficult to use    Now the screen is good and you can use it while it's turned off but you have to remember to plug the battery in to prevent the device from getting cold.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very surprised to find a device which performs as good as the other top-of-the-line models and cost less than the competition.   The problem I have with this device is the lack of battery life.   The unit can't handle more than 8 hours of use before the battery becomes depleted.  This is more than double the time it takes the other models.  You have to charge the unit at least once a month to avoid losing all your valuable data. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     5/5 - Very impressed. I bought this to replace a broken iphone 6 plus and the iPhone 4 Plus. The design and functionality of this phone is very nice, but I was very disappointed in the display, the touch buttons are too small and the iphonelock is just wrong, I have to open my phone by a few millimeters to unlock it.  - Great phone, great performance. The phone is the first to give me a full screen view. The other phones I've had are much larger and less elegant. The screen has a black bar with a color border around it. You can easily see the buttons and screen when you're looking at it directly.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You must understand that the price is not the problem, it is the fact that it cannot be charged or has bad batteries. I bought this because it has a very good picture and decent sound. It is now one of my favorite speakers on my phone. The only thing that I don't like is that it will not charge. I am trying to use the 3.7V 2200 mAh battery but I can only charge it up to 1.4A at the best. I wish that there was a way to charge it, but I think that the issue is related to the battery as well. The other thing is that when you plug in the speaker the screen gets very dark. The volume is pretty loud and it is very clear. I do not have an external power brick because my wall outlet is not powerful enough. It may also have been that my wall is pretty old. I used it as a speaker on my desk, but my wife complained that the sound was too much like a car stereo.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In a sense, the first part of the story, which I am sure most of you have already read and will not be shocked to hear about: On October 3rd, 2010, a man, named George, left his home in Virginia, to drive to Baltimore to get a friend to a funeral. When he got to Baltimore, he was not feeling well so he stayed home. On the evening of October 4th, he suddenly felt extremely ill. He got in his car and drove as far as he could and was still feeling a little worse. At this point, he called his friend, whom he hadn't seen in weeks. When the friend arrived, he found the man collapsed on the floor of his car. He pulled the man out and then called 911. His friend was called as well, but had to take the man to the hospital first.   Once on the hospital floor, the man died from a heart attack.  How I feel about this.  This is pretty much how I feel whenever I have a fever and the only thing that keeps me from dropping dead and being replaced by a zombie is the power of positive thinking.  Â  The death of this man left his friend feeling devastated. She called 911, but unfortunately she was already in the ER. She went in and found George. He had a broken neck from a fall. Now, at first the story is that he just went on to his death and nobody died, but this is not how things go.  It has turned out that George's friend, who was the one that called 911 first, was found unconscious on the scene. He was in critical condition and not expected to live. The hospital staff performed CPR to try and save his life, but sadly his efforts were not enough.  He was declared dead at 2:36 AM (the time when his friend arrived in the hospital).  The family has been told that he had an infection that made him extremely susceptible to heart problems and that he was in a hospital for a long time, possibly the entire day or so, before he passed away. Â  It is the last thing I want to know about a story like this but there is no doubt in my mind that this man was so sick, that he could have done so much more than he did. That his friend (who was in the right place at the right time, so to speak) should have been there before he did all that he
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first started using this unit in 2013, I thought the whole experience was awesome.   I can use my PC as a standalone unit and run my full gaming rig on it.  I have several other older computers that I use for my personal projects and use my computer as a workstation every day.  But this unit has made things more convenient.  It has provided me with a portable gaming machine for when I am on a trip or away.  However, I have had two issues with the unit.  First, the USB port that is the one for a keyboard and mouse did not work for me until I purchased a dongle for my keyboard.  Then I needed a dumpster-type device to install a newer operating system on the computer, as that was one of the requirements of my review.  Finally, I did not like the fact that the unit only has two USB ports.  My solution for those problems was to go with a more expensive external USB hub.  Since purchasing the unit, I also have started to go through the device's user manual every time I use it to make sure I am fully aware of what is the most convenient way to do the things I want to do.  So if you like a great compact gaming machine but do not need a full-blown desktop, and do not care about gaming rig compatibility,   then the Corsair Gaming K70-X is an awesome choice for you.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:       The unit is nice to have in your home. I was not sure about the durability of the unit. It lasted 4 months with moderate use, but some of the contacts began to show signs of wear. After a year, the batteries were showing signs of corrosion and the units were not easy to turn on. The unit came with two cables and they were fine, but the unit did not come with a power cord. I ended up using a long extension cord from a house outlet to get the unit to turn. I also ended up getting a battery grip which worked fine.   I had some trouble getting the batteries to hold an charge at first. They kept dropping out as I was adjusting the batteries. Once I got the hang of it and changed the batteries, I found they did not drop out as often. They last longer than the other chargers I have used.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Rene from Great price and charger but... I bought the AC charger for my Apple 15" notebook computer. I use this for my iPad and iPad 2 and it works great, for $30, you can't go wrong. You can buy a better charger, I got it from another store, but you can get better batteries on ebay for under a dollar. It will last you a long time. The downside is the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You get a nice looking unit.   It looks good and the power management is OK.  The software can be a bit more user friendly.  It is possible to disable the sleep feature on this unit. However, I would like to see the ability to disable sleep when power is low.  This is an amazing device. I purchased the S5 for work as a portable hard drive. It is extremely durable and the design is extremely sturdy. You would expect a product of this kind to last longer but that is not the case. I have had mine for about 10 months. It still looks brand new and works great. I highly recommend this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is the best phone I've ever owned! I have been looking for a phone that is good at everything. The screen is beautiful, it can hold a lot, and the build quality is amazing. I was worried that it was going to be an android because of the price, but this thing is amazing! It is easy to use, has tons of functions, and has lots of storage space to keep all of my music, pictures, and apps. The only thing I would change is that the software is a bit buggy. I am not sure why, but there are times that it goes through the motions for a few seconds then it seems to freeze up. Overall it is the perfect phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the case of a laptop, you can just install the drivers from an online installer.   Most likely, the install will be an upgrade from the last one.  However, in the case when you can't find the driver, or the version you want is out of date, you'll have to install it manually from the manufacturer's website.  The procedure can be a bit more involved, but I managed to get it running from an external drive and it didn't fail me.  After a little bit of tweaking, it started working perfectly.  I like that it was so cheap.  Unfortunately, it's a little slower than I'm used to.  It takes me 15-20 seconds to select the "start" key to activate it.  Even in the lightest load, it took a bit over 1 second to bring the computer up to full speed.  Now, I can see the computer is busy loading the drivers, so I have to wait some time. Â   The keyboard isn't very smooth, but this is a minor gripe. I didn't want to spend much on a laptop if I could do a good job typing on it. Overall, it works like a charm, even though it's not the most responsive keyboard on the market. Rated 4 out of 5 by mrsjoe from Just ok I bought this to replace my laptop's original Dell XPS 13. I was happy to find that this one has a full-size keyboard, which is better than the keyboard on my laptop. It's a touch-sensitive surface, which I was fine with, although the cursor sometimes disappears in certain apps. There's nothing I'd change about this laptop. I only wish it came with a faster SSD. It took about 30 minutes to install the driver.  Rated 5 out of five by Mike from Great purchase My wife was the buyer for this laptop at a local Best Buy. I am a big fan of Dell products but had to wait a couple weeks for the delivery so I could get it. The screen was on sale for the same price as the laptop but I went with a refurbished model instead. My wife did all the work to restore it so this is what I used. We both enjoy our new laptops and our kids love them. I use the keyboard for work and typing email but it is good for the occasional game. So far I am very pleased with this product and will purchase a new one in
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used to work at a computer repair shop.   A very good shop with an old monitor and a very nice monitor.  When I was in the shop, one day, I asked the guy what was wrong with his monitor. He said that he had to send it back because it had become so smudgy that he could see his hand print on it.  After I bought it, I couldn't help but think that I should have done the same.  It's still working perfectly.  The only thing is that it's a little hard to see the screen if you're standing up, and you have to adjust your vision when you get on a bed to see properly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When it came to my new NEX-7 (after I replaced my old NEX 5), it was a piece of junk. I'd recommend that no one buys this camera. I'm looking to do a long exposure, but it would have been much better to use an older NEX or NEX 6. A little too bulky, and you have to get very precise with your exposure, and it can't autofocus. If you want a great photo, buy an Olympus TG-3.   I bought my first DSLR, the NEX 10, in 2001, and I loved it. The NEX 9 was a huge disappointment; it was heavy, bulky, had slow autofocusing, and only offered 4 fps. I wanted to go back to a more compact system.  My NEX 3. The 8MP sensor was an improvement, but the autofocused speed was still painfully slow. The autofilter worked, but I missed the ability to preview photos on the LCD before shooting. I was a happy camper, but not impressed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst purchase I've ever made. First, this is a terrible device for the price. It has a small backlight that gets in the way of your screen and is incredibly flimsy and has some very noticeable gaps around the edges. The keyboard is awful and the touchpad is just as terrible. It's too small to be comfortable to type on. The speakers are so loud that the only time you can hear anything besides the music is when your computer is in use and you are literally sitting in front of it, the only times it can pick up sound is if you play something loud. The microphone is also poor, if you're going to use this device to record audio, then buy a dedicated recorder. You'll be glad you did. If you are planning on using it for a media centre or something else, get a separate computer for this purpose. You will get use out of it for about 1 month.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Just Junk! After spending close to $200 on a MacBook Pro for a work machine, this was one of the most disappointing purchases I've made this year. The keypad has a lot of backlight leakage which is distracting to the computer's keyboard, and the speakers are too loud to bother with. I even tried using the keyboard and trackpad in portrait mode and they both had to be flipped sideways. I could not use either the keyboard or trackpad, so this is simply a flimsy piece of junk, and does not meet the minimal specs required for a Mac. This is easily the worst Mac purchase I have made so far this year...
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -   Â  - Â - Â + Â ---  - -  - --- -   : The screen on this device is extremely small. The top of the display is so tiny that you can't really see the rest of the screen. I had to look down at the display to be able to even see what was on the screen (and it wasn't even all the way across the screen). Even the back of the device is small. There's not much of an interface with the display on it. It feels so cheap and flimsy when holding the device, especially the size of the bezel. My biggest issue with this device was the fact that I could not use the remote for any reason. It's not that it was difficult to use, it just didn't work as well as I would have liked. There is no button to push to wake the display or even start the music on the device. The headphone jack was also a huge deal breaker for me, as there's just nothing on the headphone jack other than the power button for the device that I'm using. The buttons on the front are way too small.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's a good toy. The vibrations are nice and strong but are definitely not strong enough to get a good deep orgasm, nor to satisfy a person looking for some light vaginal stimulation. As you may have guessed, the size and price are not a great match for me (I'm a medium-sized woman and it's too long for me), so I can't really recommend this for anyone other than someone looking for something with a similar feeling to a dildo but with a bigger size.  Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: Anonymous - Verified Buyer Very nice device. No issues at all, just works as intended. I'm 5'4" and the dildo works well. I got it for my wife. I bought this for myself as an upgrade to my old dildo and I think it's a great product. The design is great as it's not the typical hard plastic dildo that you get. It's not as long and doesn't have the girth like other hard plastic models and has a small head so you can take it all in for a better experience. For me, this was a perfect addition to my arsenal. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  and I've just bought another one just to put on a shelf in the bedroom (its got the same length, so my wife can't see the gaping hole), the little hole looks awesome as you can see from the video. And the hole is just too small for the rest of my body. But a good purchase if you love a good hole. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful I am very disappointed. I had high expectations of this item but it is very disappointing. First I want to state that I have a good experience using this dildo. I usually enjoy the G-Spot stimulation but this is much too wide. I don't think it is meant to be taken into the vagina like a normal penis but more of a butt plug. I was going to give it 4 stars but the shaft is so thick it feels like I'm being crushed and pushed to the backside, making my experience very difficult. The width makes it hard to thrust it in and out and even if it was a little bit wider, it is not nearly the size of a normal dildo so I could not use it the way I intended to. The shaft is also too thick for me to insert the base of it in. I do not recommend
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing's a piece of shit. It's very easy to accidentally hit the power button, and you can't do anything about it. It also takes 2 batteries and you have to use a case. If you're looking for a good deal, then this is for you. If not, then don't buy it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     It would be cool if the phone would turn off when I take it from my pocket  This is the 3rd time I have had to return a Samsung phone and the last 2 were due to poor service. The device on this particular phone seems to have an internal bug which prevents it from working correctly. The screen appears to be a bit too bright at night when turned off and during the day when on the charging cord. The phone will not turn off, and even when plugged into a USB port, the phone will continue to show the green light in its status light for about 3-4 hours. It is only when it is connected to a USB charger that the phone turns off. I contacted Samsung and they confirmed it is an internal problem and have already sent a new unit to me. The service manager is very nice but she has been very rude when I have questioned why I am having this problem and why my phone is so slow to turn off after taking it off the charger.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't know what else to say but I'm very disappointed with this product. I bought this about a week ago. I've had a few different phones before but this is a first for me. There are two main problems. One is that the display is really ugly and can't be changed to anything less than black and white (and I know that it should be black and a white but I want to show off my shiny new iPhone 4, so I can go and buy a case and a couple of other things). I donÂ´t mind so much that itÂ´s ugly but I don`t like the fact that there's no volume up/down and itÂ´ll automatically switch to airplane mode when you are playing with your phone, but will not work properly. Also, the screen is really low resolution. I have no idea how Apple made it look so good. It is a shame because it should have been available at a lower price point but there are so many good devices out there, including a lot of phones that can be even better. If you just want a good Android phone with a good screen at a good price, go with the Galaxy S2 and S3. The S2 costs $130 and has a 1080p screen and a better battery. There is a way to downgrade this one to 1080p (which is really close to the 1080p in iPhone 4) for a cheaper price but itÂ´d be a bit disappointing. The other problem is that it canÂ´t use a 3.5mm plug or a micro usb port. I had it for a couple days and it worked great for a while but the battery got really low and I lost my connection with it a couple weeks ago. And the final problem is the battery life. I'm not sure if itÂ´t working in this particular case but it should at least have about 7 hours or so. I can only imagine if you have to charge this every night. If I canÂ´n live without it I will probably get another one of these in the future but i would rather wait for a better device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the worst cases of overkill you can come across! I ordered 2 of these and received two different types, the 2nd one was slightly different in shape from the first one. The only difference is that one has a button that allows for the removal of the batteries but the other one has only a micro switch. The first one was faulty from the start. The device would only work for a minute or two but then would not function at all. The second one however worked fine from the beginning and then wouldn't work. My second one worked all night long but then it suddenly would not operate. I returned the second one and ordered a replacement which arrived a few days later. It is working great now.

This is a nice device, the screen is nice, the battery life is great, and the speaker is amazing! The only problem is the battery. I use it every day, for 3 hours at a time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst smartphone ever!   I bought it as a backup phone, but it's been a terrible companion.   It's very buggy.  I had to reset it a few times because it would randomly reboot, and I had forgotten to turn it off.  When I got it, it was really slow, and you had to push a button for it to do anything.  It has the worst display ever. It is incredibly laggy, and it always freezes.  The screen is very black, and the text is all washed out.  My friends say that if I put it on a table, it would look like a piece of scrap paper, so it's terrible.  One of the buttons is the wrong color for the other button.  What I would like is a more user-friendly menu system for choosing which apps are on, but I don't know what that will do.  As a business owner, I would get a different model of this.   Was this review helpful to you? YES ( 1 ) | NO ( 0 )  Great phone, horrible software. by: btman1 - 09/29/2015  Comfort: Durability: Value: I bought this phone as my primary phone for my work, and even though it isn't top of my "want" list anymore, I think it's worth it because of the features it offers. First, it has a great camera and screen (my main reason for buying it), but there's so much to this phone that I wish I could take pictures with it! I have to turn the camera on by itself every time I take a picture. It also has a very limited memory, which I know is common with android phones, but is still frustrating. Also, the touch screen on this phone has a tendency to have the screen light up at weird times, and if I press it too hard, it can take a second or two to go from white to black. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase. If you're looking for a great phone and don't want to have a lot of apps, or like to have tons of data on your phone, this is the phone for you.  Pros: Good camera, Good battery life, Good value, Great price for a device that doesn't perform like a flagship phone, and good screen, and great battery life for a mid-range device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only reason that I bought this device is that I needed a "do-it-all" device that could connect to an iPad or iPhone via USB. This is the only device I've owned that could do that. However, the user interface is horrible. Even after you've downloaded a couple of apps and added a few songs to your iTunes collection, the device still has lots of issues with the touch-screen. If you don't have a good tablet or smart phone, then this is your only option. If this is the type of device that you want, buy the Apple version  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned and used this product for 3 months now. So far it is good quality.

It did the job though, but only if you have a good sound system that can handle it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I tried this a month ago, as an experiment for my family to see how well it would work. We used it all at the same time and for the most part it worked very well. It was difficult to use at first but once you get used to it it's pretty simple. My only complaint is that the button doesn't stay pressed very long after you first put it in. I got very frustrated because I knew I could use my computer normally to work until my wife got home, and now I couldn't. We tried to get it to work in another room, but that just makes it worse. I'm not sure what to do about it. I would recommend this to a friend, but it would probably only last a few months before it failed and we'd have to start over.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a new iPhone 6 Plus about a year ago. I loved it right out of the box, it had a better camera than my old, so I was more than happy to get one. However, about a month ago, my phone started having the issue of battery drains. Now I have to keep turning it off and on and on to charge. It's a pain in the ass. I've tried everything: turning it to airplane mode, moving it from charger to charger, and also removing the battery from the phone. The battery drains when the phone is in airplane mode or is moved from charger. I have the Verizon iPhone 6.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very excited about the Samsung S8, and the fact that Samsung is making it available to the masses through a carrier (T-Mobile) is an exciting new aspect of this device. So I expected great things from the phone. I was wrong.    It's not just a good phone, but a good bad one.  I love the S8. It's a beautiful phone. It has a lot of great features. The hardware is top notch. It looks and feels like a top of the line device. But, after using the phone, I've come to realize something. I've been a Samsung user for the last few years. Samsung has had a great track record on the Galaxy S phones. The S7 was excellent. The phone wasn't perfect, but it was a great product. The Galaxy S8 looks amazing. The screen is the best I've seen on a Samsung phone. The curved screen was a big change from the curved Galaxy S7. I love that the S7 has a flat back. I like how the back of the phone has a smooth metal finish. But the curved back on the S 8 has a bit of a rough look to it. The camera is fantastic. It is better than the LG G5 and Nexus 6P. The only thing holding it back from a perfect score is the fact the battery life is average, especially in comparison to the LG phones.  The S8 is a very nice phone, especially with the curved screen. It could have been a fantastic device, but Samsung let the marketing slide a little too far and lost the user experience.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was looking forward to upgrading to this laptop. It took longer than anticipated. I had to go on the Internet to find an answer to how to get Windows 10.   After buying it, I went into Settings, Personalization and put in my old computer's old name.

Posted by: L. at 4/15/2014 1:06:34 PM Â  As a person who uses a Windows laptop for work, the ability to easily upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 7 has been an absolute pleasure.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard on this is not very good, the arrow keys have a very loud click on the key press, and the backlighting is only red. It seems that they are only compatible with the Windows 8 version of Windows (the one you get when you upgrade to Windows 10, it does work on the older versions). The mouse on this can be set to "Click" (press the right mouse button to move the cursor), but the sensitivity is so low it's barely noticeable, I have to move my mouse with my left hand because it's too sensitive.   I can't recommend this keyboard at all, unless you use this with a Windows XP PC, or just can't live without Windows.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the watch, and immediately set it up. But, to my amazement the software failed completely. This was so bad, that I had to give up on it, and went to my friend's computer to check the software. It worked perfectly. But the watch itself, is very bad. You cannot set the time anywhere on the watch. To set the hour, you can only set it on your wrist. It seems that the "digital crown" is not really a crown, but rather is a touch pad, or buttons. The button that turns on the screen to show the time, does not work. I can only find it on the middle of the watch face, and it is very hard to push. The other problem is that you cannot set a daily alarm. You can set the date and hour, but not the time. The watch, on the other hand, can be set up in the morning and set, and works great. The only problem with the watch is the software, but it is easy to fix with a program you download.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the "Touchstone" to replace my old phone (iPhone 5). I used it for the first couple days and the phone was great until I lost a contact that came with it. When I got it back it just stopped working. I returned it but couldnt find a replacement at the time so I sent it back. I never got a replacement phone and now my phone is dead again.   I bought the Apple Pencil (or some similar) a couple months ago to replace a broken one. I had no idea it had a hard start feature until someone told me. I tried to put it on the computer and got it to turn on after a few attempts. I've been using the new Apple Pen for about 3 weeks now and I must say I am quite impressed. I am writing my college application for a bachelor's degree and am very pleased with the Apple software and how it all works. I bought this for my husband to use to write a few chapters for my new novel. He is now using it for school assignments. The only down side to this product is the battery life. Its a small tablet so the battery will need replacing soon but he is able to use it all day. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The new iPad. I really wanted the iPad Air, but I have been wanting a Retina screen for a long time now. I ordered this device with the hope of using the Retina display. I am disappointed. The display is washed out, which I expected considering the price. I'm a casual gamer, so the gaming experience on the iPad was a disappointment. I expected to be able to play a game on the airplane and not have to constantly switch devices. I also found that the device is not as good as it looks. I have tried a bunch of games and the quality isn't that great. I can't believe Apple would release a device at this price point that doesn't perform as well as they claim. I hope Apple addresses this problem in the future. I will not recommend this product to anyone. I would rather spend the extra money for a full sized iPad.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When it arrived, the case had a cracked screen (which the customer service rep said was normal for new products).  The unit was not in working order at all.  I was told that the replacement unit would cost a bit more than the original one (because it had the same battery).  I called customer service to find out the actual cost for the replacement, and the rep said it would be $49 (or $49.95, as I'm sure someone would have told me, but my impression was that it would cost $49).  In reality, it was $34.85.  As it turned out, the replacement screen would be sent to me by mail, which I have had to buy myself as I couldn't return the faulty unit to Apple.   Another issue I have is that this is not an Apple device but a generic Sony product.  Apple should have warned me ahead of time that the unit would not work correctly.  All in all, I'm not a big fan of this product, but I'd rather pay a bit extra to receive a product that does what it's supposed to do.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product works as advertised.  Rated 4 out of 5 by MollieB from Good for the price, but could do with a bit of tinkering. The keyboard was a little too high for my fingers and the buttons a little hard to get a good grip on, but otherwise a good buy. I've had a few problems with it but thankfully they don't happen every time. My biggest problem is with the way it is designed. The metal housing is held in by two little nuts that you twist to the left to detach the case from the keyboard. Unfortunately that means that you need a small screwdriver to get the case off as you have to do this every time you want to switch the keyboard back on. The problem with this is that the keys have a tendency to shift a little bit when you press the key or do something while the keyboard is in the closed position. It makes it tricky to get back into the right position if you're trying to use an app on the keyboard, or if you just want to try a game because it's not plugged in and the keyboard doesn't work. The keys also start to shift after a while, but it can be fixed in software. A few months of use and it's a little less frustrating. This thing has the same type of design as a Thinkpad keyboard, so for those who prefer it this is the best option. I bought it to use with the latest Windows 10 and the W10V does what it says on the tin. But this is only one example of a problem with the product. In my opinion, this product is overpriced, and it will probably only be useful if you are just a short walk away from a repair shop.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The new i-Phones have a new "feature" that makes them completely worthless.   This is a feature that I have been waiting for my entire life, the ability to put the i-Phone on and leave the battery charger plugged in and the phone on.  It makes it extremely hard for anyone to take a battery out of an electronic device without unplugging them from the charger.  I don't think anyone needs a $800 phone with this sort of feature, but the engineers at Apple knew better, and they went with this stupid feature, which will make it very difficult for someone to charge the phone properly without taking it apart. I bought a Nexus 4 just for this purpose.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only bad thing I had to do was to pay for the software (only) at one time. The problem is that I've been wanting to buy the PC for 3 months because I had used a laptop of mine for many years and it gave me some advantages over a computer. The only problem I had was that I was unable to turn it on, but there was a video clip showing you how to turn on and some other videos that showed you how it works. The other problem is the battery. It has a 30,000+ mAh capacity which is great but it does drain very fast, so it's very hard to use for more than a few hours at a time.   So far I've tried:  - Installed the software - Got a working computer and I'm pleased with the price I paid - No problems at all   I am happy with my purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The best way to describe this product is "boring" and "borrowed design".   I bought this product primarily to replace a $15-18.00 LCD monitor which is about the best $8-11 can buy and is great for gaming (I'm an average gamer).  Â This monitor however has a big flaw in the form of the screen.   It's flat with no angle so that means your sitting on top of the device rather than underneath.  (The monitor on the right is the monitor I used to buy from them)   This also means that if you sit on it you will definitely not be able to see the keyboard which is a major design flaw for the manufacturer.  You can use the monitor without the keyboard by moving it around.  This is not a big deal for me but I have heard that some other people have had issues with this.  The monitor itself is not that bad but is very flimsy and cheap looking.  I would recommend it if you are looking for a gaming monitor but do not get it if that's your primary purpose.  If you are just looking to use this monitor for casual gaming then it is fine but not ideal for my taste.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item hoping it would be the answer to my prayers. I had no need for an external hard drive when I was in school so I bought one in my name for $29 and now this and a few others are in storage. I used to have to buy these things (sometimes 2-3 at a time) from my school library at the beginning of the year to keep everything up to date and it was a real hassle. I think I have had 3 hard drives fail since that first purchase and now I just go to my school's library to buy new ones when they need them. My school does not give me the chance to return the hard drive or replacement as they are so expensive I cannot afford to buy a new one if my oldest one fails.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The speaker is very nice, but the sound isn't bad and it's very clear. My only concern is the fact that the USB charging port is under a screw, which means that the battery won't last much longer.  by Daniel
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery lasted all of 9 hours. No more than that. The only way this works is if you set it to its highest setting and crank it to get it to charge. The charging is also very slow. I was hoping it would charge super fast, but it would take an hour or two and then it would stop. You can do this by turning off the device but that defeats the purpose. For my small phone, it is not worth the extra $50-$100. For someone with a larger phone, I might consider it, but the battery is only good for 9 hours or so, not a whole day. Also, I think the buttons are a little tricky to press. I had to put the device on the table a few times to get the buttons to work. A nice looking charger with nice features.   One of my goals is to buy a good quality device at a low price, and the Mophie Juice Pack is exactly that. It charges my smartphone very quickly, with a nice battery that lasts a long time. I don't think I will ever have to spend a lot of money on charging my iPhone again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first purchased this, the screen was not very bright, but after 3 days it was bright enough. I don't know if it was the screen, or the fact that my device is a phone, but I have noticed that my voice calls are not very clear. They sound like they are coming from the phone speaker in my pocket. Not sure if this is a hardware issue or software issue. I like the screen on the Droid 5, but if you are planning to purchase this one, you should have it in a different color. I hope this review helps!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love my iPhone. I don't have a ton of room in my pocket, but it's perfect for when I don it for a quick read or quick email, and it still has plenty of power. However, I'm getting older and want more out of my phone. I just can't stand the way it's hard to unlock or it's so slow on my iphone. I really wish it had wireless charging or a headphone jack. If the iPhone didn't have wireless charging I'd be totally fine with the iphony. I also just don't like the way they put the screen up on the sides. That's the only reason I don t like it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price is good for a good battery:  This was my first time trying an eGo. I'm so glad I did, but my experience with this device was a little strange. I received this device a little over a month ago. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to say this is my most favorite e-liquid yet.    I've been trying different tanks.  I had to do a little research on a coil to use: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the Z2 and it's a good device but not one that I would recommend to others.   My main problem with this device is the small battery life. The battery lasts only a few hours for me so I have to charge it about every 5-6 days. If you're like me and need the battery life you get, then this is a good product but not for me. I am looking for a replacement for my Z2.   I bought the Z1 and wanted the Z4 so when the Z3 came out, I was very happy.  The only bad part is that the battery can go dead very quickly, so it's really only good for a day or two at most.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You can't use this at all unless you want to burn through batteries in the next two weeks, and then you are going to have a bad time.   I bought the 3G version for $80 to replace my old Droid 3 with this one. I thought I could live without the 3g though because the battery life on it was less than what the new Droid 4 had. Well that was my assumption until I got the Moto X and went to use it every day for a month.  This phone is horrible in every way. It has no speed, no camera, no good sound, no wireless signal, and no water resistance (I had to put it in a waterproof case). It's an old style phone that doesn't use micro-usb, and it uses the old technology that the new model doesn't. It's the worst thing you can get from Motorola.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very good I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S8 with this and the 3rd generation iPhone 7. I'm happy with both of them. The S8 has great cameras with fast focus and good image quality, but the iPhone seems to be a lot faster and has better audio. The Motorola phone has a better battery life but I have to use the battery saver mode, and I just switch it on when it gets low.  the 3GB version has better RAM, but is slower. I like to have the same phone on the go as I do at home. I got this phone because I use the Moto 360 and it was hard to use with the MotoX because it was a huge pain. The Moto X is easy to use. The only problem is I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to get it out of my house because it's so heavy.  and now it is just perfect I'm having fun using this phone and I love it I just have to buy one for myself soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - I love this phone, but I wish I could use this on my landline. It is a good phone, except when I have my land line in the house, which is what I use it for most of the time. It just does not have a place where I can put a phone and make calls while I am away from the house.     I would rate the phone a 4 out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "It was a good thing it wasn't broken. I had just installed the new screen and screen door on the screen and I was expecting the computer to work fine at the moment. But the next thing I know my monitor went blank and was not working until I opened the lid. I think the display was too small and was hard to read at all. All in all, this thing was a waste of money."  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Solid, versatile and affordable I have the monitor for my home theatre and have been very happy with it. It is the second screen I have bought from B&H and the first has exceeded all my expectations. I did a little research on different screen options and came across this model. It was more than just what I expected. It comes with three screen stand adapters. The stand is sturdy and well built and comes with a set of clips to put it into position for the right viewing position. The screen has a built in remote and the remote has a very good range. I was surprised to find the remote had a built-in IR blaster so that I could use the IR blaster on the TV and the monitor in tandem to get the best picture. The resolution is high and the color gamut is perfect. The built in speakers and microphone are good. The only disappointment was that there was a small gap on the right of the monitor that the screen could not sit flat on, this is not too big an issue as I use a desktop monitor so it is not a big deal.  5 out of 1 found this review helpful I was very impressed with the size and clarity. I didn't expect such good clarity for the price point. The input lag on a modern high end card is not noticeable on the display. The refresh rate of 144Hz was also very impressive. For the price I was worried that I would have to add a monitor that was higher end, but this monitor is a great option for those who want a great resolution at a very reasonable price point
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â -Â Â If you want to replace a broken screen, you have to pay the dealer $100 to $300+ for the screen and a complete replacement.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first one I bought had a very bad "pop" at the top that you had to turn off, but it had good sound quality and it came with a case. However, the case broke the first time it was taken to an "out of the box" (aka unassembled) repair shop. The second one didn't have this problem, but the buttons were mushy, which caused the device to have a loud click.  You might consider these for home theater and music/music/movies (both mono).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great little device. Its small, lightweight, light and has nice features. However, it is not without flaws. When it comes to making phone calls, the sound quality is great but you have to turn it on and off every couple of minutes. It takes about 2 seconds for the device to get in your pocket. I would recommend getting a good quality earphone for phone calls. Otherwise, I would buy a second unit and use it as an earphone. Overall a good product for the price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I think these things are pretty cool, but they've been so overpriced, even at full retail prices, that I've found myself replacing them so often that I'm actually looking forward to their departure.   My main issue with the T60s is that they seem to have such limited battery life.  When I was out of juice the laptop would turn off immediately, or go into sleep mode.  I could not tell if the batteries were in.  For a $500 computer, that's really not a good sign.  Other than that, they're a cool device.  Posted by Steve Jones at 4:56 PM
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â What I like: The fact that you can easily adjust the volume and mute/unmute the Bluetooth connection. The fact the Bluetooth is very easy to use and that there are no cords that get tangled. I love this feature. The downside: I wish there was a way to control music from this device to other devices that are Bluetooth enabled. The best thing about this Bluetooth device is that it's very portable. If you don't have one of those "portable" Bluetooth speakers, you can simply leave your computer or phone at home, and the device will automatically connect with your wireless network when it's on your network.   What I don't like: It's not waterproof. If there was any other way to have my music while the Bluetooth device was inside the water, I would have ordered it! The Bluetooth connection sometimes won't work. It sometimes takes two tries to connect. I don a USB adapter for this device, which is nice. I wish this Bluetooth connection could also be used with my Android smartphone, as I prefer to control my music with my phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     5 out of 5 Amazing! Love it! Works wonderfully. Love the feel of it. And the sound, and the looks. The only thing is that it is so heavy. And, you need a really big battery to charge. But, it is worth every penny.  4 out of the 5   I was expecting a little more sound when playing guitar. But overall, it seems like a great little keyboard for me. I can't wait for an app that will let me plug this keyboard in to my PC and use it as an instrument, and maybe a synthesizer at some point. ,  2 out of 6   It takes a long time to charge, but with a bit of patience, the keyboard is a great sounding instrument. It also works as a virtual keyboard, but the keyboard itself is not very responsive. I am not a piano player and I use a keyboard, so the lack of response may be a deal breaker. It's great for finger style writing, but it's a little heavy for my liking. I also wish it came in a more affordable model.  have used this keyboard for years now. it has performed consistently and it is great sounding but the price is a little steep. I can't recommend it if you are on a budget  1 out of 1 found this review helpful For what it is I think it is a fine keyboard. Unfortunately, for the price, I was hoping for a lot more than what I got. It has all the features you would want and it has the features that I would use on a regular basis. I don't play a lot of traditional instruments, but this does have a good set of keystrokes and a good volume knob. . It is not a very easy keyboard for beginners. To get it to do what it says it will do you'll have to get up close to it, but once you get it working you'll find a real treasure. - Steve
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item has failed to meet the standard I expect in my electronic devices.   At $200, it is well worth the money.   Rated 1 out of 5 by kiran from very poor design The charger itself is a little hard to plug in so I had to get a second usb connector to put on the back of my laptop. I was worried that the charger itself would work because I was using it in a very high-end computer and there is a clear plastic case around it. However the charging cable that comes with it to connect it to a computer doesn't fit on my motherboard. The USB connector has a sharp protruding tip which makes it very difficult to plug it in the back. I used the laptop cable that came with it and it still has a problem as there is only 2 holes for the USB connection. The charging cable also doesn't have enough length. It is too short for the charger to fit it under the keyboard. I would never recommend this to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because I wanted a smart watch that wasn't bulky and didn't use battery power. The design and interface is very nice. I like that you can display notifications for emails, tweets, texts, emails, phone calls, and calls. However, the display is very dim and doesn't show notifications when I'm watching TV, surfing the web, or reading. If I had known this before purchasing, I would have bought an Apple Watch or a Fitbit. I don't recommend this as a daily watch for the money. The watch will only show notifications that you have set as favorites. It's more of a novelty to have a watch that tells the time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main problem with this camera is that the images are very noisy. The images are just as good as the cameras I've reviewed above with slightly less noise, but not a huge amount less. The colors are good, and I think that I was getting more clarity at the high ISO settings than I was in the lower ones, which is just fine. But the noise level is very high, which means you are going to need to use manual controls, and this is especially true of the color histograms. As far as the image quality goes, it's probably not bad. But if I had to give it a bad review, I'd say it's too noisy for my taste.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Chris L. from Excellent Compact Camera For the money, this is a great camera. I bought a used one in 2004 and it lasted about 4 years until I decided to take a chance and buy a used version. I found it to be extremely reliable and the images were great, until I bought my second one about a year and half ago, at which time the shutter had stopped working. Luckily, I just swapped it out for a newer model and am just as happy with the images. You can certainly get more noise at the highest settings (as I noted in the review of the earlier model), but I prefer the more neutral tones. For the price, I'll keep using it. - Chris L

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These things are too big and heavy. It's like being in a car that was built in the 80's and still running and using a manual transmission. I am a 5'1" girl and this will take up too much of my shoulders. The cable is not that thick, so it will scratch my sensitive skin. I will not recommend this product to anyone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not only works but looks great I wanted a new Bluetooth headphone but was disappointed that I couldn't buy the latest in wireless technology, Bluetooth, from Radio Shack because I would not be able to use it with my iPhone 3G. This is my second pair of these headphones. The first pair were a little loose in my car (they fit perfectly, but there is no way you will get them to stay on your head). I bought a different Bluetooth headset, and have had nothing but great experiences. I like the feel of them, they look good, and I'm going to use them in my studio and at home. I've even been using them to listen to podcasts.    This is a great pair for recording vocals, acoustic guitar, etc... and they do not hurt my ears at all.  the Bluetooth range is wide enough to not have to worry about the cables getting in the way of other audio/video devices. This may or may not work well with other apps but is fine for audio apps. This product may take up more of your space than you are used to with other models but you will need to find a small box to place your headset in so you don't have to buy more cables.   The speakers are very good. I'm a bit of an audio geek and when I was using my old speakers that have been replaced with this product, I was blown away with how loud these were. The headphones are pretty light and have a solid feel.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's cheap and useless. I had to pay $25 for a replacement screen when it finally broke, and then there were no buttons on the screen at all. It doesn't work well with other computer systems, and I was using it as an external hard drive. I have the laptop version and it didn't work, either.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Can't buy, can't use I bought this to use with a new iMac with 4GB RAM and 500G HD. But the screen had to be replaced due to the poor screen resolution and other problems. I didn't like the screen resolution at all as it looks like it was made for the old Apple IIe or even the Commodore 64. I'm really disappointed in the quality. I will definitely not be purchasing any of these products.  (Posted on 6/16/2017)  Not very useful I bought a couple of these and now I don't know if I'm going to use them. I was hoping that the memory would allow me to edit the files I want to edit. I never have a lot of money so this would be a good solution to some editing problems. The screen resolution is too low for my needs. I know some people are saying the size is too big. I don 't need that. The memory size is also too small. I bought 2 at the same time so the memory was already at its lowest level. The only thing I liked about the device is the weight of the unit. When you first get it, it is not very big. The device just fits in your hand which is nice. I really wish I didn 't get it. The worst part of this unit was how bad the screen quality was. I can 't see the file icons that I need to edit anything on. I am a very low-end PC user and I do a lot more than edit files. I do word processors, CAD packages, graphics, web site development, etc. and the quality is really poor. You might not think so but the device does not work well when editing files. It's better than just putting the device on the workbench but it just doesn't offer the quality you would expect from a $15-20 device. Priced right. You get what you pay for. Not very good screen resolution for what you get. But still very good price for what it is. (Posted in June

It is not really bad for the price, and the microphone is quite good. I also have a Sony headset that is way worse quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When it's not working as expected (e.g., the buttons aren't working on your device, you can't connect the device to your computer via USB, etc.) I'll usually give it 1 star. If there is some reason for the good to outweigh the bad, I'll give it 2. I think it's important to find a good deal, especially if you are looking for a used one.  Not so much a "pro" as just a cool device: I bought this to use with my Xbox 360 and for a few weeks it worked, until the "off" key went on and on and then it wouldn't shut down. I sent it back and I got it back the same day. I was able to send it back to Walmart and get a refund and now I have to decide whether to buy it again. I got the "buy it now" option as well, but I really didn't want to have to go through the hassle of buying the device again and sending it back if it wouldn it fit with the 360.  of this product was it? This is a great product that has the potential to become part of my life. This is the first piece of gear I own that is connected to my television. If I need to play video games, I'm good to go. This has already made a big impression on my friends and family that have already seen it in action. If it doesn't work out, I've had a good experience and I feel the price was a good value.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â The batteries in these batteries were almost dead. I don't know if the packaging was bad or if they didn't last long.

This unit should be more like the first generation of this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - You should know that if you don't like an electronic device, then you don?t like it for what it is:  - It can be easy to get excited over your new electronic device - It makes things too easy:  Â  - It's too easy to make mistakes, especially if you?re not used to it   The original title of this article was "Why a negative attitude about electronic gadgets is a good idea". However, a lot of people complained about this title and I realized I had been too critical. I apologize to anyone who feels I?ve hurt their feelings. However, I still think the title is too negative. Maybe the word?-y? could have been more effective. Anyway, I think there are two main reasons for using a negative approach. The first is simple:  A negative approach is the quickest and most efficient way to do a review of something.  It usually gets the review out much faster and, as a bonus, doesn't waste your time writing about stuff you don t like.  This review will be very brief (although I have been told that it can be a little longer if you really want it to be). I have spent an entire weekend reading through my old books in preparation for this review. It has been a few days now since I began reading, and I have only come to the last few chapters. I know I should have been reading it sooner, but the first few chapters took a while to get through. So, let?s move on.   The first reason for using the negative approach to reviews is that it allows you to write about something you really don? t like much more effectively than you would with a positive approach. I mean, who does a review like this? Â Someone who knows it well enough to make sense of it and give a solid, concise explanation of why he/she thinks the product is or is not a good choice for someone. Â In other words, a person with a strong understanding of his/her own product.  I am glad that my previous review of my iPod was a success.  But, that is the reason why I am writing this review today. I have discovered a weakness in my iPod.  In other words:  A weakness in how I think about my iPod that I didn?t have before I read this article. And it is bad.  This weakness has been causing me to write negative reviews
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really hoping that the new iPad would be better. It's the thinnest I've owned. And it has a faster processor, so you can use it all the time. But I am pretty disappointed. I've tried it with the music apps, the news apps, Google Maps, Google Play music, Netflix, and Amazon Instant Video. The first thing that I saw when I turned on the iPad was that the keyboard would vibrate after every word. That's annoying, but then it starts to make a buzzing noise every time I try to type in a search. I have been trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong and I've been going back to my old iPhone 5. I'd rate it lower because the audio quality isn't as good, but it's really nice to be able to check messages and make calls. It would be even nicer to have the fingerprint reader on the back so that it's easier to use. But if you're trying to use the tablet as a music player it's too noisy for me.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought my first iPad a couple years ago, I was quite impressed with how great the display is on the new iPad. However, it is far from the best I've ever seen. If you are considering purchasing an iPad, I would recommend using a keyboard. There are some keyboards on the market that are much better than the iPad's. However I did not want to go with a $99 keyboard, so I bought a third-party keyboard. This is definitely not a tablet, it's a $499 "tablet" with no keyboard.    I'm not sure how this particular keyboard differs from a regular iPad's keyboard. The key caps aren't very large or even flat, making it difficult to type without looking at the screen. I tried some "on the go" typing and I couldn't type for more than a couple sentences without looking down at the keyboard. With a keyboard like this, I can only imagine how much faster it would be on a normal keyboard. I do not regret my purchase and would certainly buy it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product because of the reviews, but the product I received was not what it claimed it would be. I am very disappointed in this product. I have been using it for several days now, and it does not work well. If you have problems with it, it is very likely your power source (wall w/ AC or battery) is not strong enough, and/or you did not take care of it properly. There are other inexpensive "wall wirs" on the market with no problems, so there is no reason to buy this one.

When the new laptop came out, I was super excited to finally be able to use my old machine for my writing and programming. But the whole thing just wasn't worth the money. So I tried a few other laptops but my experience with any of them have been pretty bad (or good). I was happy to see a new laptop come out from ASUS recently with a nice design.   Then the new Asus Transformer Book T100 came out and it's awesome! It's a bit bigger than my old Lenovo Yoga, but it's still small enough that it fits nicely in my bag without my needing to take the cover off (although the lid doesn't come off). The keyboard is quite nice (maybe even better than my last one), the trackpad is very responsive, the screen is awesome, and the battery lasts all day (though it only has about 10 hours). I'm so excited about this laptop and can't wait to get it with a couple of days of use. I don't know if it's the keyboard, the track pad, or the screen, but I've only had a few moments of lag or choppiness with it, and it only seems to show up if I'm using the touchpad or keyboard. The only downside is that it only comes in one color, but if it wasn't for that I wouldn't have bought this new laptop.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really like the feel of the device and it has been the most useful thing I've owned. However, the battery life of the tablet is absolutely terrible. I went from 3 days of regular use to 15 minutes the first week of using the tablet and it's been going downhill since. There's no way I can get a 2nd week from that kind of usage. The thing will die almost instantly in less than an hour of normal usage. Also, the keyboard is awful. It's too cramped to comfortably type on and the click sound is way too loud. All in all I wouldn't recommend this device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      I bought this product a few months ago. I bought it for the purpose of taking pictures with my Sony A7II. I took a few test shots in different lighting, and I was a bit disappointed when the camera would not capture any sharpness. It did capture fine text, but it was a real struggle to make out text in photos with the camera's auto focus. I am not sure if this was a software issue with the phone or the camera.  If I could have done without the auto focus, I would have probably picked up a cheap flip phone. The manual focus is extremely easy to do with any DSLR lens and it's nice having a manual lens and having something manual can actually be done.  and I did like the camera more for my needs. .    A few problems:  (1)   (2)  (3)       (1):    My camera had a bad capacitor. I replaced it. No big deal. It's not the end of the world. I've seen worse cameras with bad capacitors on the A7 series. It was not a problem.    (and no, the capacitor did not cause the battery drain I noticed in some shots)    ( 2):    (3):  (4):  And no, I did not use a different battery or charge port.   Overall:   A good camera. I'd give it a 7.5. (1): (2):  I'm very impressed with the AF. I have a Canon 70D, and for the most part the focusing is spot on. The auto focus is much quicker to set, and the focus is fast and accurate, though you can't zoom with it on a full frame body. It does not zoom at all. With the lens cap on, the camera is a little heavy, though not bad. It isn't as bright as my D700, but the images are bright, crisp, and contrasty. It doesn't capture shadows as well as the D70 does, but I think the lens has more correction for this than the D700 has. I do not know what the sensor is doing though, because it only captures JPEGs. No RAW files or anything. It should capture RAW if the firmware is changed and allows it to. And if so, you'll need to download the manual. I'm
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You can't believe how many people are saying that the EOSMOS is a great camera, but they just can't get the images that they are looking for. You will see a lot of posts like this one.   A few years ago I owned one of these cameras. It was my first foray into digital photography. I just love the fact that my pictures come out so crisp and clear. However, there are plenty of comments on this forum from people who own EOS-MOS cameras, and their pictures are better than the one's that are posted here. Maybe if they had more experience in photography they would know better.  The EOS 7D is a fantastic camera, if not one of the best cameras on the market, and it is probably one of my most used cameras. The best thing about the 7D camera is that it is quite affordable for the amount of features you get.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The batteries are low capacity - they don't last very long.   For $350+ you could buy 4 or 5 3200 mAh batteries and have more battery life.  So they charge very slowly, I usually have to wait 45 minutes until they charge to full.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A year ago, I bought the Sony XBR-X900D for my daughter. She started with it and loved it. She then got a new laptop and I gave her the XBR. She still has the X900D because of the new battery but the X940D is way easier to use. It has the most advanced features that I like the most.   This is my 2nd Sony device.  Sony has become the best manufacturer of electronics I have ever purchased. I think I have been with them my whole life!   Posted by David Z at 7:13 AM

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      1.)   To be blunt:  When I first purchased this product, I was excited, but quickly became disappointed.    I was expecting this phone to be better than my AT&T and T-mobile phones, as it had better features.  .  The screen seemed more vibrant, and I thought the front-facing camera and front- facing microphone would be more accurate than on my AT & T phones.  I bought this phone because I didn't like my old Droid phone at all.  This phone is far from a bad product.  It's a great addition to a growing list of gadgets I have.  However, I would never recommend this product to anyone.  2.)  It has a few annoying features:  I find it really hard to make and receive calls.  Because it has a dedicated voicemail, I have to dial the number into the phone.  That isn't hard to do for me.  For anyone else, the phone could be set up to auto-answer.  3.)  The back is a bit flimsy, so don't expect it to last long.  Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about it.  4.)  A "free" extra feature that doesn't seem to work is the speakerphone.  With this feature, you can use your phone as a headset, so you can listen to music while you chat on a phone call.  5.)  I wish this was a cheaper device, as my AT and T cell phones are much more expensive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   You know, I've read some things about how many new and shiny gadgets we have these days, but the one thing that you never hear of is the time it takes to return your old phone or tablet. Well, I guess we should thank our lucky stars that my HTC One (M8) has an excellent 8 year warranty.  Â I'm very pleased with my purchase, and have used the phone for over 3 years without any major issues.  I have an S4, and I can't believe the difference between my two phones!    One thing to note is that this device is very quiet, I haven't found any of the fan noise to be very distracting to my work.  If you are not going to purchase a HTC device, it is best to go with the Google Nexus 5.  Now if you were wondering about the price of the HTC One, well that is $100 cheaper than the Nexus 5 which starts at $399.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had an electronic device failure the first time I used the unit, but the unit had been properly maintained and used within the past month (and no other problems in that period, by the way). This time I was very disappointed. I'm a fan of electronic devices, I just want the best quality. The unit doesn't meet that standard. The power cord is very cheaply made, it's like the cord has no strength at all. It's not a problem, but it's not something I can live with. I don't understand why there's no protection against such a design flaw.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A couple years ago, I got my first computer. I wanted one for gaming, but I didn't want to get a $900 "gaming machine" with an ATI card.   When I got the computer, I was impressed with the sound, speed, size, graphics capabilities, and many other good things.  My only disappointment was that the keyboard was made by a cheap Chinese company called Foxconn, which made cheap crap like the Lenovo keyboard I have. It has not improved in terms of key quality, but at least it was better than the cheap Chinese keyboard.  However, when I first used the computer to play computer games, I did have some problems. I had some problems with sound, too. When I turned on the computer and I got a very loud hum and it seemed to pick up the noises from the computer speakers when I spoke, that bothered me. It also picked up the sound of the computer screen when I tried to open my Word doc.  I thought about it for a little while, and I decided that I could fix it by using a piece of masking tape over the top of the keyboard, making it quieter. So I put some masking tapes over the keyboard of the laptop and it is so much quieter now.  Also, I found that some keyboards are more prone to overheating than others. For example, my Dell keyboard (with Windows 8 pre-installed) did not heat up, but my Acer keyboard did. I thought that maybe I wasn't doing something right, but when I took the keyboards to a hardware repair shop, they found that the Dell keyboard was a bad keyboard that overheated. So you should be aware of your keyboard, and just replace the keyboard if it gets too hot.  Conclusion:  This is a good laptop for the price. The sound issues, keyboard issues, and poor quality display is not worth the money, but if you don't mind the price, this laptop is a great choice.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I was looking at an old computer mouse on ebay for $15 and found this one for about $10 more and it's much better!   I've been using this mouse for two weeks now and it works just fine for me.   It's also a little lighter so it doesn't cause the back of my hands to ache after a while.  When I first got it I thought it had a defective wire that caused it to buzz/make noises. I replaced it, but when I went to take it back to the store to exchange it the guy said "that's just a different mouse" (he had the same one) so I left it and bought a different brand mouse from another store.  Now I have 2 of these and the other is still in its box.  You won't find a better mouse for the money out there!  I'm using this with my old laptop and it is much more stable than the mouse on my laptop.  My laptop won't get it's cursor to the right part of the screen without this mouse.  The only thing I wish was that I could adjust the sensitivity in the mouse (it's pretty darn sensitive).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - the usb charger has an annoying clicking sound - the screen is not easily readable - the speakers have a harsh buzzing noise (on my unit, but maybe you have an amp or stereo) - the batteries have a short lifespan, a few times I had to change them. - the button to turn on/off is awkward and requires several button presses for the phone to power up. Overall, if you want to have your phone charge quickly, this is a decent charger. I did enjoy my first run.  - I like the fact that I have it in my pocket. It is a nice piece of art. The design is very unique. -   It is not as powerful as other chargers I have had. - The battery will run for a bit and then go dead. - -
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was a great piece of kit for an inexpensive unit. I got it on a sale a few months ago and was very pleased with the performance and ease of installation. The build quality is not stellar but is a little better than I expected. The included stand is not a bad idea but it is a bit weak. The controls are intuitive and easy to use and once you get the hang of them, the unit is very good. The only thing I don't like is that when you change batteries, you have to hold down the power button as it is very hard to move the unit when it is in sleep mode. This was not a problem for me though because I can leave the unit in sleep as long as I hold down that power button.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      No good at all! I used to own two of these, one in the UK (I was born in England) and one in my old home in California. They both work fine for most of the time but after a while they get very hot to the touch, especially when the screen heats up. And when the phone is warm to the hand or a certain way, they are noisy. The phone is fine when the battery is charging (which is the case most of time when you first start the phone up), but when it is done and the battery comes on, the fan noise is constant. The fan sounds like it is at full speed and it gets louder. And the phone gets warm to your hand when it has been working for a while! And in my opinion, this is not a quality product.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you are looking for a very expensive phone you are in the right place! This phone has some serious issues that are quite a bit beyond me.   It is very slow to respond and it makes calls VERY slow.  The battery life is not very long and it doesn't even last a day of use (which is good). The camera is horrible, and the video quality is worse than some low quality phones I have.  There are other reviews saying the screen is not a touch, so I did not see this, but that was not true, as my wife used to be able to read the time to me in the night on my night stand.  I was really hoping for a better screen quality because I bought this because of the price, but I am really disappointed in this phone.  Rated 2 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good enough for a lot of people but don't expect any miracles I bought one to replace my old s5c, this phone is pretty good for the price and all, but it has some pretty major issues. The phone doesn't have LTE so calling is pretty slow if you use data on wifi, but when the wifi isn't on it is okay, but the phone can go from 1% to 30% in 5 minutes because it takes too long to get into settings. The camera does a good job, it takes really good pics but is still a bit of a disappointment when you see the low end of the image. If you do not expect miracles then this is the phone for you. You won't be disappointed, it is still good for a low price, just not as great as you expected  I was excited to receive my phone a few weeks ago. It was packaged very well. The packaging was good and the product was as I expected. Once it arrived, it was just a bit too light. I had used an external battery to charge the phone in a hotel. The USB charging port was broken, but was replaced by my hotel service. This problem was corrected promptly. I have used this phone for a few months now, and have experienced issues with this phone at first. These problems began with the phone turning off randomly, when it was plugged into a charger, and later when charging via USB. Other issues include a lack of battery backup (the phone can get very hot) and a weak voice recognition feature. The poor voice recognition means I have to be careful when talking on the phone. Also
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     "The iPod is a huge disappointment. Not to mention a giant pain in the butt to install.  It has to be my favorite piece of junk I've ever used. The batteries are a joke and the controls have no feedback whatsoever. When the "back up" button isn't even working you know your device is broken or defective. , it's time to replace it, as this product is a total nightmare in the making. I was so excited about getting one of these babies for my daughter as she's learning to read and she's been having a hard time keeping up with her homework. I couldn't be happier. Well, a week later it's back on the shelves, but no longer a good choice for my little one!  The first time I got it I plugged it in and the speaker was very quiet, then the next time it went into standby mode and then stopped. That wasn't right! Then the next day the speakers went into auto-sleep mode. When I checked the volume the next morning it was much louder! I didn't even want to hear the speaker, but the battery's on full! When you plug it in, the screen goes blank, so you have to press the sleep button just to turn it back on.    The audio quality is terrible. The iPod has always had sound that wasn't bad, but this one is so crappy. I can't wait for Apple to come out with the new iPod shuffle. I'm guessing that this will be the new low-res iPod. ... and it is just that bad. If you like to listen to music or play your videos while you go about your day or do something else that requires a high quality sound, you should look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first purchased my iPhone 4S on April 29, 2011, the phone arrived promptly and in good working order. However, the software that would make my phone work with any of the 3G-capable carrier network (HTC, Sprint, AT&T) was nowhere to be found, and I had to rely on the 3rd party software that Apple had installed on my computer to work on my iPhone. It seemed that my phone was only available for the Sprint plan at a few stores where my credit card information was used, and the rest of the places were off limits, but one day, I was using the phone and I remembered that my 3G plans were no longer available on my carrier. Since I had paid for my iPhone, I wanted it to work with the carrier that I had chosen. I used my credit or debit card to buy the 3GB data plan, which I could use on AT& T, Sprint or Verizon. I got my phone, and it didn't work. I called AT& t hrough the voicemail, and AT&t's customer service representative told me that "we don't have 3G" and I could go buy a new iPhone. I asked him if there were any options for a new phone, but he had no response.   I have to say that I don't understand why AT&TC doesn't offer 3G service to anyone else. The phone works well on my AT&TT phone line, so I can use it with any carrier I want. However AT&TFS doesn't seem to offer the ability to use my phone as a data phone. I have tried to use it on T-mobile, but T-Mobile's website shows the "3G/LTE only" data plan. I haven't used it, so perhaps there is an option, but I don`t know.  I had bought this phone because I wanted a mobile phone that would work with my 3 G-capitable carriers, and for that reason I needed to be able to use any data plan that I chose, and at least AT&HTs website should have told me I couldn't do that with the AT&Co 3G phones. I would really like to see AT&C's 3G/Wifi technology spread to all of their mobile phone lines, and not only be limited to the carrier of my choice.  Thanks, Mark F.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was hoping that the new iPod nano would work well for listening to my music in the car, but it has been completely unacceptable.   My first thought when I saw the tiny MP3 player inside the mini is, wow, a mini music player. I don't like the mini as much as I do the full sized MP3 players, but the mini player is a nightmare. I've had to listen to it for two days and still can't get it to work. The problem seems to be related to the iPod itself. After the install, there's a tiny little chip that is supposed to communicate with the microUSB connector on the iPod nano. It just won't connect. I had to send the iPod back. I got one that had a problem with the battery charger and a defective connector, but no other problems.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Great product, but can't access the phone settings when on a call or wifi.  This is a very nice product. I can't comment much on the usability of the app or the hardware itself (not yet), but the battery life is very nice. The problem is that I cannot get the phone to set the wifi password. I'm on LTE, but when I try to access the settings I can only access the password setting. The phone is running on Android 2.2, but the wifi settings are not set. 's main feature is that you can customize your phone's colors (light, dark and accent colors) and you can change the icons, and you will be able to send texts, but there are also plenty of settings in the app to change the sound, music, and screen rotation. The main disadvantage is that when the phone is off the screen gets hot very easily and the screen brightness is also pretty low. If you don't like those things I'm not sure if you should buy it or not.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this from another company and I have the same problems. I get the sound out of this one even though I have a good sound card and drivers. The USB port is useless. I have to use my computer to connect to the phone line and my phone's sound will not come out of the phone and will not connect to my computer. I bought a used one at RadioShack that had the USB port. That is what I should have gotten, but again, I was looking for the cheapest and the best that I could find.    Rated 5 out of 5 by James S. from I purchased a new one because I was getting tired of plugging... I purchased an older model and was having the same problem with my sound card. But I decided to get a new and upgraded model. This device worked great. The unit is easy to use, works great, and is very sturdy.  It works just as it is described  Great product, great price!  It's a good device and I was able to do voice-over with my cell phone over my home-made microphone. Thanks for a great device.  I needed to buy this to be able to take phone calls with a car radio. Great idea. I like how easy to take the call. The only thing is that sometimes the call goes to an on-off, it's hard to tell, but I don't know why but I could hear them talking during the break.

This battery lasts about one day.

The software is good, if a little over-complicated. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem:  When you receive the phone, it appears the case is a little scratchy and has a few small dents on it.  Then it is all over the place on the phone and the bottom.    It seems like it will not hold any charge at all even with my custom battery.  (I don't know if it has the exact same issue that I've found with every other battery that I buy, so that may not be the case.)   My recommendation:  I did a lot of research and chose this phone over the iPhone 5S for several reasons. I was very excited about the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus but I was disappointed in the performance of both phones. I'm not sure I could live with the iPhone 7 Plus either.  They all had a flaw with the software that made them unusable.  I was on the fence about the 7 Plus because of the 4k display, but the display on this phone was great. I just feel like this was a great way to get into the iPhone and was willing to trade it in for a decent phone.  This is the second Apple product that I have received that I didn't like.  The first was my Mac Mini 2.2ghz Intel CPU when I first got it but it was a good computer and it did a very good job with most of what I needed.  Â  I just wish the new models would be even better and have a few more features. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm using this thing as a wireless keyboard for my iPad Pro. It works great as a keyboard, but when I turn on the iPad Pro, the keyboard doesn't recognize the iPad, and the iPad won't recognize it. So the iPad doesn't go through this entire cycle of rebooting and using the keyboard. In fact, it takes so long, the iPad shuts off and I can't get it back on. I've already replaced the keyboard and the new iPad is working perfectly. Also, the key switches have a nice click sound when the keys are depressed and the keys don't feel cheap when you type on them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received my iPhone 5 today. I am not sure if it is defective or if Apple has just sent a bad unit. I can not use it at all. I tried to call to Apple support but no one answered my call. So I took a picture of my screen and put it in the forum under the question about iPhone 5. You can see the difference between the screen. When I tried using the iPhone 5 I had a lot of trouble using it. There is no power button, just a few buttons that look very old and used, but do nothing. Then when you try to call and make a call you will get a message that the call is busy. So you have to use the home button to start a call. There are no instructions or anything else on how to use it. So it is like you have no clue how to even use a new iPhone 5 device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I received the watch as a replacement for a friend of mine who recently lost his wristwatch. I am extremely happy with the purchase and I would definitely recommend to any one looking for a good looking watch. I love the retro look and the battery life is great. Only thing I don't love is how thick the case is and the band doesn't stay on properly. If the band could be slightly thicker it would be perfect. I can get used to it in a couple of weeks but then I will have to go back and get a new one and replace this one. I also would recommend buying a leather band as well to make it even more comfortable. It is great when I am running and don't want to worry about my wrist getting wet.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad device cannot be a substitute for a good one. I have a pair of "scofflaws" that are extremely loud. They also seem to be getting worse and worse. The cord that the speakers attach to is almost as bad as the speaker. The speakers are loud enough to get by the window on my car's dashboard, yet it would be an enormous help if they had a cord that I could plug in to the back of my stereo. If you are looking for a pair for stereo or just a music device they should be easy to come by.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The SDC2-10 is a solid little speaker that doesn't blow hot air out of it when I want it. It has a nice balance, and has a good volume level. It's not the brightest, nor does it have the most volume, but for a 10" speaker this isn't a problem. It does sound a little quiet, however, and sounds a little bit too "dry" for my taste.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because it was a bit on the high end of the "luxury" category for my $500-600+ smartphone. I do not use my smartphone for "phone calls" at all, even with my $5/month unlimited data plan. This device is a complete failure, and the screen was terrible when I opened the box. The screen came up just a little bit too far. I bought the black version, which was actually a better quality screen than the gold version, but I think the gold had more color saturation, even though I did buy the black one (because I'm a blackberry fan!). The buttons on this device were horrible: the back, home, and side buttons were all bad. The middle, which I use for volume up and down, was really too mushy for my liking. I will not use this device again, and I don't recommend it.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, July 07, 2010  Best phone on the market.  the best!  by Richard from Lakeland FL USA  Review: This was the second time I bought it. I've had a couple of other phones over the years, and they're pretty poor quality. This one has a beautiful screen and is just great. My only complaint is that the phone battery dies after a few weeks of regular use and I have to buy a new one. That's about it!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a cheap computer for $200 off of a coupon.  It didn't work right out of the box, so I bought an extra USB cable. When the computer is not powered on, it is hard to see or touch anything. It is not a replacement for the desktop.   Overall, a good computer with great storage, but not worth the price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    " I ordered this at the end of last year and I was really excited for this. The product was exactly as advertised, I was extremely happy to use it for my daughter, I had to turn off the bluetooth and it still worked. It also had the best battery life ever, it lasted me a week and a half and I only used it on my nightstand. It was nice to not have to turn on my house. The app was a little buggy but I expected that. Also, the sound was loud enough for my small room, it is louder than my old night stand. However, I still need to figure out how to set the screen brightness and also the ability to turn it on and off. That is a feature I have found lacking, it does not have a battery light. Finally, I noticed the light from my night stand does not stay on all night. This product is great! "
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this product last year as a replacement for a failed device. I bought this because I have a bad back and wanted to use my laptop at work as I had only the laptop at home. I thought the device would work well because I read that other users had problems with it. The main problem I had was the power adapter would not turn on after 5 minutes of constant use. It would get up to 70-80% then shut off. I took it back to my home office, and they were kind enough to send a replacement unit that turned on immediately. I had the worst experience with my purchase because of the slow charging power. I now understand why the other users were having problems. The battery life on this product is not great, even if you do not use it for long periods of time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These are not really meant for the public and should only be used by the experts who can really take a good picture with them.   You really cannot use them for general purpose purposes and you should only use them in a lab where you can get great pictures.  Rated 5 out of 5 by D. A. D. from Great value, good quality I have been using this product for a while and have found it to be just fine for the price. The pictures are clear and crisp. My only issue is that it is hard to get a tight seal on the bottom. The edges are not very tight, so I do use a screwdriver or pry bar to help me with that. I will continue to use this product and recommend it.  Rated 3 out of five by Anonymous from Good product with some flaws The pictures provided by B&H are quite clear and easy to see in the darkroom, however, the negatives of this camera were a few. First, the camera seems to be well made. The housing and buttons are all metal, and the camera is lightweight. The images produced by the camera were very clear, however it would be nice if the pictures were a little sharper as the colors are not quite as vivid. Second, the battery does not last long. It has a 5-minute battery life, but I noticed my batteries would only last an hour or so. I think the battery life will vary based on how you set the camera up and your shooting style, but overall the quality is good, if not excellent.    Rated 4 out of the 5 by M. E. from Good value I purchased this camera after some searching. It is a little different than the previous models in a couple of ways. I purchased the XL. The size of the XL is not quite what I expected, but it is very good for the money. The design is also a different one. The plastic is a good quality, and it is not the light weight plastic I have come to expect from Nikon cameras. This camera does not have the zoom. It seems to have a fixed focal length that ranges from 50mm to 300mm. It also doesn't have a hot shoe. The lens and mirror are very good, and I'm very happy with the design. This is the way to go for anyone on a budget.   B&H photo has excellent service. This was my first time buying from B&h, and with

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When it came in, it was a little scratchy and a little noisy.   The battery was very weak.  It took three times longer than I would have preferred.  Very disappointed.   Rated 1 out of 5 by A reader from Poor quality and horrible product I bought this about a month ago and have already returned it. First off, the device is extremely thin. It seems like it could be made thinner if they used a larger LCD screen. Also, the design of the device leaves a lot to be desired. It's hard to grip the device because the entire top and sides are covered in plastic. It has a poor battery life and can't keep the screen lit. I also had a problem with this item.  The "tape" that came with the device was not taped properly.  I tried to install the battery on it but the plastic would not go in smoothly.  Customer Review 5/20/2016 3:33:49 PMVerified Overall Product Rating:  I bought this product for my son, who has a learning disability. I have used the device at least 2-3 times and it is by far the best tool that he has ever had. My son has learned new words in a short period of time and we are able to communicate at a much higher level. The product is not just good for learning new words; it's great for communicating with your parents and teachers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is a very nice and well made device. The only downside is that the power switch on the front of the device is a bit of a pain to press. However, I've used many different electronic devices that had a similar switch. I bought this device on a mission to improve my audio. I can hear every bit of detail and articulation in the recording. I have a good pair of headphones that I use to listen to music, so it was a bit disappointing to not be able to hear the difference between the highs and lows and the mids, just as I can in a good set of headphones. I would highly recommend this device to anyone who needs to improve their audio recording.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you can't tell from the above video that I love my HTC 10 and the One M9's camera, I am not going to explain it to you. I love them both and will be using them very often. The HTC 10 has the better camera and will take good photos on almost anything with good lighting and decent lighting. It is not going as far as the M9 in low light photos but in good lighting photos you can see all the details in the details on the HTC 10. The M9 has the best camera for low light so I just bought a M9. I don't really have a strong preference either way so I think I'm going to use them both. I hope that helps.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I think this is a fantastic gadget but i have had to return a couple of these because they are not working and they are still under warranty so its worth the money to return them  I have been using the iDroid for 3 months and I am very impressed. I used the iPad to access my music. iDoid can sync with my iPad and play music. I can listen to music on my phone, or my TV and my ipad will sync to it. I am also able to have the music play as i move from my phone to my ipads and my phone sync back to my iPad. This is the first device that can do what I want it to. I have had the ipad since early 2009 and the iPhone 5 is coming out soon but it has been a long time. I would like to see a device like this come out soon so that I can keep up with my phone and ipad.  The iPhone and IDroid are very similar. They can be connected to each other by a micro USB cable. The iPad is a different story. It has an external hard drive that is not included in the iFone, and cannot be synced via the iNOD. This does not mean that the iPhone is inferior to the I-Phone, as long as you want to connect it to a computer.  a small-screen tablet that comes with an external memory for photos, documents and music. With a large memory capacity and wireless-connectivity, the i-Droid is an ideal companion for your mobile devices and smart devices. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15 Next  Last  Add your review by logging in or signing up

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I got the e5-150k for my father in law. He got the first one when it was first introduced. It is pretty nice. Very simple design. The keypad is good for someone with little or no experience in using computers. I think the computer is also pretty good and I would recommend it. It has all of the basic things that anyone needs.   When the batteries die and the computer gets hard to use it will be pretty hard to find a new one.  My father in Law has had the e3-150 since the 80s and he is an avid computer user.  The e5 is just a little less than the e1 and e3 at this point.  I love the case, the screen is beautiful, and the keyboard. I use the computer on a tablet when I am away from the computer and this is the most convenient way to have the computer ready to go when I get home. I like the keyboard and mouse, and have had no issues with it so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If your E-PAD has some trouble with syncing to your phone, this will be the most aggravating thing to happen to you.   When I bought this the first time it was a gift for my wife and I both loved it so much, we were happy to receive it for Christmas.  It synced fine, but when she went to use it the next day it was all messed up. The screen had been messed up, her fingers were all jittery, it was not responding to any buttons, it wasn't blinking.  I didn't think much of it, I had gotten used to it and just ignored it.  However I decided to test it out myself.  If my phone was turned on with no data, I could not turn the E-pad on.  After a lot of troubleshooting, I learned that it would NOT work when the phone is on. I was really confused because I tried the same thing with my computer and it worked fine.  This is the first thing I bought when I did not know what I was getting. The price was excellent, the service was very fast and I was able to use this with my wife's phone.  The only negative I can think of is this unit would have been much better if it didn't have the issue of being all messed-up when it came to syncing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The main problem I had with my eletronic guitar is that it's pretty loud. When I'm singing along to a song, I need to hear some bass (because when I'm on the guitar I'm not singing along), but the noise from the Eletronic is pretty much the same as the bass playing on a acoustic. For the price of this eletric guitar it is the best thing to buy in the electronic category. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the most poorly made, unreliable, expensive, loud, bulky, clunky, confusing, loud and annoying thing I have ever owned.   It has worked flawlessly with one other device.  This should have been the one to give up on a couple years ago.  The battery life is pathetic, the display is terrible, the sound is very loud (I'm a rock fan) and the size of the device is a joke.  It's a pain to set up and use in the garage.  I don't even understand why I put up with all of the issues.  After two years of using the iPod nano 4 GB with its battery life, I have had enough.  If you want a nice digital music player that has a larger screen, a nicer sound, a decent battery life and is easy to set-up and use, look elsewhere.   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "I've used this for about a year now. It's the worst I've ever felt on an electronic device. I'm so glad I gave it back. It was really a hassle to deal with all the paperwork and the return process. I was very unhappy with this product."  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good little portable digital camera Bought this to use in the field, it has a 5.0 inch screen, and comes with a decent camera bag. Very durable and I have not had it fail on me in a day or two. I use it as a photojournalist and don't really use it to shoot video, although there is the option. The only bad thing I have to say about this device is that the battery charge indicator is on top of the camera rather than in the bottom. When the camera is powered on and charging it turns the battery indicator on. If it wasn't for that it would be the best value I have ever bought.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main problem I have is this device does not allow me to store my work files on it, so I have to write down notes I have already written and copy-paste it into my computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A good example of how a "new" device should be used is an old cell phone.   I have had an old   cell phone for the last 5 years. It is a Nokia 3310.  For the most part I like the design and design is excellent.  I do have a few niggles. I like that it has an AC adapter but I have one in my car that charges my car but not my   phone. The buttons are also on the   outside of the phone and the  speaker on the inside.  Battery life is not very good. The screen seems to have trouble with brightness.  At least if you are looking at the device from the front the screen is quite small. The   buttons are too large in my opinion and  should be more on the sides of the device.  The phone is very heavy and there is no way that I could use this phone as a mobile device. It has a very hard plastic in the back but the phone is quite bulky for something that small. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My girlfriend bought me a brand new tablet for Christmas.   It is a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  She had received another tablet in a box from Walmart as well.  It was not in working order.  We checked it several times and checked it a few more times, no working.  When we got home we discovered that it was completely busted and no replacement is in sight.  My girlfriend and I are both disabled and have trouble with our computers. She has a laptop and I have a desktop computer.  Our families have tried to help us.  What are we going to do? We are very upset.  Please return this to Walmart so that we can have our money back and get a refund.  A good review about an electronic device, but one that should have been better:  As with so many products I've purchased from Walmart, this new Samsung Galaxy Tablet is very cool, and it is very thin and light. I really like this new tablet.  This product, however, has some issues with it:  The display doesn't light up, so the color is very white, and there are very little colors.  The software has a couple of problems, but I would not have to purchase the second model to get the software correct.  I am looking at the second version of the software, but after 2 weeks of using this tablet I still have some software issues, so it doesn't match my previous models.  As with any tablet, I need to give my family time to get used to the new software.  With that being said, the tablet is a great buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are only 2 things you can count on from the Apple   product line: 1) The devices are great 2) The price is good.   A couple years ago,   Apple  sold a new   MacBook Pro   at a reasonable price.  The same thing happened with   the   iPhone 4S   last year.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have used this product for about 2 months now.   I use it daily, but only for short periods of time at a time. I have a small   (2 inch)   laptop with a USB port, and i can't get this device to work on any USB device (no matter how much I try). I've tried removing and re-installing the usb cable several times, and the only way to get it to work is to turn off my phone. It takes two hands to operate this device properly. I've gone as far as replacing the entire laptop.  This device is terrible to have to deal with.  It works great for a year now, but the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is still broken at the bottom.  I've put a new one in, and that one is great!   It has been in continuous use for almost 2 years and still breaks.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the WORST Ive ever owned. I was expecting the best, but this is a complete disaster and I am going to send it back. I've purchased a bunch of the old ones from Ebay and have never been happier with anything Ive owned. This is an epic failure. No screen, no touch screen, just bad, and useless hardware. I had expected this to be something that I could just put together and have a new TV, but when it finally arrived, I didn't even have the cable I wanted to use it with. I would never purchase one of these, and I have given several friends the cold shoulder about buying one. I'm going to have to send mine back because I won't be using it. The only thing it has going for it is the cheap price, but I am just not going to waste my money on a thing like this.   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem with the touch screen is that you have to manually press a button to turn it on (I'd have preferred to have a button in front of the touch pad). The screen is very sensitive and will wake the phone at any time. I would not recommend this device over a more powerful phone. If you like having a phone in your pocket and don't want to lug around a big phone with you, this is the device for you. It's the best phone that you can get.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -   The problem with my laptop is that the battery life is abysmal. There are days where I don't have power at all, but I use this as a backup. If I'm not running any apps I use it for a day and use the battery, then it dies. That's annoying. The sound quality isn't bad at all though, especially if you are doing some music streaming, I have had no issues with that so far. There is a light at the top that shines down, but that's the only nice feature I have found. The downside to this tablet is it's size, but this is something you have to deal with as a business owner:

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This computer is a disaster. The first thing I noticed was the fact that the display only displays 8 characters at a time. I thought it was just a problem with the display but the screen is a mess. When you use a mouse, you have to turn the screen upside down to get to the screen area you want. Also, the mouse does not work. I had to remove the battery from the mouse and then plug the power cord in. This computer would be useless if it did not have the ability to save and recall data from a microSD card. I hope the product is not discontinued.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the worst purchases I've made so far, I had to return my 2 years old ASUS RT-AC68U due to the fact that the back light was not functioning properly. Not sure if the problem is with my RT-ac68U or the monitor. Not that I had a need for such a thing in my work place, but this wasn't a computer I would use. I bought the RT-N66U for the same reason, and have also seen similar problems. As for the monitor, it isn't bad, but the LED back light just did not work correctly. I have a Philips 24" LG UHDTV as well. The LG has a back light issue as well and I believe it may be a Dell/LG issue as they have similar problems as well so I'm not sure why the LG was the only one with issues.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this thing about 3 weeks ago. I've had the thing for a couple of days and I'm so disappointed. I have no clue what the device can and can't do. It does the exact same job as my old computer, but I've found that it's quite a bit more difficult to use. First of all, I had to change the battery (not a big deal, but this thing's power is pretty weak). Secondly, I couldn't figure out how to make a new wireless dongle for it (even though I had a 3 port USB dongles from before). Thirdly, it's super difficult to connect to my laptop and switch between the two devices. Now I realize that maybe this device doesn't need an adapter like other computers? But that still wouldn't have helped me figure out the connection problem. Overall, this isn't a bad computer. In fact, it might be better than an old computer. I'm going to wait a couple weeks before I buy anything else from Tandy, though.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had a Samsung Galaxy S5 for almost a month now and i still feel like its missing something. The only thing the S5 has going for it is that it's a smartphone (i.e. it has a touchscreen). But I'm a huge fan of the TouchWiz interface and i have no problems with it. The S5 is very lightweight and super comfortable to hold. I still believe it is the best looking phone on the market and that is a rare feat for a smartphone.   If you still have to have a Galaxy S4, then go for it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The   i i   s  i o p s e n t s are   terrible .   I would prefer a   less   expensive   than   the  i. But   it   is   awesome  . I   could   have   spent   $200 or   more for   a  better   unit   or  $600   for  to   improve   my   experience.   5/10/2013 I bought this device in the hope it would improve my video game skills. Unfortunately, the unit has failed to do so. This is especially surprising considering the amount of time I've spent using the unit. This review is also to the best of my ability, but I'm sure there are many people who feel differently.  2/25/2014   A lot of my friends bought one and are unhappy with the product and it's performance. There are a lot of other people who have not been so happy with it, either due to it being defective or the device failing due to the fact that the customer service representatives for the manufacturer are either uninformed or not knowledgeable in the field and do not know any better. This device is not worth $200 on a promise. In conclusion, the video game device I purchased was "A" on a scale of 0 to 10 for quality, functionality, and service. I was "C" on each. The fact that a manufacturer should sell something as "A+" is a testament to the quality of their products. The quality and functionality of the video gaming device is below average, and the fact the the customer support staff for the video device was "D" is due to a failure to provide reasonable and accurate customer service. While it would have been better had the manufacturer's representative been more knowledgeable about the game and device, it is "B" on the scale in both regards. My recommendation is to save your money for something with better quality or better functionality. I am not disappointed that I paid the "A-plus" price for the product, but it was an A-minus in customer service from my perspective. I would not recommend this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You cannot get good service from a company that sells high end electronics,   they have poor quality control and poor customer service.   I got my device a week after I ordered it so I know the quality.  A week before the purchase the unit was broken and they had no solution.  I gave it a B,  If I did not have a computer in the house I would not buy a unit from any company, I have never dealt with such poor customer services.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Dwayne from Best price on this device and best features. No more broken parts. I have been using the Sony V1 camera for over 10 years.  This unit is far superior to the V1. I purchased a Sony VPL-W65, but this camera is very good in its own right. I also purchased the Sony 16-35 f/2.8, which also works great on the Sony. The size is excellent, light weight and easy to carry.  All the features I have seen on other V1 cameras are all included.  The camera will not accept Canon XLR inputs and will not fit a DSLR. I love the auto-focus and the picture quality is exceptional. I use it for landscape and portrait.  No more poor pictures that are out of focus and grainy.  You get great photos at a great price.  If you have a Sony device I would highly recommend this camera to you.

If you're looking for a big, heavy, bulky electronic device to play music off of, get something like the Walkman or the Samsung Galaxy S7.

I bought it in the hopes that he would enjoy his new digital experience, but he was not as enthused as I was. He complained of the ibrating not working and would not allow me to get a replacement for the defective unit (it wasn't my fault), and would often play with the screen. He also complained that it was difficult to charge and that it did not work when it was full. After about a week of use, my boyfriend was done with his iphones and we moved onto the ics. As we were buying our first iphono cable, I remembered that I would love to get it to work with the ialwa iwie. I didn't have the right cables, so I went on ebay to buy them. I purchased a replacement of my boyfriend's iphonocable for a whopping $70. This ipho cable does exactly what it needs to do, and is far more reliable than my boyfriends. I'd recommend the iac to anyone looking to get their iphonel to work. This is the ias of the iPod range, and I'd be more than willing to recommend it to anyone on that basis alone. I think the iam is the better sounding device, but if you want the best, you should definitely go with the iw.    Rated 4 out of 5 by mickdee from Excellent iphoned for a good price The iawiie works well with my ipod, good sound and music playing. But I wish the iahwie could do the same. It seems that this iawnie cannot do this, but the ihac can. I use my iiphone and ipod and this one is very good value for money, but this one has a little problem with the battery life which seems to be very short when connected to my ipods ipod. When the battery is about to go to the limit, the volume gets lower and then goes back to normal when the battery reaches the limit. I also bought the battery in the ichikamic but it does not work well with the ipod or the iaewie it seems. The ichiko is a little more expensive but works quite well.  ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this laptop. I really like the sound quality, however when I use it for internet browsing it gets REALLY hot. It has no back light and there is no fan. I use an old laptop on a old computer that has a backlight. It doesn't even light up if I close my laptop. My battery will die in the afternoon even if I am sitting at my desk. It took me three weeks to get it working correctly. I also ordered a keyboard that doesn't work well. I hope they add a fan when they ship to a US consumer. I tried to email the manufacturer but no response. I did get the warranty for free but I am not impressed. I am going to find a better brand.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Product but not as great as I expected. I purchased this laptop for a vacation to Australia. I'm not really a gaming type, however I will be gaming while I'm there. The laptop is absolutely gorgeous. The screen is a beautiful 1080p display. I've had my eye on this laptop since the original announcement. This is a very solid build, very solid. As soon as I got the laptop, I started playing some games, the performance was absolutely amazing. I love the speakers on this computer, however, they are definitely louder than they should be for such a small device. I can't speak to the battery life as I haven't had the opportunity to use it as much as I wanted. The only complaint I have is the keyboard. The keys feel very weak. I'd highly recommend this laptop as the specs are amazing. You should get one!  5 out of 6 people found the following review helpful: Beautiful laptop but... The keyboard is really comfortable and the screen is beautiful. I was worried about the heat in the back of the laptop. Not so. After a couple of minutes on the computer I felt much better. This computer is a beauty and can hold up to gaming very well. It is really fast too. It was like I was playing a new game.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I heard that this was going to come with a case, I was a bit skeptical. I know that sometimes you have to pay for a case when it comes with an item, but I always thought it was a little bit pricy for a $40 computer.   In all fairness, there is a lot of things about this thing that I love, but the case itself is a letdown.  I am not even going to pretend to be able to use the computer without a case.  The screen is horrible. It is very reflective. The hinges are awful. I can't get the hinge to hold the screen steady. The keyboard isn't bad. It has some decent keys, but it is the trackpad that is the killer.  It is so poor on the track pad that you have the feeling that someone took a large knife to it and just sliced it in half.  This is the worst mouse I have ever used. Â I have used a lot over the years, and this is the WORST I have used. I bought the mouse specifically because it had a rubberized grip, but that rubber is too soft and does not feel like a real track pad.  With this mouse, my cursor does not stay centered when moving up and down on the mouse pad. The mouse pad is not very wide either. I also find the surface extremely slippery. It takes a little getting used to the way it feels.  So what happens is, every time I want to click something, it just doesn't do it.  If you put the mouse on a surface that is flat, it will still click, but if you put it on a flat surface, like a white board, it won't click.  For some reason, I find it annoying, but at the same time it is a very nice touch.  Now the best part of the keyboard is that it has a very good number pad. It does not register errors or any other problems, and the trackpads are very responsive. I would say the keyboard may be the reason this thing is able to function as well as it does.  There is no cable management. There is only a single usb cable in the box. If you are like me, and you like to have at least a 2.4GHz radio, you will have to spend $20 on a cable just to hook this thing up.  In summary, I would rate this product a 3.75
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -The first time i tried to charge it, it took like 5 minutes. (It works fine after)  When I connected it, the screen was too bright, and the power was too low.  Then it just didn't charge, and it went to "0%", which means, that it's not charging at all, even if i'm connected to a usb hub.  is it the one on the list?  How do i reset this thing?  in my experience with these chargers (that are $20+), i can't get a charging status back, even after trying 5-10 times.  I don't have a usb cable. Is there a button to reset this? , not sure if I'll be able to make this work without a usb cables.   I can't say if it will work on other chargers. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you buy this item you are putting yourself in a very dangerous situation.   I do not like using this device, its too sensitive for me. The only good part about it is the charger,  The battery is a bit smaller than a moto x which can be a bad thing when you have to charge it in the car in a couple of hours.  I recommend this to people who only play League of Legends and dont want to mess with batteries.

Its been about 30 days now and i still havent been able to get a good connection to it.

Other then that its a really nice baby monitor with good quality.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad e-cigarette is just a bad e cig and e cigs are not always good.   This thing has too many problems to be called a good vaporizer.  The battery life is a joke, the draw is too weak and the taste is very poor.  This is not the best vape.   good   The new vaper i received as a gift and it was amazing the quality of vapor and power.  It's so much more portable then i thought it would be  Not good at all   I'm new to vaping and after trying two different vaporizers on the website I bought this. I was so excited when I received it but I was disappointed. It has problems. The battery last about 5 hours of continuous use with about 15 minutes of vape. And the battery is very light. And if you're on the go this could be an ideal product but if you have to have a portable vape then I would say get a better e-cig.  Vaporizer that can't compare to other Vape Pens   If I could give this vape a 0 star I would. I'm not impressed with it at all. It is more of a con than a feature.  My Vamo is way better in every way and I get it for only $50 less!  best I've tried   Love the cloud. Great taste. And a really long lasting battery  not really   Like other reviews it seems this one was a special limited edition. So I'm looking at a different brand.  Just like the other reviewers this thing is cheap. It just doesn't hold a candle to the other ones out there. . Not worth the $$$ This thing is just bad. I bought it because my co-workers all love the taste of this one. But they all hate the smell and I can't stand the vapor. This is definitely not a good deal. I don't get why vape companies are charging $49.99 for this thing. I really hope it goes back to being a $12.99 item.  as a vaporizer for a small amount of time... it just isnt worth it   For the price I paid and a very short usage of 3 days, it really is worth the money. But as a device for long term use I feel it can get worse and worse. Not a good choice for me. I won't be buying again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was using my Samsung Galaxy S4 in my room for about two months.  I noticed that the screen was yellowish.   The next day I tried to remove it from the computer and the LCD screen came off!   After that I noticed the screen seemed to be yellowish for a while after removing it.  As a result I was unable to use it at all.  A friend bought a similar phone for his desk and he has had no issues with this one.  Posted by    at 5:23 PM

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had to give it a star, as I have bought more devices in my life, and still have not found one that really works or works well. I thought I would give this one 4 stars, as it is not a bad device. I do like the design, it is very convenient to charge the battery (you just turn the switch to the right) and it is fast and silent when running. It has a few flaws: 1. When you turn it on, it says to turn on the front light, but when I turned it off, it said to turn the rear light on. 2. Battery life is terrible. About 10 hours of heavy use in 10 hours on a charge, and about 10 hours when on the charger. When it is on the battery is drained in 5 minutes when using this phone, and you can't even take pictures or video without it draining the battery completely. It is also difficult to operate the device, it takes way too much time to turn it back on. 3. No SD Card Slot for transferring music to the phone, only SD card reader for photos. 4. When using the touchpad on the back, it does not seem to be fully clickable, so it is more difficult to use. The best thing about this is that there are so many different features, you are not bound to just one type of phone. For example, you could use a smartphone, tablet, or even a digital camera (with the right app) and still be able to do all your basic tasks. The only negative thing I would say about this device is that it lacks a screen. All of the other features and design make up for that.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a bad product. When I got the box, it had a huge smell of smoke. It had no serial number. I had to go to the local electronics store to get a replacement battery. The batteries don't last a day. I thought they would last longer. The replacement batteries donï¿½t last a week. My phone will run for 2 hours then it has to be put in the charging dock for more power and a full recharge.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these on a whim, but they turned out to be not quite as good as I thought they would be.   These are not very good   The screen resolution is low, and they are difficult to turn on/off,   Also the sound is poor, and not very pleasant to listen to.  I have used a couple of other brands and they have better speakers and better features, but this one is still a little too low to be a good monitor.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from Great monitors This are excellent monitors. They are easy to set up and use. The sound quality is amazing. The colors are beautiful. The built quality is great. I am looking at upgrading from a cheap set of monitors I purchased. The price is unbeatable. Thanks LG  From the reviews, we thought these were going to be great monitors. Well, they were not. We were expecting some high-end features, great sound, and quality-looking monitors, but that wasn't the case. The quality-of-life issues were not as bad as we expected but still disappointing. In fact, the sound quality in this set is a little disappointing as well. I had no problem getting the speakers to work and the monitor to work at the same time. The speakers are quite good but not great. The only reason we gave the monitor a 4 is because we like having a big monitor in a small space. If we were able to get more space or even if the quality were better, we would have given it an even higher score.  Good monitors, good value! The sound is much better than I expected; the colors are good. It is very compact. The screen is a bit low, but if you can put it in a corner and you are able to watch a movie on it, it will work. The biggest issue I had was with the sound. The volume on the speakers was great, but the sound was really muffled. Other than that, I would recommend these monitors, especially if you are looking for a very good value.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The original iDevices was a fantastic product that is very affordable. Unfortunately, that is not the case anymore.   I am currently looking at other options in order to get my hands on one of these!   Note: this review is for the original iDevice i3 (not iDevice i3 Mini).  "This is the nicest Bluetooth keyboard for the price I've seen"   This is one of the best Bluetooth keyboards for the money. It comes with two different sizes of switches (the Cherry MX Red and Cherry MX Brown), two types of keycaps (black and blue), and a USB cable.  While the Cherry MX Green switches aren't as tactile as the red or brown ones, they are certainly a better choice for some people.  The white keycaps can be removed and used with other keyboards as well, but I'd prefer black.  I think the price is very reasonable for this device.  If you need to make a quick note or get something out of your pocket quickly, this is a great option.  I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this keyboard. "A great value, but there are no extras"  The unit I bought is just as described in the website - a basic keyboard with a couple of key caps, one case, and a small USB cable and charging cable. The USB cable itself is very short (6.5' long) which is good for portability.  But I don't see the point of having such a short cable (and the fact that you can't charge it is a bad design decision).   Also, I wish the keyboard was a bit more solid. I think it would stand up on its own better than the plastic keys that it came with.  Overall though, this product is great for the $80 it costs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first time I tried the T2, I was blown away. I was excited. This thing is amazing. But then I found out it was the worst piece of crap I've ever owned. It just never worked. It would turn on but not be able to communicate to me. My wife would have to call me and tell me it was ready and then call it back to tell me my phone was off the charger. My phone is so new, it never turned on after that. I had to purchase the "barcode" as the one that came with it did not work. Then the batteries would die after 8 hours. The battery charger would work after 1-2 hours. I took them all to the store but they did not have it with them. They suggested I get a different one. The only ones I found that would work were $40 off Amazon or $50 off of eBay. I don't want to say I gave up but I have decided to find something that works. For a fraction of the price I bought the one off of Amazon and it works 100%. If you don't like it, it's your fault for not paying attention and putting it down when you left the house. The product looks good, I just wish it worked. I really wish it was as good as I said. It's been years since I have been to a tech event so I will use this to compare it to some other stuff. This device does everything except for charging my iPhone and the battery does not last more than a few hours. That's it. I have another model T1 but I just bought this one on sale at $50 on eBay. This is the best thing ever. I just can't believe how bad the T1 was. The T2 was made for a different price than the T01. That is not a reflection on the quality of the T02 but a reflection of the higher cost. My only complaint is that it did take a long time to charge the battery. All the T3's are made in the same place but they all look different. This one has a slightly darker gray color to it. This might be a new version as the T03 and T04 appear to be made by the same manufacturer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you don't like the look and feel of an iPod, I think you'll find this just as good a product as you'd find in any other portable electronic device, including a compact flash drive. However, I have noticed a significant number of users who have complained about battery life. This is likely due to the fact that Apple is the first of the three major PC manufacturers to have sold a portable that doesn't require any external battery. The good news is that if you have a good quality battery, the battery life is comparable to what you would expect from a battery operated MP3 player that connects via USB. The bad news is the iPod can run down quickly, as the batteries only last about 2-3 hours on a single charge. Also, the size and weight of the device are somewhat less than those of its competition, but it's worth it to have a truly portable device that can be used to listen to the music that you listen to in your car.   Read a positive review about this product:  If You Think You Love Your iPod, You'll Like This   It's true that some people don't really love their iPods, but if you're one of those people, you'll be happy with this product, as it gives you that same music on the road that you have in your head. You'll also be able to listen while on the go and will not have to spend any more time on the phone, or go through the hassle of the interface you have to go through to change songs in your iPod. If you do own an iPod and can't stand the iPod interface, I recommend picking up an iPod Classic as well. This device is just as small as a classic, weighs the same and is just one click faster to get into the music, so the experience is identical.  This iPod, while small and lightweight, also provides full feature access and control with the iPod's intuitive iPod interface. The interface includes playlists, folders, radio, and the ability to search your music library by artist, album or genre.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For over five years now, this product has been a nightmare to operate.   This has to be the worst product I have purchased from a store since buying my first Apple   A year ago my iPod touch screen went dead. Â I purchased an Apple repair   and the man told me I needed to get the   entire screen out   as they would not fix the Â damage.  The damage was too severe and the repair would not be done.  After numerous phone calls, a visit to the Apple Store   for the repair and a promise of getting my   iPod touch fixed, I received a call from an Apple employee on August 4, 2014   telling me I had to come back in person.  I did and my iPhone 6 was repaired.  However,   I was shocked to learn that the man that repaired my Â iPod had said I needed the entire screen removed   by the end of this week or I would not receive my refund.  When I came back to get my iPhone I learned that the entire   screen had been removed and that I would need to pay $399 to have it replaced with my own money and I would have to come to the store again to pay the $399.  In addition,  it was clear to me that a man with very little Apple experience, with a tendency to not care about a customer's problem, would not put a second repair on my credit card.  So I left without getting my iPhone fixed and will likely never get it done. So you know what?   It's your responsibility to make sure your Apple product is working as it should.  If your product does not meet Apple's "Performance Perfection Standards" go to http://support.apple.com and use a certified Apple Authorized Service Provider. Â  This is the best and safest way to guarantee that your device is performing as it is supposed to.

I had my old computer up and running so it worked very well for me, but i found myself missing the keys on my old one.

If you're looking for a quiet keyboard, this is your computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device for an emergency emergency, but i'm happy to say i didn't even use it for that. It is a very small package, I couldn't even get it inside of my coat... (see my picture) So, I'll just say I'm very disappointed with this purchase, there are so many problems I had with this device (and that's not even including the fact the battery dies very quickly, it takes less than a month before it dies, it has a tiny, thin, plastic case that seems very flimsy, has a crappy button and is very easy to mis-press or have it not recognize what's going on) I would highly recommend against this product, and if you are in an emergency situation where you don't have a car, a laptop and don't really know what else to do, go ahead and buy this. If you don"t have a phone or a computer, or you're just looking for a simple, small and cheap way to get information, this is the way to go, and this has been the best purchase I've made so far, because the batteries last for so long, and I can also use my existing headphones for music if I wish to. For someone who wants a way to stay updated while out and about in a panic situation, this isn't the product for you...

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is probably the worst I have ever used for audio and not only is the sound terrible for the price but it's also completely unreliable. I recently bought a new laptop for my brother and I thought this would be the perfect way to plug it into a wall and use the sound as my computer. It has never worked with a wireless card and had to use a USB to Gigabit adapter. I have a MacBook pro and a MacBook Air and it's never worked at all on either. I am still using the cheap computer that came with the iPod. I just received the same item, still not working for my Apple products. I could not return it because it's broken. I don't want to have to have my laptop repaired because my laptop will work for no other reason. If I had known this product could have broken within 2 weeks and that it would have been an utter waste of money I would not have spent the money on it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm going to get into how a lot of these devices are awful and why, but first I want to talk about the product itself. The T-Mobile iPhone 7 is an average device. I would say that if you can live without a 3.5 inch screen, but still use a big phone, it's not a terrible device. However, that makes the 6 inch iPhone 7 Plus and 7 Plus Plus a great deal. The iPhone 7s, as mentioned above, is better in almost every way except for the display. The screen is great but I've had this phone for almost a month and the screen is now becoming scratched, or just not as good as I thought. The speaker is mediocre and the back of the device is still rather small. The camera is alright but not up to par with the iPhone 7. I will say that my phone is only 8 months old, so things are bound to get better in a few months. The battery is okay but it still doesn't compare to the iPhone 8. The most disappointing thing about this phone is that I don't want to have a big smartphone in my pocket. I like the 3.3 inch screen of the 6-inch model, but the smaller 4 inch iPhone is better and cheaper. I hope that Apple can fix the iPhone display, but I am a bit sad that I will need to carry a pocket-sized device.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this about 5 months ago, and i haven't been disappointed. My only complaint is the battery life is very poor.   However, it does have a great camera. I would definitely recommend this!  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Poor quality, poor build quality I was using this for a family project and it came apart at the hinges. I did a complete disassembly. They should not be able to use this as a camera without it being totally disassembled. I used it to shoot a birthday party for my grandchildren. The quality is very good. The pictures were sharp, the film is great. I wish that I could get the batteries back. But the price is too high.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed in the product.   It seems to be quite durable, but I've only used it for about 2 weeks.  It comes with no case, which is good because I don't really need one, but it doesn't have a micro-usb charging port.  The earbuds can be charged with a standard micro-USB cable, but they don't come with one either.  I think they would be even better with a 3.5mm plug to charge my other devices that need charging.  If you're trying to replace your earbud's mic (which is actually good for the price) I would suggest getting a micro usb cable instead.  Overall a good product, but a little pricey for what it is.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this about a week ago, with the hope of having an awesome stereo, but this thing sounds like a crappy stereo. The bass is pretty bad, the mid range is ok, but the highs are pretty much worthless. The sound of this thing is crap! I'm sure this is just a bad apple, but I don't recommend it.    Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Don't buy it Just got my new Bose speaker today. Not impressed. Bass is very weak and sub bass isn't good either. If you want a good stereo sound this is not for you. If I had to choose, I'd buy a Bose system and go back to my other stereo. If it were up to me, the new speakers would be discontinued and replaced by my $200 Hsu.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great keyboard. When I first heard about this keyboard, I was very impressed by its design. The back features a large spacebar (as opposed to a normal QWERTY) and an enlarged number row that allows the use of two number keys on each row. The number row has a very nice feel to it, and I like that the spacebar has a raised top lip and a larger diameter key. This makes for a very comfortable typing experience (I can type on my desk with my feet on my keyboard). The keys feel nice and sturdy. The layout is pretty good too (I have both a PS/2 keyboard and an IBM Model M keyboard and I can see this keyboard being pretty similar to the Model M). If you're looking for a keyboard with lots of space (or you want a nice keyboard with a big number pad), you might want to check this one out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the e-reader for my 16 year old son. I bought the book "E-Readers and Computers for Reading" because my son is an avid reader and he is still in elementary school. I did not find it easy to read the text on the screen. It seemed to have a lot of black lines. And the screen is not a glossy. It is a dark black that has some reflections but it is very hard to read on it. The battery was only 8 hours of continuous use. My son used to go up and down stairs and I think it got a little hot so I left the light on most of the time. He does not use it every day because he is so focused on getting good grades. He said that the pictures did not help him study and he just used his old book.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This   is the worst   I have   ever   had   found   on a   smart   device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â If the battery dies and you have to buy another one, don't expect a fast, accurate, easy-to-use device.   It is designed for a special purpose.  There are many reasons why a battery will fail:  Electrical problems (often caused by a defective battery cell) Battery shorts or short-circuits Short-circuit on the circuit board or a bad connection to a positive terminal of a negative battery Incorrect battery selection (usually from a battery company that makes defective batteries) Inadequate use of a battery that has been discharged to the point of no longer having any usable voltage.  Inadequate charging.  It is common for batteries to last for only 10 or 15 charge cycles.  If they last more than a year, you are going to have to replace them more frequently.  And of course, there are the occasional failures, but they are so rare as to be considered a minor inconvenience in the scheme of things.  What should you buy?   There is only one battery that will last, that is good for more than 10 charge cycles, and that is the 2200 mAh Panasonic BMS-10.  This battery has the longest battery life (12 months) of any battery in the battery industry.  Panasonic is a known manufacturer of high-quality batteries.  I would suggest these to anyone who needs an electronic device that will not give up quickly.  They do not use the older BMS types because they do not have the same performance and are much better quality.  A better alternative to the Panasonic BMR10 is the Panasonic PN-10R.  (It is a 3100 mAh battery that is similar to the BMR-10, but the BCR is set lower.)  This is not quite as long-lasting but has better reliability and better heat transfer properties. The BMR12 is also similar, but is not as long lasting as the PN.  The Panasonic BPR12 is a little better.  Although not as reliable as the BPR10, it is much more affordable.  Panasonic BMR15, BPR15 Panasonics BMR20, BMR21, BMP21, PN21, and PN22
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the wireless controller and I love it! I play my Gameboy but now I have to play my iphone. It's awesome to have a new controller for iphones. It took about 5 days to get to me but I am very happy with the controllers. I had to get an adapter for my icros because the original icrods doesn't work with the wireless one. It wasn't that hard to figure it out but it was a lot of work to get it to work.    I love it and I can play with my kids   You can play it with a wired controller (you can buy a USB one) and you can plug in any other devices that are wired (but you have to plug it into your computer)   This is an absolute bargain for a wireless controller. The only con I can think of is that you can't play with any other controllers because the game doesn't recognize it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A little over a year ago, I was looking for a good digital watch. I was surprised to see that a number of them are not very good.   This one was $80 and the price seemed right.  The battery lasts a while.  When I'm not looking at my watch, I'm just using it.  Very simple to use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â  If the display is good, then it's very good.   But the resolution is horrible.  The display is much lower resolution than a real CRT.  It is like looking through a very bright LED.  I would give it one star but it is not perfect. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "It works ok.    It's a nice looking unit.  It gets the job done.  If it's your main computer (i have an HP laptop) then it's great.  I have my work computer hooked up to it and it is a little more quiet than the others.  As far as the product itself I think it works fine.  The only thing I'm not really happy about is the fact that I paid almost $100 and they only gave me a return key.  That is kinda expensive.  They said they would send one, but not the next day.  "
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing that came up was a loud buzzing. I thought it was the device's power cord. So I just left it plugged in and went to bed. Next morning I noticed it buzzing again. So, I unplugged it, plugged it back in and it was silent for about 30 seconds.   After that, it came back. Again, it was extremely loud, buzzing for the first minute and then silence after about 15 minutes.  I didn't even turn it on because I knew it would make noise.  This thing is not designed to do the work I expect a computer to do.  One more thing, this is NOT a "keyboard" computer.  It has a very strange design for one thing and it is also not ergonomically designed for those with disabilities.  The keyboard is a tad small, you cannot reach some keys, and if you have small hands it is impossible to use the mouse.  With all these things, this device needs a lot more attention than it received.   Best of the worst:  Yes. The new Samsung S9 phone is really just a Samsung S8 plus. Yes, the specs are better, and you get the latest and greatest hardware. But is it worth a buy? Yes.  For the money, it's an amazing device that provides you with everything you might need and more.  What are some of your favorite devices?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They had a big screen, but it could only display 2 things on it; the menu and a picture on the bottom. The menu was extremely confusing and when I tried to change it, I had to do it again with different settings.   When I switched it to video mode it would only display a picture that I could only see from a very far distance.  In addition, the screen would shake so badly that it would flip up and down as if it were on fire, even when I turned it off and on again.  If you have problems with this device, I do not recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It would be great if the phone could be uninstalled and used as a portable music player.   However, the phone is not very user-friendly, and many problems can occur when trying to do simple tasks.  Also, the device seems very old, and I find it hard to believe that it was used for such a long period of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound was terrible, I could not hear any of the other people around me, so I turned the volume way down. I also had to purchase a $39.99 new wireless speaker because it would not connect to my phone.   For a phone speaker, I would rather have my iPad or   Nexus 7 than this thing, and that is why I returned it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently bought this to replace an old Sony Walkman and I can say with confidence that you will be glad you did. The only thing that bothers me is the size of the player (it is about 5 inches deep and about 2 1/2 inches wide) I wish it had a smaller player. The buttons and control panel are nice but it really doesn't feel as premium as an iPod.    Great Music Player   This is a great player. I use it with my computer for my MP3s. I am on the way to buy an iPad but I hope i don't have to wait too long.  iPod 5s - not a stand alone product   The iPod 5s is a nice piece of electronic music equipment that has a huge feature set compared to the iPad but the player is a bit too big for my use. For me this device was not a good value since I bought a new computer last year, so I am considering dropping the $300 for a stand-alone device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a bit cheap and the build quality is very poor.   After using this device for a few days, I realized that there is NO way this phone would last any more than a week or two. I'm not a very strong person, and it took a lot of effort to hold it down for a full day (as I had to, I had it in my hand for 5 hours)   I still use it, but I won't be buying one any time soon.  This is a very good phone, however the battery life is nothing special. In fact, it is very disappointing that I didn't get more battery life out of it, even for my limited usage. I don't think I have ever had a better battery life on a phone than this. However, there is a better phone out there than the G4 Pro. If you need a device for doing work, you can't go wrong with this one. But if you need the best battery life, then go for something like the Nexus 6P. It is not a bad device by any means, it just isn't as good as the Nexus, so you should buy a Nexus instead.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have never given a bad review about anything, but I am a bit reluctant about using an electronic device without a rechargeable battery, so I bought this, knowing that it would be battery-powered.   My main use for it is to read my email and surf the internet, but it did NOT last a week.  I have had it for about a month now, and I have a hard time remembering to put the charger in or unplug it. I am going to wait for a replacement, but if I have to buy another one, I will not be a fan of this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A lot of the people using this product seem to be having problems with its performance. The sound quality is terrible, it's just not worth it. It's also extremely expensive. I've had a couple other $500 devices before and this is not as good as the others I've used. Maybe it's the speaker or the microphone? Either way it's too expensive for what it delivers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The worst thing about this is the fact that they need to charge it once per day. They also come with a plastic protective case and a sticker on the outside of the box that has to be taken off after each use. I am not sure if this is normal for all of these models, but it was a deal breaker. Also, the charger is a little loose in the charger box. I have it on a wall mount so I can use it but then the cable comes loose from the plastic cover. The case comes off by the plastic handle on the side and you cannot get the battery out unless you use the included tool that is way too small to reach the batteries. It has the words battery & charger in large letters.    Rated 1 out of 5 by Mikes from Awful. I bought this a couple months ago as a gift for my son who has been wanting this kind of controller for a long time and never got it because I have a large home theater system with lots of electronics and electronics, but now I have to buy another brand which is the biggest disappointment. They sent it to me damaged in the box. If the battery had not been broken I would have returned it. The controller is NOT upgradable. When I bought it they mentioned that it will be upgraded to work with 4.2ghz wifi and I don't know if that is true or not. It still works fine with my older controller. And the new batteries do not come with the charger and the usb cables to connect the controller. Also it is not a full size USB port but a mini port which is really hard to plug in. If I can get through to the customer service department I will complain to the manufacturer, but for now I cannot recommend this controller. I would highly recommend other models over this one unless you absolutely want to upgrade your home theater systems in a few years and need 4.4ghz and don't care about wireless features. I know there are better controllers.  From the reviews of this product and others like it, I have bought this controller in other colors, and it did not work well, however, when I bought a new one, the problem was not solved. It would turn on and off and then reboot to boot. If you are planning to use it on any of your equipment, make sure you look around to see what is already out there that is a good controller and does not have problems like this
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Great product for the money. For the money it works fine. The only complaint I have is the volume knob and that there is a cable to the unit. If the volume level knob is replaced with a volume slider, it would be perfect.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jimc123 from Love it I have a bunch of these in my garage to replace some of the old ones. I find myself getting more and more use out of them.    Rated 4 out of five by jwc12312 from Good quality This is a good quality product and works great.   Thank you for the review John. It sounds as good as it looks and you have an option to have the cable replaced with cable plugs so you can use these with a portable amplifier. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (click to enlarge)     My biggest complaint about this keyboard is that it has very stiff keys.   I have been using a Cherry MX switch keyboard for a while now but I still hate the stiff key feel of the Cherry MX switches.  I am not a keyboard fanatic, but I use this keyboard all the time and my fingers still ache from the stiff keys (even with the "slide" key switch). It may be that my hands are tired from typing for a very long time (I work in an office), but it doesn't make me happy to type on a keyboard that hurts my hands like this. If you have an MX switch (or any other keyboard) and find that you want a little more "give" to your keyboard, try using one of my Cherry MX "soft" switch keyboards.  The keyboard is very nice if you need a light, compact and affordable keyboard.  If you are looking for a compact, quiet, good quality keyboard with a Cherry mechanical switch, look no further than this keyboard.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this for a "warranty replacement" for a failed power bank I bought in 2006. The device is almost 5 years old now and I just got back from a week long camping trip. It's just been running at 50% charge and has been completely dead since returning from the trip.   In addition to that, the original battery I bought for the power bank also failed, so I was hoping the same thing wouldn't happen to this unit. I had to replace the entire power bank as the original ones died after only a year or so. I have no problems with the original power bank, but I can't even get this device to charge at least an hour per day since I can only get about 1/3 of the juice from the "quick charge" connector. It'll charge, but doesn't seem to want to.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad device should not cost $$$$    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good for the money I needed a computer for home use, but with a little modification I had a working one in about a month. It's not the fastest, but it was enough for my needs. I don't care for the touch screen. I do like the fact that it does double as a portable fan.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -The device doesn't work well,   I couldn't use it.   It's too expensive   for the cost of materials   and the materials are poor.  In addition,  it's heavy   on my hand.  Â   -It has a faulty battery,  This should be replaced.  -You should only use it when you are away from home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have to say that I don't know how it will hold up over time.   The build quality was horrible and it was extremely frustrating to have to buy another $50+ model when I already have the old one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use this device and love it. My husband uses a cell phone and is also very pleased with it. I have bought 2 more for my husband and I now have a third to replace when we have our new baby.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is a joke. I would get a battery pack from the Apple store and then buy a new one. Then I would also get a charger which is way over priced.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Ddavins from Amazing for my project I'm building a computer that is intended to work with the Raspberry Pi. The only problem with it is that a micro SD card is not included and instead you have to purchase one of those with your Raspberry Pi as well as some extra cables (not included). This works perfectly. Once you have everything connected, you can type in the commands on the remote desktop and it just works. And the picture quality is amazing! The remote is also very simple. It's nice to have the ability to customize it so you can adjust it to your liking. I think it's awesome that you can use the USB connection to access your phone and the remote and make it easier to connect/disconnect your RaspberryPi. Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to put together a computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this phone thinking it was just a better quality model than my SGS3. I was wrong. It's a better phone for your pocket, but the camera is worse. It doesn't get any worse than a 5 megapixel shooter on a phone that takes pics in RAW at the highest resolution. The picture is sharp, but not the best. The audio quality on this phone isn't bad. I like the phone to play videos in HD or better. I just don't like the camera in any way. I wouldn't have bought this if I didn't have a SGS 3.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you are buying a new smart watch to replace a worn out one, look elsewhere. The display is very small and the buttons are hard to find. But the price was a steal, so that is not really the main problem. This watch is a piece of junk. This is not a good watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   In the last article I reviewed a very good portable keyboard and the next I'm going to review a bad portable keyboard, and this time I'm talking about a portable computer keyboard. First of all the laptop that I have is an Asus T300, which is the T-series in China. In other words, the model that most Chinese manufacturers use for this price range (which is about USD 200 for a keyboard/mouse combo). Asus makes the computer so cheap that you really can't complain. And as I'm already a user of this model and I love it I decided to review it.   I'll also be reviewing a cheap laptop that does not have a keyboard, a cheap notebook, an old Apple laptop that works well enough, and a really old PC from the early 90's which has a keyboard and mouse.  It comes in a plastic box with a sticker with the model name and a model number, but no other model. The box is very big and heavy and the lid is metal. The top is very thin and light, it is quite solid.  There is also a power brick in the top. It's the usual one but I would imagine that it is pretty old. It doesn't really look too bad but it is the thickness that is the main problem for me. The USB ports are only one on the right side of the laptop, and in the front there is a mini-DisplayPort on the left. On the bottom there are USB 3.0, USB 2.0 ports and a headphone jack. It has an internal antenna and Ethernet ports.  I haven't tested everything yet but it appears that this thing will have a decent battery life.  The only thing that I think the keyboard is lacking is the actual backlight and maybe the keys could be made of a bit better material.  With the laptop I use I've found that I don't need backlight on my keyboard, I can just use my light, which works surprisingly well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product itself is good. The issue is the charging dock it comes with (if that's even a thing) and the USB connection cable. The dock is not made well. The ends are so bent they won't stay plugged in. It comes with a short USB cable and a USB charger that only has one USB port. If I were to give this product an 8/10 I would say it's worth the money. It works great. But you are paying for a brand new dock (not a refurbished one) with a poor connection that is bent.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (Note that this will be a very small section of this review:  "We used our first iPad (a 13-inch model) for about a year, but by then, we'd spent over $1,500 in parts and repairs on the device. The device had broken the first two times we used it; the third time, we broke the screen, which had been replaced on the third attempt, so we decided to use our old, slightly-faded, but still functional and full-functioning tablet."   - This iPad's screen, despite being one of its biggest weaknesses, is still one of the best screens out there. The display has a resolution of 2048x1536 pixels.   A good feature of this screen is that the screen can be flipped open so that you can see both the tablet and the display at the same time.  Â  This is very useful if you want to use the device for web browsing, or as a reading aid.  A single tap of the Home button will cause the screen to wake up from its sleep mode and display the user interface. The software has a fairly minimal interface that is quite user friendly.  As a result, I find that I spend far less time than I would have on a phone or a tablet switching from one screen to another, and I actually find myself using the iPad more for general tasks and reading.  I also feel that, due to the simple interface, there are no "janky" interactions (such as keyboard navigation that is not fluid, menus that get in the way, etc.).   An example of the simple, clear user interface is a menu in which a user can set various options, such as how many pages to load in the new book, or what kind of book to read in the iPad.  The layout is fairly minimal as well, with the text on the screen being almost always large enough to be seen and not very small.  The Retina Display  The resolution of the iPad is impressive.  At the time I purchased the iPad, I was extremely disappointed in the resolution of iPad's, as it has a typical 1024 x 768 resolution.  However, after trying the iPad Pro, I now have no problem playing games like Borderlands 2  on the iPad Air 2.  I can use the iPad's touch screen and still be able to read a book.  This is not to say that the resolution is not sufficient, though.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     1 month after purchase:  1 month after purchasing:  First of all, I'm disappointed. I bought this for my grandson, and he was quite excited to get his first tablet. I gave it to him today. He looked at it and told me, "It's terrible. No picture is sharp enough and I don't understand what a keyboard is." He said it was really hard to turn the thing on. I had it set up right in the kitchen when he got it and he said, "Man, this thing is hard to get onto the tablet." Now, he hasn't played with it yet, but he said he was very surprised that he couldn't get it onto the table. I was so happy with it, I didn't realize how horrible it was until I opened up the box. When I got it home, I looked at the warranty and it said, but the tablet wasn't actually that bad, but I guess if the warranty doesn't cover this, it doesn't make sense. I am so disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you do something to damage the device but have no intention of returning it, I wouldn't return it. It's just too expensive to do that. If I were to return something it wouldn't be the $99 AppleTV. It would be the other $99 devices. I'm not saying that it's always a bad idea to take an item to the Apple store and try it out.   If you want to check the compatibility, and it does work, I'd suggest you buy the other device.  But if you don't need it, don't buy it.  It doesn't make sense to spend $100+ dollars on an electronic device, only to have it break the day you get it home.  That doesn't mean that you can't bring your broken AppleTV to a store and make it right.  The Apple Store staff are very helpful and will make sure you have everything you need to get the device working.  I would recommend that you bring the AppleTV with you.  If the Apple Store doesn't have it, they will ask you if you want it. If you say "yes", they will look in the TV section for a unit that works.  They can tell you the exact models and prices.  You'll be told when to make an appointment and what the turnaround is.  For most people, it's easy to just ask "Is this what I'm looking for?"  If they say no, ask if it's an open box and the tech will make an adjustment if necessary.  Make sure that you take photos if the tech asks you to and take a note of what they tell you is necessary. Also, make sure to bring your receipt (or phone) of when you made the purchase, as well as a receipt that shows the current prices of the models you're looking at.  There's nothing worse than a good deal that's only good for a month.  Hopefully, you bought the device after they started taking Apple TV units back and don't have to worry about buying it again.  This is your chance to make a big splash on Apple TV! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I was a kid, my uncle had a really bad old-time Radio Shack radio that worked really well. It was a good antenna, and I never had a problem with reception. I used it a lot, because it would hold the receiver on the back of my car and it was small enough to put in my pocket. I loved my Radio Shack until one day when I had just bought a new TV I saw that my uncle's radio was still working just fine. I thought it was a mistake. I called the number on the radio and said, "My old radio won't go. What's wrong?" The technician who answered the phone said "Well, just to let you know, we don't sell radios that are no longer sold." When I got home and checked the radio I discovered that it had died.   I returned it to Radio Shack, bought a TV and never looked back.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am using this with an iMac and a PC to watch movies. I've never used a tv box before. I have a Sony PX-100. If you're going to spend $200+ on an entertainment machine, get the PX, not the TV box. The cable is bad too. My iMac will only output HDTV.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Disapointed I love the features of this TV Box. However, I bought this TV box to watch TV, movies, and game on my TV screen, not to play games on my Mac. I was disappointed when I found out that the only games I could play were ones from the store. I had to purchase a game on the app store just to get the TV Box to play the game. I wish they would just ship a different game, or include some other TV Game I could enjoy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I bought this product expecting to be able to use it in a 3d printer, and it was a little bit disappointing that it wasn't a 3D printer. The quality was decent but it didn't print well enough. There were too many parts that were poorly assembled, and the plastic part seemed to be falling off from time to time. This was mainly a problem with the top of the base where it comes together. The print was a decent one at the start, but that was about it. I bought this because I thought it would be useful for the 3d printers but it wasn, and is, not the right thing for that use.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from great thing. Works well in my Xyz printer. This thing is a monster, I just have an old 3d printed tray and I don't think the Xyz will have enough room to hold it, but I guess I won't have to worry about it not fitting in it. It is easy to assemble, and easy to print. I have not printed the electronics yet but I am excited about that. I will get the electronics when I get the Xz's and will report back on that.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     No one likes it when I come home and find a pile of rubbish in the house.   It's almost always full of cables, accessories and cables!  This one is so poorly made and made to be picked up off the floor - even when using the right sized screws!  It looks like the quality control is so poor that all the cables are coming loose.  There are a number of tiny scratches and chips everywhere - the motherboard is even dented!  Not sure why this had been bought, it's a total waste of money.  The box is also missing the power connector which will mean you need to go for the more expensive power supply.  If you don't have a PC and the price is right then you'll probably love this - but I'd steer clear, if you can! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a very new wireless keyboard, this one (USB) for my computer. I have a Lenovo ThinkPad X200 laptop and this is a wireless keyboard which I bought as a "nice to have" for my new computer (x200). I was disappointed with the quality of the keyboard, so after a week of using it, I decided to return it for a better keyboard (I have an Apple keyboard). When I looked at this keyboard and started to feel the quality, I could not believe how cheap and bad it looked. The keys are very "squishy" so they feel like they would fall out. The USB cable is very poor quality and the plug looks cheaply made. The cable doesn't have a clip and is very short. Also, there is a very obvious manufacturing defect with the bottom of the USB port. I also have a laptop with a good keyboard (Logitech K400) and the keyboard is much better quality and much more stable. There are many other things I dislike about this keyboard: Â   Â Keyboard can be broken when in use:  This is very unusual, as most keyboards have a "satisfaction switch" which makes it hard to break it. When I tried to put it back on, the key felt like it had a lot of force to it, so it wasn't as easy to take off again. You can also easily bend the key on the bottom: This also isn't the case for this keyboard, although it is annoying to bend it and cause a lot more stress on the USB cable. Keyboards usually have some sort of "firmware" to detect the shape of your fingers, and prevent the keyboard from breaking:  To be honest, I don't like it very much. When using this keyboard (it's supposed to be a keyboard for the computer not a tablet/keyboard), you just can't feel the shape the finger is making when you are typing. The fact that you can't "feel" it in use, makes me feel a lot less like typing on this keyboard than I would if the keyboard was designed well and had a "fist" to the keyboard so I can feel my finger when I type.  The bottom has a very odd curve when typing:  My laptop has a curved keyboard and I can't imagine anyone wanting to use this one. You would have to use it very carefully to not break it (although I wouldn't recommend trying this

But it is just not a good device in my opinion. It is so frustrating using it! If it were me, I wouldn't buy it.  Review of DJI Phantom 2 Professional Review by Jeroen Location: Amsterdam, The Netherlands   Cost: â¬ 499   Specs:  Operating Temp: -10â -50â  Flight Time: 2h 30min   Photo Gallery: http://www.dji-photos.com/phantom2   The Phantom 2 Pro is the first pro-grade camera that comes with a gimbal and a stabilized HD camera, which is awesome. With a 1/8 inch screen you get to see a lot more, even in low light. You can control the camera with a simple stick or an Xbox controller, the best one out there.   It has a wide dynamic range and it is a solid all-rounder. The gimbar and HD camera are not expensive, but they are well worth it. If you want the best quality for the money, go for the Pro. You'll be happy.   the DJI Mavic Pro's a more expensive camera, and it has a much larger sensor than the Phantom 2.  the Mavics have a more impressive stabilization system. Also they are larger, and the flight time is longer. The Mavites can handle more aerial shots, the Phantom's aren't as flexible. The DJI is also cheaper, and for that you get more flight time.   The DJIs come with a small remote control with the option to buy an extra one.   at a first glance, the MAvic Pro looks and feels as nice as the Phantom. With the gimbuam and the extra HD camera they have created a whole new world for aerial photography.  I really like the Mavi's, and I'm quite happy with the DJIs.   and DJI do a great job marketing them as well as supporting them. DJI does a great Job with marketing them and I can't imagine myself not buying a Phantom or Mavii when they become available.  - Jeroens reviews DJI Inspire 2. It's cheaper than DJI drones, but you should expect the Phantom to last longer. Beware the DJi

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm sorry, but I can't give this product any more stars than that. The original version of this was designed to work as a remote control for a radio transmitter. However, it did not have a separate battery or the type of batteries that we use for our radios, so when the battery died (and it died in under a year, and it's the only one that ever did) I went and bought a $3 receiver and that works just fine. Now, when I go to my radio, the same problem happens, but this one has a more expensive replacement receiver! If I was willing to pay $3, I could have got something with better performance and less problems, but as a consumer who is not familiar with the technology, I was very disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a very interesting device, and it is good if you are looking for a lot of things at once. I think it could be very useful if you have to go shopping at once, or if you want to go somewhere and you want everything quickly and efficiently. For those reasons, I think the best use for this device is a kitchen counter top, or a small office table. The thing is quite large, so it's not great if you don't already have a large surface area. However, if you do have that big table, then you'll love how easy it is to get up to speed on anything on the screen at a glance. I have had a number of problems with the device. I first purchased it to connect my iPad to my TV (which I have since replaced). At first I just plugged the device into the wall, but I had a few problems with it connecting. When it did connect, it worked great, but it didn't recognize my iPad, so I had to go into the TV set and plug it in there. After that problem solved, I plugged it in to the iPad, and everything worked great. I then had another problem with it not recognizing my Mac (which is still in use), and then it started having trouble connecting to other things, like my cable boxes. After some troubleshooting, I eventually got the problem fixed with a new screen (from Best Buy), but the whole device is still pretty fragile. If you're going to use it as a screen, or in a larger space, I would definitely not recommend it. If it were in the kitchen counter, then I'd give it five stars.

I use a little rubber band and the remote always falls out, and if you need to adjust volume or make changes in the app, you have to use the touch screen.  and not too sure about the quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you ever used a calculator, you already know what I'm talking about. A calculator was a fantastic invention that was used for hundreds of years before the electronic calculator even existed. As a kid, I used to get excited when I would use a calculator and use it to calculate something with the right answers. Then when I got older, I would get bored when I couldn't use a computer or have to remember to input things with the keyboard and paper. I can't tell you how many times I would pick up a calculator only to have it crash, and then I would have to go back and do it all over again. I was also really disappointed when the calculator I got for my college graduation didn't work as well as I had hoped. A big part of the problem with the calculator was the computer that was connected to it. The computer was running very slow and taking forever to process. Even when I used my computer for something other than calculator, the computer often crashed or would freeze. The only time I have ever heard of a computer crashing or freezing on a calculator was on a 3-digit calculator I was given as a Christmas present.   I wish I could take back the calculator.

There's no software built in; all you can do is browse through the pages and listen to the sound. I'm not sure why the manufacturers have a lot more expensive version to sell, since the "basic" is more than enough to meet a lot less people. I would say get the "Basic" and a good earphone amplifier if you want to listen to music or some mp3's. The speakers aren't very good, but that's the only thing that bothers me. I could do better with a portable. But at $90 it's pretty reasonable.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

We love the JBL powered system but we were looking for something that would give us the sound we were used to from the Pioneer. The JBL Pro 3000 has a very nice range of sound. I am not a big fan of the EQ. It has a lot of bass and mids, but it is not the type of bass I would want to listen for long periods of time. The sound is warm and smooth. It is not very detailed but if you are into the more detailed sound you can not beat the sound of this system. I can not comment on the build quality, but the system is well made.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a fantastic piece of hardware that performs its function well, however, in my humble opinion, it is a very simple design. Its plastic shell is very simple, with a soft plastic body, two large buttons on the front, and a small joystick that I've had trouble controlling. My only complaint about it is that it has two different types of power. I can't be bothered to switch between them, but it would be better if it did have a switch that was simple, such as "off/on", and if you were to turn it on, the lights would stay on for a few seconds. But that's just nitpicking. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Don't buy this, it's trash!   I have a couple of these, one that came with my phone and I've been very happy with it. This one is a huge disappointment. I have it in the front pocket of my jeans, and I have been constantly getting the same annoying message on the screen saying, "Your device is not in range." I don't think I have ever had a problem with my wifi before, but when it came time to make a purchase I looked into it and found out that it has been in the field, and the "out-of-range" is a result of being in a place that does not have the wifi. I am very disappointed in this product.  Awesome product!  In-Depth Review   When I first got the phone, I noticed that it was pretty small (almost 2 inches in height) so I was a little worried that it would be a tough fit in my pocket. The good news is that I have to say that it is actually great to have the phone in my back pocket. I can pull it out of my back pouch and place it in my front pouch. Since I have such a small pocket space, I don not know if it will be comfortable when it's in my rear pocket. So I plan on trying a bigger one for when I need it in a back pocket for a call, or a movie. Moral of the story: if you have the money to spend, I highly recommend this phone, but if you are on a budget, and don't want a huge "monster" device, then this is not for you.

Now, after having it for a couple of months, I don't really like it at all. The keyboard is bad, the trackpad is bad. It's kind of hard to use this one as a computer because there isn't a big touch screen or a mouse. You are better off with a laptop with a touch screen and a mouse." - John S.

If I had a real QWERTY keyboard, that might be a problem, but this is still a very good keyboard.  Good buy, only thing is that it can take too much stress on it. This could be good for a long term purchase. But if you use it for 1-2 hours a day, or when you're in a rush, don't expect miracles.  and it looks great!  i love it  I absolutely love this keyboard and the quality is very good, It's a really good keyboard with a nice key feel, I highly recommend it if your looking for a mechanical keyboard.

One day I get an email from the company asking if I would like to be put on a free trial program so I will try the phone again. The next week I get a similar email asking if there is anything that the company can do to make this better. I told them that I wanted to leave a negative feedback about the product so that they would try to fix it. So I did. In a few days I received an email saying that they had tried everything to make the problem worse and the next day I recieved another email saying the problem was fixed.

I don't understand how this would have been any good at all without the mechanical switch, and I've used keyboards that cost more than this, and didn't have any problems.  You will have to invest a lot more to be happy with it:  Overall the keyboard is a good design, with a good keyboard layout, good quality plastic construction, and great price. It's not perfect, but for a product for a very low price it is a great buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The keyboard on my laptop was very cheap and has a bad habit of constantly skipping key presses.   I also find that the trackpad isn't very sensitive (it's a little sensitive when I'm on my 3 hour flight ).  I have to put a lot of effort to click on windows when the trackpoint won't.   Other than that I'm a very happy camper. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem with this device is its very slow response time, I can't even type a review about this device. I wish I could go back to using my old iPhone, it was a very pleasant experience but you had to pay a lot for this device to get the most out of it, at least with the iPhone there was a built in phone and you could make calls, this device just doesnt work. It just goes right to sleep, sometimes it wakes up but when it does it takes a couple of seconds to do anything, not the first time I have used it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      The problem I have with this is that I use a wireless keyboard, which makes me very unhappy, as the wireless key can become very dirty, it can also drop out of my computer easily, so I have had to replace a couple of my wireless keypads which were already dirty. And this is a huge problem as I bought it to use with a bluetooth keyboard. I really wanted to use it with a wired keyboard, but since I'm not going to put the keypad into my computer anymore, I can't do that, as there's no way to put it back into it's place in the keyboard, so if the key is dirty, you can't put it in, if the wireless device is dirty you can never use it again. If I had the choice of using a wired or wireless keyboard with this, I would absolutely not buy this, and I'd have to buy a blu ray keypad. That would be a huge mistake in my book. I can understand why this device is being sold, it's advertised as being cheap and it is, but I would prefer a blu-ray/usb device rather than a USB device with blu-rays for $4.95 per blu ray, as that's the price of a decent blu-Ray player. For that price you should expect a blu rays player with all the accessories that come with it, not a cheap plastic device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the 2nd computer I purchased from this vendor and the first one was defective. The screen was permanently stuck at a fixed level (it wasn't rotated). I tried to "reprogram" it, but the program couldn't save. My only option was to return the defective one. In the past, the best service I got was from this company because they took the time to look at my defective device, fix it, and send me a replacement. Not this time. After sending a defective item back, the company told me to "come back within 30 days." I was very disappointed that this "manufacturer" doesn't bother to think of their customers. This vendor is a waste of time and money!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor after buying a new Apple iPad Mini (the iPhone 5).   It looks pretty good.   Unfortunately, it is not as good as the iPad.  If you have a PC, I would get the Apple one.   If you have an iPad Mini or an iPad Air, this may look better than the iPad Mini.  For me the only issue is that it does not have a 3D function. The iPad Mini, while not perfect, still looks very good. This monitor does look good.  I have 2 of these in a basement where I do some of my video editing, and one on the couch. I use the iPad Air for watching videos. They both do great for watching, editing, or doing anything video related, and it's hard to see the difference between them and the iPad mini. It's nice to have a big screen and not have to be afraid of getting it dirty. So far, they both do fine for what I'm doing. And it's cheaper than Apple. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was a little wary to buy this device as my only experience was with my    old   Apple   iPad   3. I was not expecting such a big difference, however,   it is very apparent that Apple has really put a lot of effort in this new version.   The touch screen is responsive and the device is extremely smooth and easy to use.  The only downside I have is that   sometimes the touch screen does not feel as responsive as it did on the   iPhone 3g   and the iPad 2.  One thing to note is that the battery life is poor, only getting through about an hour of moderate usage before I had to recharge.  I highly recommend this purchase to anyone who is looking to buy an easy to operate, smooth and powerful touch screen tablet.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     My device failed after the 3rd month so I am just using it for streaming. No good quality audio though so if you want to use this device to listen to your music, it's not gonna be good!  Noise and low quality audio.  This is the first product I have purchased from Violectric and so far I am not impressed. I wanted a wireless headset but didn't want to pay more for it. I didn't expect it to do what it does, it doesn't, it makes me uncomfortable with all the buzzing and low-quality sound. The sound from it is terrible and the battery is barely getting through the time I use it. This isn't an issue of it not being wireless, it is an issue that the product itself doesn't do what is advertised or that it is too expensive for what it promises.  a few of my concerns: 1. The cord on the headband is way too short and it gets in the way of my ears and the microphone. 2. The volume control is a joke. 3. I have had a few Bluetooth headset in the past but the quality has never been better. This is the most underwhelming product I've ever purchased.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really like this one, and i use it for many hours everyday, it's a big improvement from the last one i had, but it still has problems. I was very disappointed about the battery that came with this one. The battery life is terrible, i can barely get 2 hours on 4 batteries, and then the next day it will last about 1.5 hours or less, just nothing, not enough to do anything. The USB charger was a little less than good, it was charging fast, but then it would not stay on when i needed it to. I bought a second one for the $15 price difference, and it works perfectly. Overall i think this is a good buy, it is a little pricier than the original.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this item about a year ago, and I loved it so much that I ordered a second unit. It does not charge at all, which is a problem if you are traveling and have no chargers on you. It's not the case if you have an adapter. I also had the device replaced when my second unit died a few months ago. I had not had a problem with the first, but now I have both of them. The first unit had two problems, which were minor in my opinion: 1. the charging port is a bit too long, meaning it's impossible to plug it in without getting a small dent in it. 2. there is no power indicator, so you have to turn the charger on in order to charge. The second one had two issues, which are not so minor in the long run: 1- the battery is not replaceable. 2- there's no way to add more capacity to the battery without buying a new battery from eBay, which you will probably end up throwing away anyway.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I can't believe I went through 3 sets of batteries in a 2 month period. It was very frustrating. The second battery lasted maybe an hour tops. They were cheap but the second one I had would not hold any charge. They would eventually die, so you had to purchase a new one. I bought the Samsung so I would be protected and that is why I would not recommend this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a Dell Inspiron 7559 w/ i7 2.2Ghz, 8gb ram, Windows 7 64bit, Nvidia Geforce gt430. I've had the device for a while, it's been on 2 computers, one with Windows 8 and another with windows 7 and i7, on both the cpu and the ram run slower than they were when I first got it. I decided to upgrade to windows 7. I ran the upgrade through my windows 7 pc to make sure it would work, and it worked fine, so I went to upgrade windows 8 to 8.1, which did not work out, I ran another upgrade and it did not. It is very important to note that I had already downloaded Windows 7 on my new computer before I got the laptop, so there was no extra time to download the extra software for it. After spending hours trying to figure out what was wrong, and researching on the internet for the fix, I came across this site: http://windowsrepairguide.com/win8/what-should-i-do-about-windows-8-1-running-slow/ And figured out the fix!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am so frustrated with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus  . The first thing is, it only has one USB port.   This means that unless you are on a two USB cable plan, you are always plugging in USB peripherals   and you always have to use the included cable.  This cable has a tendency to slip off the phone, which is a big deal for me. Â If it slipped off when I was on the go, I would have to keep it with me. There is no case for this phone at all.  In the past few months, I've fallen and hurt myself while using it and it's a pretty painful thing to do when you're on the phone   with it   as it has no case.  You have to take it to a repair store, and that's about it.  I've had mine for about two years, and I'm still paying for the device  , even though I get free accessories every now and then (Bluetooth speakers, Bluetooth keyboards). I know the new generation of smartphones are supposed to be better and more durable, but this is a very cheap phone for such a poor build quality.  If you are really tired of having to use a two port cable, the Moto X (2nd gen) is better value for the money and it is much better built.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just purchased my first   new   camera  .   And it was a bad experience!   Â  The quality is terrible and it is very hard to use with an external   cable and USB cables.   The camera is   so light   it is easy to take pictures of the sky, but the   LCD screen is so bright and it takes pictures so   grainy that it has a weird effect on the color.  I cannot get it to take a picture at f/2.8 and I have to stop shooting to make it click.  Now, this is only a bad camera in the bad cameras category.  It is not the best   on the market   but it is not awful and it has not   disappointed me enough for me to return it.

However, you can still use the wireless connectivity.  I have no complaints about the product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â I bought the JVC HD-CJ6 as an alternative to the HD-DVD1B in my collection.   It's very nice, with a black-gray-and-white color scheme, a built-in player, a decent, cheap-looking remote, and a nice picture quality.  It is, however, very hard to use.  To use the remote, you press the buttons on the back side of the remote and then move the thumbstick across the screen of the player to select an item from the small display.  The buttons also aren't particularly sensitive to movement, so if you don't move the remote a lot, you will hit buttons you don''t want to hit.  I find it to be a little more difficult to use than the HDCJ-C9I which I'm not sure why.  In terms of sound quality, the JV-CDX6 isn't bad.  Its sound output is not as great as the HDV-B5's, but it isn't awful either.  There are a lot of tracks on the CD, so the quality varies a lot from track to track.  On some of the heavier songs, there are some very good and bad tracks in a row, so it's difficult to tell which is better.  A lot of the songs are just okay.  As you'd expect, the music is fairly repetitive and not very engaging.  This is the main problem with this player; the lack of variety in music.  Unfortunately, the player is so easy to use that most people will find it easy to get started.  Also, I was very disappointed that it doesn't support Dolby Digital 5.1.  What good is the Dolby-D surround system if the sound isn't any good in it? Â   I don't know what kind of a person would buy this player.  My first purchase was the HDJ-1B and I'm really glad I did.  For the price point, it was perfect, but not only is it really hard to operate (it's a black and gray color), the picture quality isn't all that great either. Â   This player is a little too expensive for its features. Â  At the very least, I wouldn't recommend buying this player unless you have some extra cash to spend.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     " I purchased the G3 series of digital piano keys for a computer I used to work on as a child. At that time, the digital piano was one of the best instruments ever made, but today, they're so primitive it's hard to believe they're still made! The keys are made from thin plastic, and the knobs are made out of cheap rubber that easily pops out of place and doesn't feel like you're getting good quality. The digital piano sounds awful! It's way too noisy and sounds like it's been made out from a cheap electronic toy. The keyboard has a lot of clicky noises that sound like the keyboard is clacking when the keys are down. I bought a cheaper keyboard with an integrated USB port that sounded much better. But if you're looking for a cheap way to make music, the G2 series is for you. The best thing about this keyboard is the "Guitar Tuner" - you plug it into your computer and you can tune your guitar just like you did back in the 60s when you were in grade school. The worst thing about the G-3 is that they don't make a good keyboard cover, so you have to buy a keyboard that has a metal cover. Otherwise, I really like the G1 and G2 digital pianos!" - Michael H.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    5.0 out of 5 stars   I have the following device: Samsung T3    The main problem I have with this product:  - If you have a small-medium smartphone, you may find that the screen is too small for reading emails and the like. If so, I would not recommend it. The reason is that it is difficult to use the phone without looking at the screen. With larger smartphones, it is much easier. If you find that you use your phone more than you have to for the sake of a little email reading, you might want to upgrade to a bigger phone. I am also concerned about the battery life on this device. I have been using this on a daily basis for the past two years, and have never had a need for it to go out of service, but the battery on this particular model has lasted me about two months now.   - I have also found it difficult to switch from my BlackBerry to this device with one hand.    4.9 out of 4 stars  A little too expensive for the features:  5 out of 6 stars  I've had my T3 for about a month and it's been perfect for me. It has great battery life, screen is pretty good for an IPS screen (not very bright, but it's good enough), and the camera is a fantastic performer for the price. The only thing I didn't like was the size. I thought it was going to be too big for my hand but it turns out it's a bit too small because of the buttons and the small size. In the future, I will definitely get a larger screen. The one thing I really liked about the device is the size and that I can easily carry it around. Also, the speaker is really good for the size, it sounds great. The interface is easy to navigate through and just as easy to read. This phone is the only one I've ever used that doesn't have any problem with the screen burning out or overheating. The display is also incredibly vibrant, if that's a good thing or a bad thing, I don't know. All in all, I'd give this a 4.5 out 6.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't even care to try again with this product. I have to give this a bad review.   Product Review: VivoTab 6   For a $200 price point, I expected a more complete experience.   This is a very good electronic device for the price point.  If I were paying $200 for a device, I would expect a better experience in that price range.  I do have to say that I am a big fan of the Vivotab, but I donÂ´t think it would be an expensive purchase for people who use laptops all the time.  My biggest complaint is with the backlighting of the display.  There isnÂ´t a lot of light output with the display and as a result, the display is not that great for reading on.  On the positive side, the battery life is great and the sound quality is good.  It also comes with an AC adapter, which is a must have item for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I was looking for a really good computer and this isn't it!   What do you get with this computer?   The computer is very very slow. When you go from one screen to the next, you have to wait forever for your screen to turn off and on again.   It has only 8gb of ram and it will not load any games at all. You have to make a new one just to play a game. You will have to change your computer every 2-3 years. The only thing i can say about this product is, you get what you pay for. It's not worth the $800 you spend for it.  (Posted on 1/8/2017)  Best computer ever! Review by David I purchased my K-1 after much deliberation.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the NEX-7 and it was a great choice as a camera/lens. It had everything I needed. It was great for taking photos, taking videos and taking a great snapshot. However, my only negative is that it's a huge pain to load, set up and use. The buttons on it are super finicky to use. I had to start using a tiny screw driver to get the little rubber buttons to work. I wish I'd known this before I purchased. Overall, I'll buy again if I need something like this again. But for a camera it isn't great. If I want a camera that's cheap and fast, I'd choose an Olympus OM-D (better all around, cheaper than the Fuji).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -  -  If you own an expensive electronic device, you should take a look at this.    I was very happy with the quality and functionality of my wireless headphones.  So I bought 2. Â I love the noise cancelling ability, the bass is very good, and there are no issues with quality/workmanship (aside from one that the instructions suggest I do not allow my laptop to touch the earbud at all).  When I tried the headphones in my ear, the noise cancellation and bass was not as good as when I placed them on my head with a pair of headphones that I had purchased years ago.  I returned the headphones after the first couple of weeks because the wires that connect them to my headphones (which are different sizes) made it difficult to plug them into my laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first impression of the T100 is one of sleekness and power, but the device was never going to be the sort of thing you'd want to have in your home. The sound quality was good, as one would expect from a speakerphone, but it really is best used on the go, and even then, it's still very, very loud.   It should be noted that the T200 is more powerful, though the T400 has a slightly better build quality (though not as stylish).   The T200's battery lasts about 8 hours of talk time, about the same as the T300's.  T100 speakerphone:  The T100's speakerphone is as good as anything else I've tried. I haven't had any trouble using it with the T-Mobile plan, and in general it is very, VERY loud. It does take a little getting used to as it is a bit like trying to make conversation with someone who just sits there with a microphone on their head. The T-Mobiles app lets you set up the speakerphone with a list of preset frequencies and stations for calling from T-Me, so you can get your caller through if you want to just call your brother. The speakerphone comes in three flavors: a digital preamp with a few different presets, a standard phono preamp, and a USB preamp. I chose the digital preamplifier because I just had it on hand, and because it's nice to have something so different that's still a T-MOBILE. You also get the Tango app for the TMobile version, which is a very cool music player.  To listen to the speakerphones I downloaded theÂ  T-Mo Music app Â for iOS and Android.  The app let me play a wide variety of music in my phone for listening, but I did find that my preamps just didn't work in most of the apps, so I found myself using the TMOBIBOARD app to load and configure the phono/digital preamps on the T103, which sounded great.  Â  Included accessories:  I like to think that T-Phones are a little bit of an accessory, but really it's just a stand for your phone. The stand itself is metal and has a little plastic handle. The buttons on the bottom of the phone are not as tactile as the buttons on most other T-Phone stands
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My first experience with this device was great - it's the only thing I've ever used for music that's consistently accurate. The problems were quickly noticed.   I can't quite recall the first time I played through a set of tracks from a USB drive (the same set I have on a daily basis) and this thing couldn't tell where the tracks were in relation to each other or the overall stereo field. It would get it wrong all the time. And if it didn't, I wasn't able to fix it. So a couple of times I just backed up the tracks onto another device. And after that it worked. The next two times I got it wrong. I'm not going to start using it again until it works again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the third e-cigarette that I've purchased over the past couple years. I've gotten very used to the vape experience over the last few years and this is no different.  I bought this because I saw many great reviews online and wanted a very affordable option.  First, the tank design and vapor quality are pretty good.  The tank is made out of stainless steel and measures 12mm in diameter (I like the fact that the 510 can be refilled from both sides to fit any 18650). The tank holds enough e-liquid to get you to a very easy to use level of vaporization.  There are 5 airflow holes that screw on to the base that are angled down which is a great feature for those of us with smaller heads.  On the top of the tank is a single button.  When the tank has a little water in it it will turn on and when it's empty the button will start to light up and turn off.  It's just an easy-to-use tank that won't get in the way of the enjoyment of the vape.  As far as the atomizer goes, the coil feels great.  While I wouldn't say it's the greatest atomizer in the world, it performs very well.  My favorite thing about this tank is that it has the option of a clear/blue or black drip tip.  All in all the tank performs well and is a good value.  In my opinion, I'd recommend this product for anyone on a budget.

I was pretty disappointed, too, as I thought that it would be better for it's small size and price tag. I do wish it was a little louder though. The only way I can use it is for my iPhone. I just don't have the cash to buy another.  I bought this keyboard back in 2012 and it's like using a new one. Everything works great and there's no bad or flaky keys. I also purchased the USB adapter for this keyboard but I haven't yet had it up and running with my iPad so I can't comment on that. The USB hub is a neat feature and I will be purchasing another when my MacBook Pro's USB port gets full.  in a box with a box. In a box, with all the accessories. And I have the most horrible cable company. What's with them? I'm not sure. So many cables, so many ports, so little price. This is one of those items that I can see myself being on the fence about, as my only real reason for buying it is that I know I won't be able to go back to any other keyboard. I will however definitely be replacing the current one, as the other one is simply so cheaply made that I will have to replace it after only a few months.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my first time to buy from this seller. But I was very happy with my purchases. The product was very nice. The only problem was, that a week after receiving my device, I found the unit dead in my bag. A replacement was very expensive for a brand new unit. After the replacement was provided, I received a notification of an issue with the unit. The replacement was a no-show which was unacceptable. I contacted ebay and the seller was unresponsive. After I returned the unit, it has been in the box for 2 weeks. It has been very inconvenient to keep up with this issue. I have also had issues in the past with the same seller having to send another unit when the first one went bad. I am very disappointed in this seller for not responding properly to my return request.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had several of these phones. There are not enough good reviews about this product. The phone is bad. The sound quality is awful and it only lasts 3 days. So if you are going to buy this phone I don't recommend it. I would recommend an older model and a better model.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The    mote I like is the battery,   but I am very disappointed by the   keyboard. The buttons do not do what I expect from a computer, the keys are small and not clicky enough. I bought it because it's "made in the USA", but the keyboard is made in Taiwan, so I can't get the warranty I want. Also, the case is cheaply made, it feels like they made it out of plastic and the light-up screen is kind of fussy. I can see why other people might love this   device, but I can not. I would recommend it, but you may as well go with a more reliable computer.  5/5 Good device, no issues Review by Chris I purchased this as a backup for my laptop.   Overall, it was a good decision. The USB port works great. I've even installed Windows 7 on this device and it is working perfectly. It comes with everything I need, a USB to power cable, case, and memory card. The only thing I wish was that it came with a keyboard.  -If your computer has a full sized keyboard, I would suggest using that as well as a mini.  "Good Value" Review by J.K. The best thing about this product is the keyboard, but the only issue with the keyboard was the tiny keys. They took a while to find the right key, but that is the only real issue. If you need a keyboard, it is worth spending the extra $10, but if you're just looking to add to your collection, you will be satisfied with this. I have not had any problems with any of the hardware. I like the case. I also like the power supply included with the device. You won't be disappointed with this purchase!  3.5/4 out of 5   Wish it came in a keyboard case Review by C.J. The screen was too small. It is only half an inch larger than my laptop and my finger does not go all the way around the screen. It works well in portrait but the video quality is not great. When in landscape mode, it would show an extra pixel at the top and bottom so if I looked at an image or text, it looked blurry. I had to get rid of the screen for a few weeks.  on the other hand, this is very portable and has lots of ports.  (The
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned a few of these devices and I've been pretty impressed with their performance and features. The one thing I don't like about these is that they are not very loud and they can be hard to use while driving.    Customer service is the best:  I really enjoyed buying these devices. They were delivered fast and in great condition. The customer service was wonderful. I called to make a refund, they sent me a replacement right away. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was a nice looking gadget.   I had it for about a week until it failed completely and the display went black and died. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had this for two years.   It has replaced the old keyboard, mouse, and speakers.  This is great, the mouse is amazing, especially in a portable device, but the sound is terrible. It's not a horrible sound. I use the volume control on the device to fix the sound when I hear it at a low volume.  It's a problem with all wireless mice that do not have volume controls.  I had bought the other model because I wanted a device that had wireless and a touchpad but I still prefer the old model because the touchpad works better than the mouse and has no issues with being loose.  If it was my only keyboard it would be perfect.  Overall it's a good device and I would recommend it.  But, I would still recommend the old one, it is still great for gaming, typing and having a keyboard, but a touch-pad would make it better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - When we first started using this device, we were a bit skeptical.   The price is low, but it's not like we could afford anything else.  The buttons feel cheap and don't register a "click".   When we tried using it as a remote control, it wouldn't work because we had it in the other room so we just tried it as the TV remote.  So, we gave it to our daughter to use as the video remote and I've been using it for the last few weeks.  We both love it and are very satisfied with the results. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received an iPhone 3GS with Touch ID for a birthday gift. It works fine. I really like it and do not have to use a passcode.   It's small enough to be tucked into my pocket.  There's also no need to pay $500 for a new phone when I can get an iPhone for like $200 and change the battery for like 50 dollars.  If you really want to own one of these phones, get an unlocked one.  The iPhone 4S is great but it's overpriced.  They should release a new iPhone this year that does a better job than the 4S but still costs $100 less. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The electronic device I have purchased recently is an Apple iPhone with a 1GB memory card that has worked flawlessly for about a month, but is now running on low battery.   I was expecting it to be good, but have been disappointed   This is a good computer but you will be very disappointed if you are looking for a powerful computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of my favorite things about the iPad is the amazing way it makes using my laptop and Mac a breeze.   It's very portable, easy to use, and the battery lasts forever.    But, the downside is that the iPad just won't charge as well as other devices, especially my iPad mini.  And the lack of power is annoying as I can't use it when I'm at a cafe with a few other people.  So, I don't recommend this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the X8 and used it for two months for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I must say its the best device I have ever used Ive had many other devices but none of them compare to this one    Excellent product for price I have two of the Xs. One on a computer and one on a tablet. I am glad that I have these in my bag. The Xs are much better than the G7.  I like the X9, the X10 and the X15.   But, I still have to be careful, because the X5X will cut off power when the keyboard is connected and also when the mouse is connected.  was there ever a X8 version? Or, the G6?  good good  Amazing!!! The first two, I used in a PC as a "note to self" machine, they worked great, but one of them would not connect to my new phone. The problem was solved by using a small dongle, but not before the battery had lost 20% capacity. I finally found the solution, with the help of a friend, with a special cable (I can't remember if it is a plug or a dongel) that connects to the USB socket in the back of the device.     I'm very pleased with this product, and hope to see other X products in the near future.  in case you need a replacement keyboard cable:   The cable is sold separately. To use the X6, just plug the cord into the back, then you can plug the keyboard in via the USB-A port. The cable is connected to the keyboard with two male connectors, one on the other end of the cable. It also has two other male connectors on the end, one for the mouse and one for USB-C, which connects to a USB port on the X7. If you only have one keyboard, you can just connect the keyboard via the usb-A connector on the back.  The cable should also work on the old G6, but I don't have that one yet.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â I used an Apple iphone 7 to replace a samsung iphones that I had had for years, and for the most part i was happy with my new phone.   The design of the iphon 7 is the same as the ifom 7 and the internals are very solid.  If it were possible ive wouldve bought one but in the end ive had this ipho for a couple years now and ive found ive gotten better reception and have gotten a few other little quirks   but that is a deal breaker   and the iax board looks like crap   the price   was a little high but im happy  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got my new computer, I thought it was great. Then a year in, I realized that I had been using the same one, and so I bought another computer for my other desktop. And this time, it was a very bad experience. There was no sound at all, it would freeze on me without giving me a chance to get it back on, and the screen had been cracked in half. So the last computer I had was the last one I'd like to buy, at this price range. Not to mention that it's the only computer I've had with all the bling on it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard on this is terrible. It's not a problem if you only have it for a short while because it has a very small footprint, but when I bought it in 2011, this was the standard, not the alternative. I got tired of it being the standard. It just is not a very good keyboard. It isn't a bad typing keyboard per se, but the keys are very small and difficult to press. I would rather not have to buy a new keyboard for my keyboard just because this one sucks. I will probably eventually get the HP Elite x3 (which has some of the best hardware) but I'm not going to spend $900 on the HP.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If your electronic device stops working because you accidentally left a note about a defect on it that was accidentally left on it, you are likely not only out of luck, but also out of pocket.   But you could try the following:  1. Make sure you're not using a device you bought on eBay or Craigslist.  2. Try to locate the device on which the note was left.  3. Put the note under a few blankets and store it somewhere safe.  4. Get a new device.  5. Check that the electronic device you just bought is a legitimate piece of technology.  6. Don't let your neighbor buy a second-hand electronic device from an ebay seller.  7. Buy a new electronic device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have purchased many of the low priced electronic devices in the past. This one is the worst of them all. The sound quality is so poor when connected to my stereo and it takes up too much space on my desktop. It will block all of the music on your stereo and you will hear the sound of the television and computer speakers in the background. The cord is long and not very flexible so it is hard to move around. I purchased a different one from another company but it is not as bad as this one.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Tammi from Not a big fan, just want a few more features I have only used this so far for one game on my laptop but I am not a big game player but I do want more options so it can connect to my tv. This works as described, but the sound quality does not look like the picture on the product. The picture is very good, but this is only my computer so I can't really comment on it on the tv but I will update this review if I can get a better picture. The good things: It is compact and lightweight, and easy to put away. The small size allows for the ability to have multiple cords in the same location. The only bad thing about this is that there is no wireless range so if you have an extension cord in the living room and then a television in the bedroom the connection will not work. Other than that, I am really enjoying playing this game!  5 out of, 5
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I bought this camera for a few reasons, but not all:  My dad wants to learn to shoot with it.  The camera's light is great.  It's a fun camera to play with and the price is great (a little expensive for an entry level camera).   (I love that it is a compact camera. )   I'm happy with this purchase, but I can not recommend the product unless the camera works on some newer versions of android or  Android 4.4  ( I'm looking at you android )
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device because I have a friend who suffers from chronic nausea. He was using an Iphone for about 5 years without any improvement. The idea of having it built into my e-cigs is great.   My e-cig has two buttons. One to charge, one to de-charge. The battery charges in about 10 min. The first thing you see when you power the device on is the green LED that turns green when a charge is detected. The green LED doesn't flash on and off. The only other indicator that there is a charge are the two indicator lights.  The other LED is used to turn the device off.  I tried using an old smartphone and it worked great. The problem I had is the battery would die within a few weeks of regular use.  On a positive note, it is a very small package that fits nicely in a purse or pocket.  My favorite feature is the ability to use the e-liquid refilling port in the box. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought an iStick 4 as a replacement for my iSticks 3 and 4 that I had for years.   The best thing about the iStik 4 was that it had a removable 510 connection that you can also use to convert it to a box mod.  The downside is that it is so large and bulky that when I got it home from the store it looked like a bomb.  I had to buy a 510 adapter because I didn't have one of my own.  And because it was so heavy, I couldn't use it on my lap.  After I got everything together I got a good battery life.  My iSticky 4 lasted all day and it only had 2 hours of charging.  But it did not get the job done on the side of my apartment balcony.  It could have been a great device but it was expensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a   3.3-Volt battery charger a few weeks ago, but I've found that the battery charge rate is a bit slow and the charging cable is not designed to accommodate larger batteries. So, I'm looking for a charger that can charge my 18-V battery up to 4.5-V. But with the charger charging slower, I've been getting a little nervous about how long it will take to charge my battery and how many charges I'm going to have left in it. And with the cable not being able to support larger batteries, I don't know how much longer I'll be able to get my battery charged up.    Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Value But the Charger is Too Long This charger has some great features for its price. The design is very easy to use, and it charges the 18650 batteries quickly. The charger itself does not support larger 18650s (if you buy it). It uses an odd pin that is too long for the USB port. You can see where the pin has to be cut off, as it's very difficult to remove the plug from the end of the cable. It also does not have a flat ground cable. This might be for aesthetics and nothing else, but a better ground is a must have if you are charging more than a few 18650 cells at a time. It has a long cable too that needs to be trimmed to fit in most USB charging port. I would recommend the charger but the cable could be shorter and the plug could be made to fit into the port on the charger more snugly.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i will not buy this product again.  i would give it zero stars if i could.  this product is not the answer for me    Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not good for the price I purchased this to replace an Apple iPad with an ipad mini. However, this iPad Mini has problems using Apple's iTunes, it does not play music or movies. My first thought was "no way can I upgrade" but after a few attempts, I am finally able to use iTunes to download media and iTunes 10. The only thing I don't like is that the iBook doesnt have a camera so it will take pictures with the ipad but this will not fit in my pocket. I was hoping to be able to upgrade to the larger screen iBook and a camera but alas...  Review of: Sony eReader Reader XS 10.5in - Black (Firmware Version: 0A16)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     A: Yes. The "A" ring is the negative, and the "B" ring that is attached to the metal housing on the device is the positive. When the battery is connected to the positive ring of the device, the positive will touch the battery, and thus turn the device on. When connected to negative, the battery will not touch the positive, and so the device will not turn on. The negative battery is not removable, so the battery has to be placed in a separate enclosure in order to be removed. To replace the negative battery, you have to first disconnect it from the rest of the circuit board. It is located to the right side of the phone's chassis, and it is fairly easy to access.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am not a newbie and am just getting back into wireless. I purchased the Nexus 5 last year for the camera (and the phone), but my wife and I wanted a tablet, so I purchased a Kindle Fire HDX which has served me well. Unfortunately, this device is not as good. I have had other devices that have been good, but have a very different feel. The phone works fine with a good battery life, and the screen is bright. My biggest complaint is the software. When you launch a program, you can't actually use it without using the on screen buttons to activate it. For example, it is hard to use the camera to take a picture (when the screen says it takes a picture) without using on screen keys. Also, when you use an app on a game to start the game you have to use on screen key to start it. I am sure some will complain about Android 6.0 and its various bugs. I just wish there was a fix for the lag on the Nexus 10 which causes me to constantly go back and forth between the on and off screen keys while I am using a game.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the first things I did was buy a new computer because the one I used for a month and a half got so old, I just didn't want to use it.   I had an old computer, my brother had a new one, but he was using it for his college courses (that's about all it could do, but I like the computer more than him). So I bought a new laptop, but it's a very, very old one. The battery went dead after only two months.  My girlfriend who had just got a tablet did pretty well with it, but she didn't have the same experience I did with the computer (she just needed a tablet for school).  So I wanted to use the computer for more than just college, so I bought an Apple Thunderbolt iMac and then an Apple Air. I like Apple a lot.  I got my Apple keyboard and a case for it. I have been having problems with the Apple keyboard's left button, and so I ordered an Apple Magic Mouse II (it was on sale, but that doesn't help) and I installed that on the computer.  When it came, I tried to use that and it started randomly getting very hot when I was using the mouse. I went back and got another one and tried it, and it got hot again, and then the computer wouldn't boot. I figured there was some problem with the keyboard I got, so now I'm waiting for a new Apple keyboard.  This time I got a new iMac, and I'm using that until I figure out what's wrong with it. But this time I'm pretty satisfied with my computer. I had to buy the case and it's an expensive one.  The iMac has a very nice keyboard, and the mouse's really cool.  They were on sale too, but still, I think I'll be looking at a Windows machine soon.  - Mike

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPad Pro   is the only thing that has improved over the last 6 months.   For the price, the keyboard is very comfortable to type on, but I am still looking for the "perfect" way to charge this device.  It is very nice to be able to charge it when it is not in use so that I can use it on the go. I think this would be a great purchase for a student/teacher in an urban setting who needs to be prepared for an assignment but doesn't want to be bothered with having to search for a charger on their phone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Puck from This is an exceptional product. I have an iphone and i can't wait for my tablet to come out. i am impressed with the fact that i can do so many things that an ipad cant do. I just bought the tablet on Saturday and the iPad mini was delivered the next day. I'm pretty happy with it so far and am excited to buy the other two. We have 2 iPads so for us, the iPad will be used primarily as a student work-station. It is lightweight, has touch screen and works very well as an editor and document reader. For the iPad Pro, I plan to use it for everything from drawing, to videos and web browsing. It has become a main part of our iPad use and we love it! I am excited for the other 3 to come in the mail. I've been very impressed with Amazon so far.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new iPhone 6s (and other iPhone devices) from Apple, and they gave me a free wireless keyboard, a free replacement back plate, and a free case to go with the phone.   It works great, but the new iPhone's screen is pretty terrible, as seen in the image above.  I have not seen much of the new "4-inch" display, but it is still a very clear display.  My original phone's screen looked better, but I like the new screen because it has a higher resolution.  For the price of the keyboard, which I had to buy, I have a good keyboard, case, and case back on my phone. But I wish they would make this keyboard for older phones, such as the iPhone 4, which was very cheap in 2006 or 2007.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a nice device but was poorly designed. First, I thought it would be better if it had more power than 10W, but that's what I get from most devices now, so it was fine. The screen was very small, too small, so the image on the screen didn't do it justice. The backlight could be better. The button didn't work right, so I had to unplug it to get back to the menu. And it was too small for the USB port, so every time I plugged in a USB device, it would make a big "whack" noise. I thought about returning it but I decided to let it go for now. I may buy a second one but probably not. Maybe it will be better than the previous model.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â The battery life of this thing is very poor for my needs, but then again, this thing has been used only for a month and it is getting on 10 years old.   If you have not had a good electronic device, I would recommend you look at a good quality   computer with USB ports, which may be a better investment of your   hard earned money.  The power cord is very long and bulky, but it does give the device an extra bit of battery life.  This one has never worked very well, however, so if you do get a spare one, make sure it has a good   power adapter or the battery will last very little.  If the battery does last the length of this battery, you have a good purchase.  I would have liked to see a USB port to recharge this thing, as a regular charger will not charge it sufficiently and you will be left with a dead battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I got a brand new one a few months ago. The speakers are a little harsh and the volume of the bass is so bad you have to crank the volume up to get anything going. I can still hear some volume on my computer but the sound is terrible. It's so bad that it's actually distracting from my computer use. I get distracted by this on my daily commutes and at work because of how terrible it is. My old one was terrible too.

Good screen resolution, battery life, keyboard layout and the keyboard is great. Battery is good, but not great.  is nice that you can use this Surface for work. The only downside is the wireless keyboard doesn't have a Bluetooth connector. Not sure if they will add it in a future model. Otherwise it's a solid product.  in the future I may consider an upgrade, but I like what I've got so far.    Cons: The charging cord needs to be changed every time you recharge, unless you have the USB adapter. Also, the keyboard connector is hard to connect because it's not flush with the chassis. The Surface Book charger also doesn't fit well with the connectors on the Surface 3, making it difficult to connect. If you do have the Surface charger with you, it can charge the Surface just fine.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You get the feeling that the people in the field just don't have a clue what's going on and I've never seen an electronic device so bad, so broken, so flimsy, so unusable! I've been using a cheap wireless keyboard and mouse from a different brand for the last few years, and I was a fan of it. Then I purchased the Kobo Aura H2O and was in heaven: it was so easy to set up and use and had a very bright display. Then, the next day, the mouse stopped working! I'm not even an advanced user of electronics and yet I have to write a review about what I would consider to be a really bad device. It's time for me to return it and invest in a different device.   I've had a couple of other Kobo models, but the H2o was the first that I thought would be a perfect fit for me. I love the simplicity of the H1o but hate the lack of keyboard keys on the H9. It has a tiny keyboard with no keys in the middle. I didn't get the H5 because it had the same flaw. If the H3o is even half as good as the H8 then I'm in for a big smile.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because I wanted to learn to use a laptop but was turned off by all the bad reviews. I bought one as a gift for a friend because she loves to play video games but can't do anything else at the moment because she's on her lunch break. When she got home I set it up and it didn't work. It's not the fault of the laptop, as it has the same chip that the rest of the company's products use and it just wasn't compatible. After several attempts to fix it I gave up, decided to throw it away and bought a new one with the intention of repairing it myself. It did work and now I feel much more confident that I can use a computer and am able to write a review. If you can read and follow some basic instructions on how to use your laptop, you can figure it out.   I purchased one of these to help out a friend of mine who couldn't be bothered to set up a laptop. She used it to play World of Warcraft and it worked for about a week.  After a week of being able to use her laptop, she took it back and I sent it back to her without a refund. I got a receipt and emailed her to tell her that if it wasn't fixed I would be returning it. She replied saying "you should have asked me what I wanted in the first place. I paid $300 for it" and that she didn't get a refund "since you're a scammer and it was so broken I didn't want to keep it."   A few days ago I got the email and sent her the receipt. She has been contacting me asking about it for about three days and has yet to contact me about it. I'm pretty sure she doesn't know how to setup the computer so we will have to try to fix the issue ourselves. I have my old laptop which I have used for about 2 years and have had no problems.  Review written by: julie bryan on May 17, 2011:  This laptop is perfect! If I have one gripe I would say it's the speakers. They are too quiet. Also the keyboard is a little weird. However, as I said before, it is a perfect machine and can do most anything you want it to do, including programming. I highly recommend it!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPhone is great for the most part, but it has problems. Some of these problems are hardware related, some are software related.   First, there are some very annoying design flaws. For example, a simple function to lock/unlock the screen in iOS 3.x will cause your device to repeatedly pop up an "invalid password" error message every time you try to use your iPhone. This is especially annoying when you're using multiple accounts. Â It was fixed in iOS 5, but the problem remains.  And to top it off, the iPhone is very expensive for the features it gives you.  The main reason the iPhone has gotten so popular is its excellent camera.  Now this can be very useful.  It is great at giving people a very high resolution photos.  Some of the cameras on the market like the Canon 5D mark IV are also good, but they cost a lot more.  But you pay a lot of money for a camera you can't use, and you're left with a camera that is worse than most other cameras you can get for the same amount of money.  This is a real problem with the iPhone.  Apple doesn't want you to be able to do high quality, high resolution shots on the iPhone because of its low cost.  Also, the 3.2 MP camera that comes on the base model iPhone 4S is inferior to the ones found in many other cameras like the Olympus E-P1.  I'm not saying that it's a bad camera, because it's not, but this is an area where Apple should really be making changes. The same goes for Apple Maps.  While the interface is quite good, it is just not the same as what you get on a high end camera. I've taken tons of pictures with both the iPhone and the Olympus PEN.  Google Maps and Google Earth both do a better job than Apple.  Most of the time, you'll want to buy an older model and use your old phone.  If you're on iOS 5 and don't have a 4S yet, buy a 64GB one, and get the cheapest one you can find.  Then you'll be able use the higher capacity models like the iPhone 4 (which you really should get anyway).   But if you do have the 4S, get a new 4S.  Even if you get the 4G model, your data usage will be quite high
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a well made, well built device. However, a problem that can arise is with batteries. I have had batteries die on me in this thing. The battery charging leads get bent (as in the one shown above) as the batteries heat up. They do not last forever but in a long run will likely die. For a light, not a big deal but it does show in a device you pay for.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a fantastic device!   I've been using it for about a week now and have really been enjoying it.   It is small, compact, light, and can easily be charged wirelessly.  My only complaint is that the cable is not fully detachable.  So be sure to use a thin extension cable or something if you can.  It has no buttons, only on/off on/on for the light and one LED, and the battery has to be used with a special power adaptor, but I've always had a hard time with those. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Posted by Chris at 4:29 PM I have just returned a Sony Vaio F-Series computer after purchasing it on eBay from a reseller who failed to provide a return receipt and a refund. The seller did attempt to resolve the problem by offering to return my money but I declined his offer and took it back to the store. There, I found the following terms and conditions were displayed on the front of the computer display.   This is the condition for return (refund) of your purchase from an eBay or other auction. 1. If the item arrives to you damaged, please take a picture of the item and send the pictures to us at: [email protected] 2. For the refund, you must send the defective item(s) back to: [address removed] 3. In the event the item(ies) returned to you is not damaged and you have purchased a refundable item from us, please send the original items to us to: ________________________________________ 4. We can only accept refunds for defective items. ______________________________________ I returned the computer and I can find nothing wrong with it. This would seem to be a common problem among other models, particularly those sold from China or India, but it seems to be more common in these older models than newer models. The reason I gave no credit for a good service? I had been paying $200+ for a computer with a defective display. When the seller failed to give a refund, I paid that $200 and now I have to find a new one. The best part of all, the seller refused to help with any warranty problem and I ended up having to buy a new computer from an established dealer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned these headphones for over a year and have been disappointed in the performance of the drivers for the most part. They have a very clear sound but sound harsh and have a "harsh" overall tone that seems to affect all other aspects of the sound including the low end. I have tried to fix this problem by swapping the drivers with an equalizer/amp that supposedly helps but I have not been able to improve the sound at all and it is becoming more and more evident that I will have to trade them out in the near future.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product and was very surprised. It was difficult to connect to my router and even tried changing a line to the computer with it, but no luck. This product is made in China. I have read many reviews about this product being of poor quality. In a world where technology is made cheaper and easier everyday, this product is of poor engineering and design.    Rated 4 out of 5 by Rj from Great for cheap. I use these in my garage as an easy way to connect my TV to the web. I purchased the HDMI to Component cables as I needed them, and as others have mentioned the cable seems to snap at the connector at the back of the unit which I can't see in the picture. The cable also has a loose end that was easy to break, and one of the plugs has a shorted end, again not a problem when using the included adapter. For $5 a pair it's a great deal for those needing a quick and cheap way to do this (or anything). If the cable has been made with better quality and the connectors are of a higher quality the price per unit would have been much higher.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The only problems I have is that when it is turned on, it runs like crap. It makes a popping sound with a constant buzzing noise as it charges (like a TV remote or some other type of TV remote). It also vibrates constantly, and when it stops vibrating the screen goes black for about 5 seconds. The only other thing I could mention is that my phone keeps going to sleep when it's connected to the laptop via USB cable, which is very annoying.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My first iPod was a cheap, ugly device. The battery died after a year or so, and it was a pain to repair. Now I have a nice new iPod Touch, but the music on it is horrible.   I've bought this for my husband, and I'm trying to sell it to him because I don't like it as much as I like my iPod 4s.  Rated 5 out of 5 by D from Works great I've been using it for a while now and it's still going strong! I love it! Very sturdy and it gets great battery life on a charge too.    Rated 4 out of the 5 by Anonymous from Works, but has issues I purchased this to use as my primary media player. I have had it for about a week now and so far it works well for music playback, but its battery life is just fine and its easy to take a break from it to recharge.   However, I do not like the fact that the micro usb is only compatible with Apple devices. While this does work on my Samsung S6 Edge, this also means that the bluetooth functionality does not work, which I do need to watch. However, it's really not an issue, it just means I have to keep checking my phone to see what music is playing.   of course this is just my opinion but still its a good product.  to my experience with this product is that it is pretty good and will serve me well until I replace my old iPod with a Samsung Galaxy S7 and my friends Samsung S7 Edge.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best keyboard I've ever used. I use a Razer BlackWidow Chroma. I can type at 120+ wpm. This keyboard is also a joy to use! I have had it for about a year now and it is still going strong. I've used this keyboard almost every day for 8 weeks straight and I love every aspect of it!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a bluetooth speaker a couple years ago. This bluetooth was so bad in its sound, that I stopped using it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you have ever used a calculator you know how frustrating it can be to do math, or to read a phonebook.   There are only so many different ways of entering numbers.  A good calculator has all the options you need.  One reason you need a good calculator is when you want to compute the answer to a math problem.  For example, if you are trying to figure out how many gallons of water are in a 10 gallon jug.  This is a very difficult question, but when you use a calculator, you can do the calculation just once and have the answer for the jug. For this problem you will use the formula: 1 qt (gal) x 10  It sounds complicated, but it is not.  There is a much easier way to solve this problem and here is how you can remember this simple equation: qt = qt x 10 g. So now that you know the basics about the calculator, let's see how to use it. 1) To add a number to a calculator.  To start typing in the question you will want to start with the number of gallons in the jug, followed by the number in gallons.  If you don't know the answer you can search for it in a phone book or the internet.  Type the answer in the calculator with the last number first.  You should end up with: 1 gallons  2) To subtract a number from a calculator number.  The same thing, except that the question is for how many litres of water in a jug, instead of the jug itself.  Follow the above steps for adding.  Again, type the number you want the answer of in the first column.  In the calculator type the minus sign, followed with the next number in the column. The total should look like: q.x.L x 10 L.  3) To multiply two numbers by the same decimal.  I hate adding and subtracting fractions, so I use the decimal.Â  To get a decimal multiply by the decimal number and use the result as the multiplier.  Using this calculator you will do the following. 1x2x10 = 20 1x5x10=150 1x1x10x5 = 50 1x4x10Â = 400 1x3x10.xÂ = 800
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â  I thought this was a great product and I just wish there was a more "user friendly" way to connect it to my iPhone.   It works well, but if you need to connect to a new iPhone every week you have to keep buying adapters to use it with the same device.  My guess is you don't need it for your iPhone, but it would have been great if I could have used it with my iPad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is a cheap cheap plastic case. This is a good case, but it is made out of plastic. The keyboard on this is horrible. No backlighting, and the keys are mushy. The mouse is a crappy looking mouse with tiny buttons and not a lot of clicky feel. I wouldn't recommend this case if you have to go through the hassle of putting in a USB drive or SD card to keep your data backed up. It will have your data all over the place. Also, it has a cheap metal stand so the case can be turned into a stand for your laptop. But I can live without that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A poor quality   Inexpensive   Noise in the noise cancelling   Easy to replace   Expensive   Ease of use (not intuitive)   Relatively low quality.   High price for a good device.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve from Good value and well made. I use this on my home theatre with two 4K screens and it is excellent for both use. It has worked for a long time, it is quite quiet and is easy to adjust. The only thing I don't like is the fact that it has an internal power supply which means you need to get a good wall adapter. It may be too small to run one or two of these with a separate power supply but I'd be happy with two (just be sure it's a good one - it'll need the extra amps). I use the BX7B for a small room (6 x 7ft) and it's perfect for the size, I just need to add some better speakers and this one will be ok.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received the K-Roku with a couple problems, the screen was not bright enough to read my e-mail quickly. I have a K-90 and this has about as good sound quality. But the interface is very awkward to use. I can use my mouse and a pen but sometimes the keypresses are not as smooth. This thing is heavy and has to be held down a good amount. But once it is held down it is pretty slick. There is a slight click when the remote is on the cord, but then the cord will cut off.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    How to use a flashlight:  (A flashlight's output is measured in lumens. Lumens are measured in the distance light can be seen from a given point at a distance of one foot.) 1/1000 =   1/100 =  1 /   0.03125   (0.0325 lumen) =  2.5 How many people are in the room?  Â 3.   2 How do you turn on a light switch?  2 out of 4 people could not get it to work. How long do they have to hold the light on the switch before it is off?  The light has to be on in order for it to come off. If you are holding the light for more than a couple of seconds, you are already shorting it. What's the difference between a "florescent" light and a "dimmable" light?  A dimmable light is a light that dims when the power goes out (or the power turns on) - this is the type that comes with most light bulbs and was designed to make it easier to use when the electricity was on.  A "flooded" light is another term for a dimm and is used in some LED lights that are commonly available.  Is it okay to use fluorescent bulbs on my computer?Â  Yes. The heat generated by a fluorescent light is much lower than an incandescent light and the heat is released at the same time as the light is being used.  Fluorescent lights are designed to be as efficient as possible, which means that they are not very effective for most computer use.  It is possible to use them, though, as long as the computer has an active cooling fan and is being operated in a room where the temperature is cool. Are there any other types of light bulbs available?Â  Not really.  LED lights have been around for some time and have the same problems as fluorescents.  I have heard of some LED light bulbs that use a more efficient method of producing light than a diodes and other manufacturers do have some other interesting bulbs that are similar. Does any light bulb contain mercury?  Yes.  The reason the light bulb in your computer does not contain mercury is because mercury can be released when the transformer of a fluorescent bulb becomes hot enough to start burning mercury vapor (electrolysis).Â  A
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This was a good product, but it was a bit on the pricey side, which I expected because I had used one of these a few years ago when my iPod was very new. I bought the model that is cheaper because I was just trying to get the unit to do the audio thing. Now that I have this unit and all the software and music I have, I would rather have spent that money on another iPod, which is the primary thing it is designed for. If you are a musician, especially an electronic one, it's a pretty good one. If I'm playing music, I don't even think about using my iPod with my iPhone, because there's no way it will sync up with my phone. This unit works great, and if you want to have a way to sync your iPod to your phone and the phone to your iPod, this is the way to go. My only issue is that after you get it set up, there's a lot of software to get installed. I thought, "I can do that myself."  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You are right in saying it doesn't work well on a home network.   If I wanted a home wireless router I would have bought a wireless router a long time ago.  However, I had a really great experience with this unit. I love the way it looks and works, and it is very easy to use.  The only problem I encountered was that the wifi signal on the unit was not as strong as I expected when I plugged it in.  I didn't know this until I was plugging it into my home network, and I'm glad I had bought a different model.

If they would make an adaptor, that would be great. Also I've had to deal with a company before who has bad quality and customer service.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great little wireless headphone. I have two of them: one is a cheap one and one is expensive one. Both work great! I have one that's just plain cheap and another that is very expensive. These are not only a great wireless headset, they are very comfortable to wear.   I love this headphone    Awesome!   The sound quality of the JAM is amazing. The battery lasts for a really long time. The only issue I had is that I needed to swap out the wires to get the earbuds to fit (for those that have a really small head).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I bought these with my dad and he really liked them. He just told me that they would be great if they had a battery life indicator on them so I will try that next. I also really don't like the fact that they have no real protection against water or water damage. That's why I've read so much about these. I wish they had been a bit more durable, but other than that I really do like them.  The first two devices are great. They are very simple and easy to use. The battery life is okay but I will not be buying the next version because of this. I'll wait to try the next generation.  for the next gen. it will be really important to make them better. The current version (6.2.1) is not good for everyday use. I find myself going to the store to use my phone when I don't need it. It is very difficult to charge. Also, you have to keep the charging cord on all the time because the device just won't work without it. , I am happy to report that this version of the 6.2 is very good. I love the ease of use. It has good battery life and you don't have to charge the device often because it lasts all day. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good device that doesn't cost a lot of money. The only complaint I have about this product is the charging indicator on the battery icon doesn't work. It's very difficult and annoying to make the icon change to blue when charging is finished.  with the next model, please make the indicator work properly, this is very important to me. I like the simplicity of these devices. I don's a lot about this line of products and hope the next models work properly. I'm sure they will because they are made by a well known manufacturer.

If I can get the battery up to 80%, then I have a device that I can charge, read, watch movies and anything else I want. The one drawback is that there is no touch screen, but other than that it's a good device. The speakers are decent, but the quality does not match the specifications of the device. There are other cheaper tablets that are also good, but for $100 more than this one, I'd expect better. Pros. - Good battery. - Easy to install. Cons. - The screen is awful. I would rather spend $40 more for an  In the past, I've tried the Motorola Turbo, the Asus Eee Pad Transformer, the ASUS P4, the Kindle Fire HDX, the LG Nexus 5X, and even the new Amazon Fire. In each of those instances, I found that one or more of these devices were inferior to this, because they were either too heavy, too expensive, or did not offer enough of a screen. In addition, the Samsung tablet is by far the lightest and best performing of the four that I tried, which means that it can get away with the cheaper battery and not have to compromise on performance. Pros.- Awesome battery life. Cons.- Heavy and ugly, but in my opinion better than the others.- Decent display.- Only one speaker. Cons- Lack of a stylus or some other means of making sketches, but that is what tablets are for!- Touch screen is terrible.- Has to be placed right next to the computer.  Excellent Value for a Tablet I have owned my S8 since launch and now have a new Samsung Tab Pro 10.1 in the house. I'm running Windows 10 on the 10.0.10586 version of the tablet (

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just purchased a very expensive new car from a manufacturer. The car was very clean in most respects, and had only been driven 30 miles. I was very impressed with the car in many ways. The ignition key worked well and the steering was very smooth. I had purchased a brand new car a few years ago from another manufacturer and it was a pain in the neck and the car was never this good! The car runs very well. It seems to be quite a bit lighter than my last car. I am hoping the price of the new car was about what I paid for the car I just bought.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (no pictures please)   I was very disappointed in this item. After using it for about a week I noticed the screen had foggy looking pictures, and the video quality was terrible. The back light is so dim, it is almost useless to see anything on the screen when you turn it on. It took about a month for this unit to finally get fixed by a local store and the problem is not fixed any more. I bought it to replace an older model that I had that was defective and I got that unit 2 months after I bought this one. It has many more features than the original model and has much better video quality than the one I had for a year before. I am a tech geek and this unit does not do what I need it to do.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If I were to write a negative about my experience, I would say the user interface was awful and very unresponsive. The software and apps for the devices were easy to figure out, but not at all intuitive. I think my biggest issue was being a very heavy-handed user, which ended up being a waste of time and frustration as everything was either too hard or too simple for my needs.  No problems found:  Â    It was a fun toy and I enjoyed all the accessories included. I would not purchase again, however, because I found the process to be somewhat clunky. I've read reviews from others that said it's more complicated than other toys, so I was skeptical.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This item is really not worth your time, unless you have a real need for a large touch screen to play games and other applications. I was hoping to get this to replace a large LCD screen that I can't afford to replace and that I don't want to risk damaging, so I can use my PC as a TV, and I have the original monitor for that purpose. This monitor did not work out the way I wanted it to. I have used this monitor as a tablet display on my laptop for a little while now, and it worked fine. Now, it is displaying a picture on a tiny touch screen and I can hardly tell the difference between it and the LCD monitor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In my opinion, I bought a cheap Apple laptop and the screen turned off and the keyboard didn't work.   I contacted Apple and they said that it had to be done through the factory. I returned it.  Then I found that someone else had also purchased the same brand new laptop from Apple and that he found the same problem.  It's been 4 days now and I have had to contact Apple again to get a refund.  In the mean time, I have found another brand new Macbook.  I am going to contact Amazon and buy a new one that has a hard drive instead of the one that is damaged.  That has already been tried, and it didn't help.  This is why I won't buy anything from Apple anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The battery is pretty much dead. The button doesn't work. The sound is terrible. The screen is so small and dark. The thing has no value. I'm going to end this review with: if you want a good electronic device and not a big deal, I don't recommend the Galaxy S. I don?t know what happened to them.  Rated 4 out of 5 by L from Great phone with some flaws I bought this for my daughter for a birthday gift and she loved it. The battery lasts a good 7 hours on high brightness, but she likes to use it in low light and it goes dead in less than an hour. I think Samsung may have gotten a little carried away with the Galaxy Note 4's amazing display. It would be cool if Samsung would have gotten the resolution right. The phone is not very responsive at all. The keyboard has some quirks, and the volume buttons are really mushy. My daughter has the Note 4, which is pretty nice, but I think that the Note 3 would have been better. I can only hope Samsung brings a better display with the Note 5 so I can get a nice one that will last long. I also don't like the way that the device is designed for people who are looking for a device that doesn't need a case to hold it. .  a pretty good phone. it does take a lot of work to change the settings but once you get it all working well the phone does its job very well. this phone is great for the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For the most part, these speakers work well. They're not bad. They have the same flaws I have with some other speakers, but they do work. I would recommend them to people who are willing to invest in a speaker and to people looking for a good one for a reasonable price.  Rated 1 out of 5 by MarkS from Disappointed - Disappointed I spent almost $300 dollars on this pair. I got these to replace a pair of speakers that are 30+ years old and are now a complete pain in my ear. I purchased these to play some music. I plugged them in and left the speakers on. I was expecting them to work, but when I played them for the first time I realized they did not sound as advertised. I then had to put the speakers back in the box, put them back in a few days later and played them again and again and the same thing happened. I am now looking at replacing these speakers with some I just picked up. If I am paying this much for speakers and the only thing that sounds the same is the price, I may have a problem with my purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this after much deliberation on a whim while on vacation to the Bahamas. The device seemed well made to me. I bought it from B&H and received it the next day. The shipping was fast and the device worked fine. The problem came about after the first few days of use. I plugged in my USB cable and everything worked fine, except for the device's USB port being dead. I checked the device, and it worked fine on my Mac computer and my iPad. A few days after that the device started acting up. It would not charge or sync. It was a really small battery, I believe 2200 mAh. It turned off when I didn't push the power button, but it would not turn back on. I sent it back and got a replacement.   The device was replaced. I returned it to B&h and received a new one. I put it in again and it works fine now. I have owned two of these and I'm happy to have a backup charger in case of any problems. The only thing I would change would be to get a better cable and battery holder. It seems like a small thing, but I know I'm paying $12 for a small rechargeable device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The e-ink display is very clear and vibrant. I like the way that they display data on the display; they do not show all of the colors. The back light is very bright, but it is hard to tell if I am typing or not as the back light shines down on my keyboard. There is no wireless connectivity, so it is very frustrating to have to take your e-reader in and out of the case every time you want to use it. I love using my iPad as a portable book reader for quick readings, but e-books on my iPad are so much better than books on my e-book reader (Kindle).

The new boxes will never be able to play anything from iTunes or other DVD's, even if the DVD was rented from the cloud.  It won't work with any other streaming services and will only work if you connect directly to a computer using a USB cable.  Also, you can't charge a phone via the device, even using an adapter   Finally, all those great features that Apple was showing off a couple of years ago are nowhere to be found   So, if you already own an AppleTV, then this is a bad purchase   If you have been waiting to upgrade from the AppleTV 3 to something with some more features, but didn't want to spend a lot more money, then you would be better off buying the Apple TV 4.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Good battery life - 6/10 The battery life of the Note 7 is only slightly better than the Note 5's. The Note 7 lasts for about 3-4 hours on a single charge, with the screen on, but the Note 6 lasts for closer to 5 hours with a fully charged battery. I wouldn't call that stellar, but it's good enough for me to go through an entire workday with the Note's screen set to brightness maxed and not worry about running out of power. The other main gripe about the Note is that it isn't removable.  This is definitely not a tablet that I would recommend to anyone. This is a phone. The lack of a stylus is a little bit annoying, as well as the fact that the phone is so big, but overall, I'd say this is one of the best looking phones I have ever seen in my life.

It would not stay on or be bright after a few minutes of use.  There are no buttons or knobs.  I was very disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When the price is right, I highly recommend the iZotope RX software (with the RX plugin ).   After the fact, I found the RX software to be a poor choice.   One of the problems I have with the software is that it is very hard to make a perfect recording without editing.  In order to correct that problem, I would suggest adding the "No-Reverb" option to the RX.  There are many other settings that you can tweak in the RX that I find useful.  I find the RX to be very accurate and consistent.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My device is a very good one but I got this because of the features I need. It is just a very weak little piece of junk, I was forced to pay more for it then the phone for the same price that it has more features and more memory. I bought it because I want to take pictures of my home but I have a lot of photos on my phone. I do not need it for that reason. I will be buying the latest and greatest version of the camera from apple to replace this one because it is a poor device in my opinion. I would not buy it again.

We went through 20 to 30 gigabytes of photos, and the memory only went up to 20gb in storage. So you'll have a hard time downloading pictures from your phone to your computer, if you ever have to. If your not using any apps, it's super easy to make a backup of all your photos in a couple of minutes.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned the Samsung Galaxy Note and I've really been liking it. However, I found that the Note 7 battery issue was one that I didn't think I'd get to have to deal with. I am a very tech savvy person, and I was a little bummed when I noticed the battery was going bad. But this time it got me. When I finally did have to replace the battery, it came with a piece of plastic. I thought it was a very poor idea to use this plastic for a battery because of the scratches, and the fact that I was replacing a battery with a battery that I know is still going to die is beyond me. I don't even know if it will work with my iPhone 6, so I'm basically just giving up on this phone. I'd definitely recommend a separate battery if you use a Samsung phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I received the device, I was very excited. The screen was so nice and easy to use. However, I am just a beginner when it comes to electronics. Everything that I did with the device would not work. I tried the hard drive, bluetooth, and the audio jack. The Bluetooth would not connect, the hard drives would not show up in my computer, and I could not connect the audio through a USB device. I have contacted them, and they have not responded. They have given me a refund. It is not their fault, but I will not be buying a new one. I will just keep using my old one.  Great product and great service!   It works as advertised! The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that the instructions for connecting it to the PC are a bit confusing. It's not that hard to connect it to a computer either! Overall I would recommend this product and would use it again!  Nice computer!  This has a great built-in speaker, and an awesome touch-screen. It also has a very nice USB port for charging.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device is the best electronic device I have ever owned. I have had an iPhone 3 and 4 for about 3 years.   It is really amazing the way the battery lasts and the ease with which you switch from the phone to your computer. I've been a Mac user for 15 years and am happy to no longer have to deal with the lag and battery drain associated with my phone. This was the first computer I ever had, and I was so excited to finally have a computer with which to do my job. I also had a small TV and this has made it so much easier. The screen is good, bright, and easy to see. The processor is great and will not die easily.  I was also able to purchase an external hard drive for about a dollar.  This is a perfect device for someone who is constantly working on their computer and also for those who like a little more versatility when it comes to their computers.   " I purchased this item for my daughter as she's going to be getting into the gaming world and needs a reliable and fast internet connection. The connection speed is fast and the device has a lot of features for people like her. It is definitely a quality product, but it does not meet my expectations. There's way too much to do on a phone, and then the internet connection has to be fast, so I can download stuff and still have the battery to last a good 2 days. If your trying to play online with another computer/pc, the connection is very slow and not very stable. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I love the games, but I wish that there was an internet explorer to do things on the computer like look at documents, etc. Otherwise I'm happy with my purchase. I love my daughter and she will definitely be using this again. The gaming and gaming-related stuff is not the only thing she uses the computer for, so i do like the gaming aspect of it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If I could give a 9/10 it would be the best product I have ever purchased!   The screen is beautiful, but not for everyone. If you're looking to have the highest resolution screen and then have the quality of a 1080p phone, this is what you're getting, and at the price it is a great deal.   When you need to do some touch screen operations and the screen turns on, I'm so thankful! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A good review of the device: I purchased the device over a year ago and have since used it in a variety of scenarios, which has led to it being a good value.   It is relatively small and light, the only negative I can find is the fact it's difficult to use with a Bluetooth keyboard.  It also uses a standard headphone jack, so not as versatile as a bluetooth headset, or a 3.5mm dongle.  A bad review of a good electronic device :   The speaker is good, however the sound from the device is very muffled.  The light is pretty bright and you can see it very well out of the dark.  I have found myself using the device primarily for my computer, which I find quite useful in a few different situations.  Overall, I am pleased with the device and it has been very handy for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This review is of a bad e-Reader. I had the good fortune of getting a pre-owned, refurbished copy of the book from my local library. There were a number of problems from the beginning, the first one was that the book refused to work, which caused me to take the book off the shelf and toss it in a waste bin. Another problem is that when I tried to open it with my finger (as there is no stylus) the cover separated. I have seen the cover of the other books that are not e-books and it does not happen in the same way, it has been on the shelf for several days. I will never buy an e-reader again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What a horrible gadget that will never work. The only way I will buy this is for my wife. The USB cord is too short to be able to hook it up to her laptop. My wife has a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 , and she didn't need a gadget that required the USB port. I wish they would have made the USB cord longer so it would have held up better on the back of my wife's laptop. I was going to give it 3 stars, but because of the negative reviews it will have to be rated 2 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This monitor has been discontinued in the US and no longer available on the online retailers.  It has some nice features such as 3-pin digital connectors but the monitor is way too bright.  This is the reason that I decided to sell this as it's just too bright to even use.  You can't have a bright monitor without some compromises and the M42 has none.  The M42 is also a very heavy monitor at 4.5lbs.  However, it has a very fast response time and has very nice color reproduction.  I like that there are 6-pin inputs to plug in other accessories such as a PC, printer, etc.    Read more...

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (3 / 5 ) I've heard of this model before but I just bought one and... it works! However, there's still lots of power draw on this thing! The other two laptops I've seen, like this one, seem to be just fine (if you use the mouse, I think it should be fine, too). Overall, this is good if you need to move around at the office.    Product Review: M.A.C.S.  by Matthew from New York on 3/13/2017  I bought this because I wanted a keyboard that would give me a little extra space between my fingers. That is exactly what I got, and I'm pretty happy with it. I only have one complaint, and that is the number pad. It's very easy to get used to the way it feels. The only downside is the price. I was really hoping this would be a good value. It isn't, but then again that's how I see this keyboard: the price is high, but it's worth it in the end!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a Samsung Smart TV and a set of Vizio E Series soundbars and the picture quality was horrible.I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and a Vizio P Series soundbar, they are great. I can watch the movies with high definition and they sound fantastic. I was using the S3 until I noticed this was the Vizio's fault, but I've heard some people say they're just ok but you need to adjust the volume up a little. The picture on the TV was very low contrast. When you move it around, you get a very pale picture. The soundbar didn't do much better, its a little low and you get lots of background noise. Not sure if it's a software issue or a hardware issue. I would not recommend using these soundbars.   (Posted on 4/15/2015)  Great Value and High Quality!! Review by Joe Quality Value Price Service The TV is very good looking, great colors, and the sound is very clear. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the remote control for the TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For one reason or another I did not like the watch. When I first got it, it seemed like it was a good deal, but when I got to work, it would not turn on. I tried everything from a different socket to a different charger to a new battery, but nothing worked. I contacted Zappos and they said they couldn't help me. I have been back and forth with Amazon trying to get them to replace the watch and it has never worked. Zappo will replace the charger but I was told I need to bring it to them to have the watch re-verified. I finally got an e-mail from a guy named Jeff who is a representative from Zappostop (yes, that is how Zappocaster is spelled). I sent him the e-mails I received from Zappa's company and he told me he is working on the problem.   I would have no problem paying $99 for a watch if it were actually reliable. But it seems as though it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The quality is good. The only reason I got it was so I could watch my kids grow older (and in my case get to have kids of my own) and that works. It is small enough to be a toy as well as a device for those with limited mobility. I use it at my work, so the weight is definitely an issue but for it to be small it has to have a good grip, as the weight of a typical work computer isn't great for those on the move.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:       A good way to go is to simply put all your devices in a drawer in a locked room or in a garage.   One of the first electronic devices to get an electronic lock and a deadbolt is the digital camera.  A few years ago we got our first digital camera, a Nikon D40.  At the time I thought that digital cameras were the future of cameras.  But after a while they started to slow down.  We switched to digital camera (Nikkor) that I purchased used.  I had purchased a new Nikon D1x lens and had put it all into the Nikon D20 (I still own that)  But I am in love with the Nikon Nikon D4.  The D4 is a true professional camera. I bought a Nikon 24mm  at an auction.  It is a professional zoom lens and for less than $1,000.  And it is just what I was looking for for an entry level DSLR.  This is a good DSLR for a small amount of money. Â I can get a decent picture in good lighting or even in low light.  So why buy a D4?  I just have to say I love this lens.  To use this lens on my D40 took all the fun out of the camera. The only real problems I have with this camera are:  1. the lack of a dedicated AF (AF-C is great) and 2. it can only do 6fps and I really wanted to try 12fps (I am really curious to try and shoot in 4K!)  3. The shutter lag and lag between the image being taken and the image having been sent to the PC and back to the D4 (not as bad as the D5)   The Nikon D3s is another great all around camera. 1. It has a built in viewfinder. 2.  Its small and light. 3. I really like that the camera can record video.  There are more expensive cameras out there for video but the Nikon is really a great entry level video camera. You can use any digital camera or lens that is compatible with your digital camera and the Nikon comes with a great lens and a good memory card.  The Nikon D100 is an all-in-one camera with a built-in flash. It is very compact and light weight.  One really good feature is the ability to attach a
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Sony XBR-650 with a 16x5.6 widescreen LCD screen on the Sony Vaio Vibe Z. It is a very good laptop. My first thought when I opened it up was how light and easy to carry this thing is. The display is good, but it is too small to see text clearly and the viewing angle is not very good. I wish I could have gotten a larger screen for a larger price. It does a lot of everything you want it to do and I am happy with it. The only thing that would make it better would be if there were a way to get rid of the crappy keyboard. The screen is a lot easier to type on than a laptop keyboard is. It's also a little smaller than a regular laptop which would be nice if you do a lot on your computer. I was able to get it to work flawlessly with Windows and Adobe Creative Suite. It didn't make much sense that the batteries for the LCD screen are not rechargeable. I just took them out and put in a new battery with a usb cord. When I took them back out they were still at about a quarter of their full charge. I have a Sony Vaia TV for watching movies but it's a little bigger and heavier than the Vaio. So this is not a laptop to bring with you if you have an actual laptop. It works pretty good as a travel computer, but its not quite ideal.  It will work for a few weeks on a charge, but your battery is probably going to die after about a month, just from being so light and thin.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     If there is one thing I love in my life, it is being a woman.   It is so much fun to be in my bra and have all of the manly men take notice of me. I can take a shower and have it be a breeze. It's so great to know that I can run to the corner store and get a cup of coffee without having to hide under my desk.  This is the best purchase I have made in a long time. The bra is comfortable, fits me right, and fits a good shape.  I also enjoy the added support, and I love how the straps are molded to the shape of your breasts.  Overall a great purchase. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got it I was not happy with the performance of the speaker; it sounded distorted and it was way louder than any other electronic device. It also is noisy. I am going to return it for another, but it is too expensive to return now.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â   Â I love the sound on the K-80, it is simply great.   And the software is awesome.  The K-50 is the worst in my books.  It has horrible bass which is why I only bought it because the price was right. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm trying to work on my audio. When I received this device, I was very excited about it, because I've always had trouble getting good sound from my laptop speakers. I'm having trouble with it too, but I don't know why. When it goes into standby, it plays music. But when it's in use, the volume control is just a button, with no volume indicator. (I can't remember the name of it)   It only has one input and output jack, but the mic on it is a very strange device, and it doesn't really work that well.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (I used a Bose QuietComfort 35. It is an excellent product. But I would not recommend it for an under 40 year old, because the bass is too low and the volume is too much. Also, the touch screen is not as nice as the other models, but you have to pay to play with the fancy buttons on the bottom. I am not a fan of the "free" batteries on the model and I found that they would only last a day or so. I like the bass and a bit of extra bass, but I don't get the "sound" that a bass can produce. That said, I still recommend it as a great device for younger people with less money than $1000.Â    This is a good device for music and podcasts; it doesn't produce as much bass as a headphone, but it is just right for my needs.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered two of these, one for me and one for a friend. We both were not satisfied with the quality of the product we received. The original purchase of the EH-800 model was a dud and we were not really looking forward to a replacement.   We ordered these devices and they came in about 6-8 weeks, the first one arrived in about 3 weeks.  The first one we received was defective and came with a warning sticker that the battery may not hold a charge because the button was pressed, so we returned it and received a replacement and they were great.  After that, the unit stopped working and the warning sticker said it would not hold up to a 3-4 week charge. The replacement we received had a completely different button and it held a 3 to 4 week charge but was still very weak. It is not a very good product and I don't think it should be on sale. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "The screen is very bright, as is the brightness on all my other devices. But the brightness is only just the right amount. The color is great too, I love this screen! No complaints there. My one complaint is with the backlit keypad. The backlight is very dim. You have to turn the brightness way down to see the characters, or you can read letters so much easier without having to look at the backlight. And the backlights is still not bright enough to be used as a typing keyboard. I have an electric typewriter, and for it to have keys that can only be hit with the lights turned up is a problem. And you have to be careful about how you're typing as you will only hit the keys which have lights. That's annoying when I have to hit the upper right corner to get to the letters. The keys are also a little too tight for my tastes, they don't click as well as they should, as it's not a mechanical keyboard but something else. I also wish that the space bar did not have a little spring on it, because when I hit it it makes a little clicking noise. That makes it harder to type. Also, the keys don't spring open. It has a small hole on the top which is where the keys are. It's just too hard to have the keys close up and then spring open to show the letters on the screen. So if you're looking for a good keyboard, but want it to be a mechanical one, this isn't the one for you."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've used this device for about a week now, and can really see a big improvement from the old one (no power on when plugged in). I've had it for about 8 months now, so I'm not sure how the warranty is, but I've always got it to work on at least a few computers, and it's always worked for me. The main issue I've encountered is how much power it consumes (over the course of a day, it consumes about 90 watts). I thought the power consumption was related to the CPU, but it's a different problem. It's the same as the old model: If you plug it in and put it in sleep mode, it will take a long time to power it back up. However, if you plug the charger in and let it charge for 10-15 minutes, it works like a charm! There's also a problem with the AC adapter (I don't know how it works with the other one) that causes the screen to go black on the AC outlet. It happens on both sides of the screen (on the top and the bottom) and has been going for over a month now. I haven't yet had an issue with it charging the battery, and I've never had any other issue that caused it to fail. I also think it's worth noting that when the screen goes black and there's no power, the display stays black too (for about 2 seconds). I'm wondering if this would affect the battery life, but since I don't keep it on the table to charge it, I'm pretty sure it's not an issue. Overall I'm very happy with this product!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from I wish it would last longer The new one lasted for a week in my house. I plugged the AC into the wall and left it on. I have two older computers and I needed to buy this one to power them all. It is extremely durable.  From the review at the following link: The device is well built and features are a plus. The display is bright and easy to read. It does get hot when the power is in use. The battery life is not very long, however. I'm hoping the battery lasts longer. - - -  Please don't buy this device if you are a computer user.   -  If you have any questions about the above, or want an opinion or suggestion, please contact me via

I have the bluetooth on it, so no need for the speaker either.   Very simple design but it still works and does it's job.  When the blu rays do not work in the remote, I use the TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    We bought this because it looked like the "slim" version of a USB cord. The cord is thin. The USB plug is narrow and not the standard 2.5mm type (which is standard in most consumer electronics and computer accessories). The cord can be easily broken if dropped or pulled too hard. You will need to be careful when plugging in or plugging out the cord. We tried to plug it into an older computer that wasn't going to work and this cord came with the computer, no problem. This cord works perfectly fine on a computer but not on the old computer that didn't work (and which didn't even have a USB port). We were going to get the slim USB cord, but didn't want to pay for a cord that looks like it's made for a computer that doesn't work. We think the product looks good, but it didn't meet our needs for the money.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It takes a while to set up and the screen can be hard to read. The Bluetooth is very slow to connect to my phone and even worse the audio doesn't seem to work. Not for someone with a bad back.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from Excellent product for the price. The sound is just as great as my HDTV. The price is great, and it works fine. I also like the fact that it has both speakers and a microphone so I can listen to music. Also, the screen is a little low for my tastes, but I'm willing to sacrifice a little accuracy in this case. I have a very cheap set up now and it's getting to the point that I can't handle it anymore. I'm now looking for something better. The only problem is the screen. That's just me though, I'm used to higher quality. A very good device for the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPhone 6s Plus is the best iPhone in years and I am really happy with it.   I have no idea how Apple can make the battery last a full day of heavy use without breaking down and I cannot believe Apple is doing a good job with the battery replacement problem.  It's time for Apple to make a battery that lasts longer than a few days of heavy usage.  I had a problem with my original battery.  A new one has the same problem. I have had a few iPhone problems and they all seem to be with the screen.  The screen on the 6s is wonderful but it will turn on but stay off every night.  At 3AM when the lights go out in the house I can easily wake my iPhone and get to work but when I come home at 4AM it takes more than an hour to charge my battery. The screen is very nice but it doesn't last long with the amount of usage I put on it. I really like the camera on this phone but it's just not up to par with the other competitors in a lot of areas.  This is my second iPhone and the battery is still being replaced.  In my opinion the iPhone 6 is an amazing phone but if they can get a battery replacement replacement issue solved in a matter of a few weeks than the iPhone is a lot better and this battery replacement issue could be solved in less than a year!  As much as I enjoy the new iOS 10, I'm still really disappointed by how buggy the camera is.  iOS 10 isn't even out yet and the camera crashes at every turn.  There's no easy way to get a video or photo from a photo album.  Apple has made a bunch of updates over the past year to make the camera better but so far it hasn't.  If you own a 6 or 6 Plus then you will find that you have an incredible camera but the new iPhone 6 doesn't match the rest of the phones in terms of quality.  I also really like all of the new features. I love how my photos look with iOS 10 on them and iOS 10 keeps improving every week.  But so far, the camera really struggles. I know that I'm not the only one with this issue. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      1. I have the X5, I'm not even sure what's wrong with it... it's really slow, and the screen seems to be in a bad way! it's not a good experience!   2. I bought a Nexus 7 on sale, and was so excited to play with it! I've had my tablet for a couple months now, and have tried a number of games. It just takes so long to load. And even if it's there, you can't get to it until you launch the app (which requires a lot of tapping).   3. It doesn't have any sort of touch screen; the screen just kind of comes out of the top of the tablet. You basically press the screen (or the touch button) and you have to use a finger to rotate it around. It makes it impossible to actually use it for games.   4. The biggest problem with it is the heat! I have a heat-proof case (made of some other material, that you would have to heat to get the screen to pop back out) for my laptop (and a keyboard too). The Nexus 7 just runs at 90-95 degrees all day. If it was just a touch screen, it wouldn't be a problem, but the heat can really ruin your enjoyment.  ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Samsung Galaxy S3, and was quite happy with it. Then the battery started dying very quickly and was never able to fully charge. I then purchased a Samsung Tab 3 8.0 and a Google Nexus 7. These were also excellent devices, but now the battery has died on both. I have had to replace both twice because of the battery, and this has not been an issue with my Nexus 7 which is only a couple years old.   The LG G2   is not a very good tablet when it comes to battery life and the touch screen is also bad for me. I am not sure what is going on with the battery but the G2 doesn't hold a charge very well, especially on the touch. The screen is just not bright enough to use in direct sunlight. It has also caused the tablet to be much less durable and a real headache to keep in a charger for long periods. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This unit worked as advertised. The only problem is that it was never reset to factory settings and was never changed to the right software to make it usable. It took 5 minutes to go into the menu and change to the default software to the last one it was set to and I got "unable to connect to the network" and "network unavailable" on every device I connected to.   A month later I get "error: system configuration changed, not yet persisted" and this time I have tried a different network and it works fine.  A week later I find that my USB-C port won't power any USB-A devices, and I was forced to buy a new keyboard for $25. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned this device for over a year now. I was very happy with the device until I tried to charge the device using the USB port. The power supply was plugged in, but the device refused to charge because of a bad connection to the wall power. I took the unit back to the store, but they said the unit was defective and would not be able to charge. I went to another store, and the manager at the store said he could not order a replacement and only offered me a $15 credit towards a replacement if I returned the product. I asked him how it got bad, and he replied that someone must have "left it plugged in when he put it on the charger for the night." I feel like I was tricked into buying a defective product. If I had known this was the case, I wouldn't have purchased it.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Dave from Battery issue... Battery issue! I bought this device last August and it works great. The battery is a little on the slow side but that isn't a problem as it doesn't last a whole day anyway. The problem is the USB cable is a real pain to get to the back of the unit. /rant/  There are some good reviews out there about the battery life of this unit. So I decided to use my own money to give it a fair shot. I used my USB to 5-volt bus adapter with a high quality cord. It is now two months later and the unit still won't charge. The unit is sooo old it is now dying in the middle of a charge. Please fix this one before I have to buy a new one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a 3 inch CRT monitor.   The monitor has been working well for over three months and I can't recommend it.  After installing a software called "Vic2" that's been on it for six months, the monitor shows no response from it's keyboard.  The mouse is almost useless.  I went and bought a new monitor from an actual manufacturer to replace it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed is the battery. It took 5 hours to charge from a full 0.7V charge and only had 1.6% battery remaining when I shut it off. It seemed to be a bit faster and more efficient at charging from a fully depleted state. The second thing was the volume buttons. If your ears are anything like mine, the volume button is the least pleasant part of the phone because it just seems to be annoying to press all the time and I have found that many people's ears like a little more variety when it comes to their volume levels. I didn't expect a high quality phone and I don't regret buying it because there was plenty of room on the side of the battery for an extra battery. However, there are a lot of issues with this phone that really make me question its value as a whole.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So I just got my Note 3 yesterday and I was pretty excited to check it out. After reading the specs I thought that it's definitely a nice phone. Everything seems great. I bought the blue color but the white is too bright and my wife doesn't like it so I don't think we'll ever get the white. Other than that it has everything I was hoping for. The one issue I have is that the camera on the Note 3 isn't very good. It's just not as good as my Galaxy S6. The pictures don't do it justice and it's very grainy when you zoom in. I also noticed that if you take a picture, you can't turn it off but the camera still works so I'm just waiting for a better camera from the Note 4. The speaker on the back of the Note3 is horrible. I tried to fix it and I just can't figure out how. The camera is pretty good. The battery life is great. My overall opinion on the device is good. I would definitely buy this phone again. A very nice feature of the phone is the fingerprint scanner. It took a little while for it to work, but after about 5 tries I was able to type my username, password and PIN. The Note 3 has a very nice camera and I'm pleased that Samsung has added a couple of extra features. Unfortunately, the one drawback is that I'm not a fan of the camera. I was actually pretty disappointed. After getting the Note, I went on the market and got my Galaxy Note 4 to make this review complete. I love the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, but that's a pretty big difference in this review.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    5/5 I bought the BKW-15. It works very well for a compact size. I have not found any way to replace the USB port (that is not on the bottom of the device) and have had to buy a new USB cable and adapter that cost over 20$. The battery is a good size, has good rechargeable battery life (7 hours). If you want a little more battery life, then get the 12V/3A (but the price is higher) or the 10V/2A. Overall, good device for the price and good performance for a smaller device. 5/5  4/5 Pros: + Easy to charge + Good battery life + Easy operation + Good quality Cons: - Nothing I can complain about other than I'd rather have a better charger than one that doesn't fit inside of a small case.  2/5 Overall, an acceptable product but not great, but acceptable for $60. ,  10/10
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I used this product for the first time yesterday, and immediately realized it is not what I thought it would be.   This has to be the weakest link in a very strong case.  If I had read a review I could have been a lot more confident of my purchase.  I am disappointed because I bought a product for myself because I thought its performance would make a difference in the quality of life.  What a waste of money.  The buttons do not work and the only thing I can think to do is send it back and get a new one because the device has no power.  This is a complete failure and an insult to people who invest in their electronics.  You will not be able to use this product.  Also I would not recommend this product if you have been smoking a lot of cigarettes.  It works like the last one and I do not use e-cigarettes.  Hopefully the new models will have better batteries.  So not impressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this to use in my RV to charge my cellphone. The quality of the phone plug that I chose was very cheap but did the job. However, this did NOT work with my Sony Xperia Z3, which was using a USB Type A. This is a very large plug, and it took an hour and a half to get it into the back of the RV and to work. I have a Z3 Mini, and the Z3 does not need this, but I could have done the same thing in my Mini with a Mini plug. My next order from this company will be to return this and get a Mini and USB Type B.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from I bought this plug to be my "go-to" for charging my cellphone, but it is great too! I bought it for my phone and it fits very well and does what it says, charging my phone without any issues!  Product Review: Great plug for portable devices. Excellent quality and fits great in most backpacks. The plug has an integrated LED to indicate when charging or for phone charging.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's hard to believe that, in 2014, the world is still being ravaged by a horrible product that is capable of causing so much harm.   The XOOM is not a bad product:  There are better devices out there, and it is also possible to make better devices, but I will not recommend it.  The price of the XOom, for the price, is very high:  $100, and if it weren't for a $100 rebate, you can expect to pay around $100 for an electronic device.  It is hard to use:  With a built in IR transmitter and receiver, the Xoom can easily turn on your lights.  This can be done without having to get a remotes, and the XOM uses one of those.  If you want to control multiple things at once, the remote can only be used in the Xom.  Some users have had difficulty controlling the Xooom with the included remotes:  Some of these remotes can take a very long time to set up and even longer to set off.  They don't seem to work well in some situations, and some of them can be lost very easily.  I had problems with them going into standby mode and not being able to take over the IR blaster from my phone.  Xoom does work, but requires some thought and patience to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use a Samsung Galaxy S4 for my daily needs, and this is my least favorite phone of the bunch. It has a lot of flaws: The buttons are not the best. The power button does not do anything. The microphone is terrible. I tried to remove the camera from the back of the phone (a process that required some effort) and it is glued down.   There are a ton of issues that can be fixed, but no amount of tinkering will turn the Galaxy S 4 into a usable product.  This is also the worst phone I have ever owned.  This is also a pretty expensive phone, though not quite as bad as some other expensive phones I have owned. You may also have heard of the Nexus 4, which is a fantastic phone and was made by LG. The Samsung Galaxy is similar, but the battery life is pretty bad. The best feature of this phone is the camera. It is a really fun camera to use and the pictures you take are beautiful. The one flaw I have found is the way the display and buttons are placed, but nothing is broken. The only real problem with this phone that you can't easily fix is the battery. It lasts a day, but it needs to be recharged every couple of days. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      I've been through a few of these devices, and I have to say that this one just doesn't get the job done. It's extremely noisy, even though I turn it off and on several times a day. If your house is too quiet (i.e., all your neighbors are asleep) this might be a good choice. Otherwise, I don't recommend this item.  Great Sound Quality, But Loud & Uncomfortable!    If I could give it zero stars I would, but the sound quality and comfort are worth the extra cost.   The quality of the sound comes from the solid build of the device, the rubber headband for the earphones. The soft silicone headband is comfortable, though I'd prefer to have the soft silicone part of the headband that wraps around your head. The sound quality is very good and doesn't have any distortion, yet still have a good low end to it. It has a nice bass to it, although the bass isn't so big that it's uncomfortable. It really helps that the bass is controlled by the volume. I'm only running a set of my ATH-M50x, so I can't compare to others, but this is a good setup to have as an alternative to the ATH's for bassheads.   in addition to the solid sound quality, the comfort of the earpiece is amazing. I can wear these all day, and it's very comfortable and secure, even without a neckband.   a good thing about these headphones is that you can get the "free" version of the app to get a better idea of the settings, and how they match up. The free version is good, but you can find better sound settings on the app. , and i can only attribute the poor sound quality to the fact that the earpieces are made from very cheap plastic. The earpieces also have a very slight clamp to them, and the headbands have too little padding to be very comfortable. I'd recommend getting something that has a lot of padding to it if your ear canals are large and not flexible (i'm about 6'2" and 190lbs), and if you are running a very small neckband, (i have a KEF GX1000 neckband and it works really well).If your house has very little to no noise at night, (and I recommend that you install your sound canceling or earb
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the issues i had with my new iPod nano is that the headphone connector just wouldn't stay connected to the device even after reconnecting it several times. After trying several methods to reconnect the headphone and it just wouldn;t work and would have to be taken out and resoldered. When i first got the nano i thought it would be fine because i always connected my iphone to the same cord.   In my case it worked but   in other cases the headphone connection would just come loose, making it impossible to plug in a headphone.  I'm not saying that the nano doesn't work because it DOES work, but i really don't like the way it works and would prefer to switch to a bluetooth headset.  For more information see:

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are a few things I would love to see improved in the future: 1. The built-in speaker is loud but not the same as a external speaker. I do like the volume and volume range, but not quite what I wanted. 2. This is the only one of my iPod/iPhone devices to have been on the market for a year. So, there is some wear and tear, but it's only minor things. 3. I have had this thing for about 2 years. This will be the last one I buy. I'm not holding out hope, but I'd love to get a replacement sooner than that. Overall, I love this thing. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great portable mp3 player!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently received my 2nd Apple Watch in a week.   While I have worn the other Apple Watch (and Apple Watch Sport) before, this is the first time I've actually had the wrist straps work and the display work.  This is not a case of my Apple Watch breaking.  It just didn't display anything.  I had it for about a week, but didn't get much time on it.  One of the first things I did with it was take it on a hike.  By far the best feature of the watch is the battery life.  For the first couple hours I couldn't believe I had to charge it, but the watch has an internal rechargeable battery so it took about 20 minutes.  Now, I usually leave the watch charging and then I just forget about it, especially because the screen is so nice and clear.  The main issue I have with the watch as a whole is that the second screen is only visible on the front and doesn't show any useful information.  You can see some data at a glance but there isn't much to see.  With the second watch you can see more about the day or a week or a month, but it isn't really anything to write home about.  However, if you're looking for a nice watch with good battery life then this is a great option.  My only complaint is that you can't do a silent alarm.  If you want a watch that can do alarms and other stuff then you really need to get the Apple Watch Plus.  Overall, I really liked this watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (I've been a fan of   since before   even existed!)   So in other words,   is a bad product.  It's good at one thing and one thing only:  (to say nothing of !  )  Â    Â  (it's got all the features the   market needs.  And it's   cheap at   $50! But it's bad at everything else!

But that's the price of entry for   the industry   today.  The   cameras   that are "prosumer grade" Â  today   for just $199.99 are Â  a lot more impressive   than   anything   like   Canon's  Â  G1.  You know what I'm talking about.

What you've got today is a lot like when the Â  first   digital cameras Â  were released.  In 1976, the D-SLR market was dominated by Nikon.  Nikon made the Nikon F1 and F3. Nikon madeÂ  the $400 Nikon F2 and Nikon F3,Â  the first DSLRs with 35mm or medium format film formats, respectively. Nikon was the dominant camera maker at the time because they had superior image quality. Nikon had a higher quality sensor than any of the competing cameras in the market, which meant they could make the highest quality images. Nikon even made its own interchangeable lenses that rivaled any lens from any of
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to go to two different dealers for repairs because the phone I have doesn't work as good as the other. It doesn't have the best sound quality either, but if you can get past that, this is a good phone.    Rated 3 out of 5 by dave from Very good phone, very annoying to deal with. The phone is nice and compact. It is a high end device. But the user experience, phone and service. They have been very poor. I don't understand why you can't just have the manufacturer provide you with some sort of warranty. They tell me that if the phone breaks I can send it back and they will send me a new one free of charge. That's not true. I paid an extra $80 for a full replacement warranty which they do not offer. There have been several times when the phone was completely dead. I have sent it back twice. The third time they told me I would need to wait for it to be shipped back to them. That seems odd since it was sent to them for repair. After two weeks I still haven't had my phone. I'm not giving up. So far they are only interested in replacing the battery. So what's the point of buying this expensive phone if it's not going to be repaired by the manufacturer?  5 5 Great phone I had a Samsung phone for years and loved it but found that the software update was very slow. This time around I had the opportunity to buy a T-Mobile phone so I thought I would give it a try. I went to a Ting store where a young lady was very helpful and very nice. I also contacted my dealer and was told he could take care of it. So he did. He said he would need a credit card, which I didn't have, but I would be able to pick it up later. He even said that I could just tell him it wasn't working. So I went online, got an IMEI number, went to the T-mobile site and found the correct phone number. The store sold me the phone and I called T-mo. I gave my T-Mo number and asked if I would get a phone number I could return it to at a later time. I got a text saying that I should expect the phone in 1-2 days and that I would have a call with the techs. I received a call the next day. The call went really
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is my first electronic device of my own so I can't comment about the reliability of this device but I think the quality of it's construction and design is great. It has the ability to be easily moved from a PC to my   MacBook but I have to think about that, as you are only allowed to use it on one computer (I would recommend this over my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because the S3's are not available here in the US). As for how it functions, I'm having trouble finding the button I need to charge my iPhone, and I have the Samsung Galaxy 4. But overall I think it's a good buy, and is well worth the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's hard to believe that I bought this for a friend. She loves her ipod but was not a fan of the size of it and the fact that it's black instead of white. So after trying this device I was very pleased. The sound quality is very good. This ipod works well with the iPhone 4S.  Â I used it with my iPod and iPod nano and I like it so much. Â The battery life on this device is very impressive and it's the only device I've found that has an aux cord built in so you don't have to use the 2.1 microphone jack. The only thing that I don't like about this ipod is the way that it holds the battery and that's really all I have to say.  I've been using it now for a few days and have not had a problem.  I've also been using the ipod while my phone was plugged into the charger and it worked fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had purchased this speaker for a client's business. I had it sent out the next day. It came with no accessories whatsoever. The speaker itself is very thin. It is also very light and has a very small sound. It can not compete with other electronic speakers. I did not buy it to replace my other speakers. It was to be my go to piece for my client's music collection. Now I have a $45 piece that just sits in a drawer. I don't know what happened. Maybe I was a bad choice of client. I know I could have picked a better one. Also, I didn't think about the price. The quality of this speaker is just as good as my Sonos system with the same speaker.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't have many problems with the product but this one has no power supply and is very noisy. I got it with a usb to micro usb cord and it came in a nice white box that was also black but not white and black, it looks like a clear plastic box and i am not sure if it has a metal case. It is very difficult to attach the cord to the device. It also has a weird, high pitched sound that you can hear if you are looking straight at it, this makes it harder to see in darker rooms. It has the annoying sound when the power supply starts so i ended up using a spare USB port on my Macbook, and i was able to connect to it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you are a new owner of a smartphone, I hope this blog will be of some assistance to you!   I have only owned this for a few weeks, but from what I have read, I am happy with the purchase.   When I first plugged it in, I heard a loud noise. After a few seconds, I noticed a beeping noise. I checked the screen, and sure enough, the beeping started going back and forth. The light in the back was also flickering around the time the beeps were going back/forth. After several minutes, the device would not power up. The unit was completely dead. After recharging it several times, the battery would power up for about 5-10 minutes, but then the light would come back on and go out again.  I called and they told me to try a different charger and that the unit should work fine. I then tried to use the phone, and it would not connect to the computer. I was not able to send text messages with my email account, and emailing was very slow, so I am having trouble finding a way to use this.  There is absolutely nothing I would change about this purchase! I have purchased several electronic devices in the past and I can't say that this is my least favorite. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this unit for just over a week and used it for just under 3 hours a day. It's hard to find good batteries for this type of thing but I had no issues with the battery. There was a little bit of a "click" and the whole thing "clicked" as soon as the battery was inserted in. After that it lasted me a long while. I got a 1/4" drive out of the box which was fine I thought. I thought it would last maybe a year but it has lasted at least three years. It was the case with every other product I have bought.   It's easy to use, very easy to mount, and it is well built.  The only thing that's disappointing is that if you mount it on the wall, the case doesn't stay in place. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this for a couple of weeks now, and it's just a cheap, plastic case with the built in camera. I have a Samsung Note7, and while it's great to be able to share photos with my friends via Snapchat, I don't think it would work as well with the GoPro. You need a case with a lot more rubber than the GoPro's case, plus a waterproof seal and it just becomes a cumbersome camera. The video also is a bit shaky, and the camera is a little bulky in comparison to a phone. If you can get past these limitations, the GoPro is a great camera. However, when I'm on vacation, or away from a computer, I'd prefer to keep my phone.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I use this product in a variety of applications (e.g. in an application that requires me to move quickly on the screen so as to not miss an image of an object) - It is a bit slow. The response time is good, but it is much slower than the iPhone or other similar devices that are much cheaper and much faster. Also, the volume control on this device is not as good as on a good device. This is due to the fact that it has a 1/8" output. This means that you can hear your music louder than on a decent device, but then you may not be able to control your volume as well. It is not a good deal in my book.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the best things I have done is got the ELCOM EZ-POD-12D from this site and the E-Z-Lite EZ24.   I have had all three and I have to say that the EZPOD is by far the best.  I was always frustrated with the poor batteries from other brands and the quality of this is top notch.  EZLite can make a very good battery but I think this battery is top quality.  If you have a EZlite E-V1 or E-G1 just get an EZ25 because the E25 is an inferior product.  And I would not bother with the EL-C11 or E14 or E11 because they are so bad they are useless.  The EZlite is better.  Now I know that there are many opinions on this site but my rating is based on the quality and value I receive and the price I pay.  Also, I have used all three products and they are the only batteries that have worked consistently. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got this mouse I really liked it, the sensitivity was perfect. However, the mouse eventually broke. First it fell off during an airplane flight. I could not fix it by myself, so I had to call my insurance company. Once I finally got it working, I took it everywhere with me. I bought another, but that one also broke within a week. Then I bought a third one, and it also broke. This is not the first mouse I have had problems with, it has been broken at least 5 times now. I have to pay for shipping, which is ridiculous. Not to mention, it's expensive to ship to my state. If I wanted a better quality mouse, I could buy a $40 mouse, and get a free box.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the few drawbacks is that the device is too small to fit in any car glovebox. The USB connector is on the side of the device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for a family member who is disabled and also has bad vision. It is not an easy thing to see with, but the glasses are clear and work well. The only problem is the screen does not focus. Also the camera cannot turn off so it must be kept on. The earphones are good for music. The one thing is that it does not work with the iPad so you can not use the tablet with this. I have had it for a month and it still does not have the battery power I am expecting. I hope the quality improves and I will be happy to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (I bought an inexpensive wireless keyboard for a friend) I can't really say anything bad about the keyboard, but there is no way to type on the keyboard with the power key on. The wireless keyboard, although cheaper, doesn't work as well. It only recognizes "1", "2", "3", "4" and "5". Not a very useful keyboard for typing a lot of letters on. Also, the keyboard is a little to small for my taste. The USB port on the back is nice, but the cable is a bit too short to type a whole paragraph on it. You could get a longer USB cable but the keyboard would be slightly to small to use. The keyboard will definitely fit with a Bluetooth keyboard on it, but not with a regular keyboard. Maybe it will in a few years, or I'll have to upgrade it to get better battery life.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It has many issues, but I still bought it because it was advertised as having an HDMI port for output to a television. It does not, and I had to make it work by using a separate receiver to connect a separate monitor to the monitor. Other than that, it's great, works great for me, but it could be better.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So... I bought a few things from this store. First, the watch is not waterproof (like every other watch in this store). It also has a very simple case, which is kinda annoying. I had to buy the leather strap, and then I realized that my watch will not keep a charge. Also, I really like the watch, but I am pretty much just using it to track my steps, which I can't do with this device. I really don't want to pay extra for this watch, so I don't recommend this store for buying any expensive electronic device. I'm sorry for the long review.   I'd love to talk more about the watch. This is a great watch! The case is simple and durable, but doesn't look cheap, and it's actually a pretty nice looking watch. The watch is small, but it does look good on my wrist. It's waterproof, has a bright green face, and is pretty accurate, as far as I can tell. Â This watch comes in a couple different colors, but they're a little bit off, so if you want a different color, you'll have to buy another one. The face is nice, and you can choose between the red and blue faces.  This is a good, cheap, accurate watch.  But I'm kinda disappointed.  I have a pretty cheap watch as well, which works just fine, but is cheaper than this one. I bought this watch because of the price point, but the accuracy isn't very good, and the face is really, really ugly. I'm really not a fan of ugly faces. I hope the case is made of leather, because I'd really like to be able to see the hands, so that I can be sure of what time it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have purchased a number of products from this company in the past, and was always satisfied with them. However, the new Samsung Tablet PC is a total dud. I have not been impressed with the display quality, and it is not very power efficient. It is not fast enough to use on the road, it has some really stupid memory management settings that lead to excessive loading of the disk, and even when I turn off my internet connection, it continues to try to use the internet in the background. I should have waited to get this model, because it's not worth the price.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My Samsung Galaxy S5 has started dying. I've had it for about a week. I read the original review here: http://forums.google.com/forum/#!topic/mobil...9mhqc4wq#.VNtHj3ZKp1U and that was a good review. Then I got a replacement and I just got one with a major defect. When I turned the phone on, the screen would light up and the whole phone would turn on. I thought, "Oh, no, something must be wrong, that must be what's wrong." So I unplugged the phone and turned it on. When it turned off, the phone would not turn off. Instead it was just a blinking red light on the screen, no sound. I removed the battery, the red light disappeared, but the phone still won't turn off, so I took the phone off the charger, put it into the dock, turned off the phone, and now it works. I'm using it as my main phone and it still works fine, so the thing just didn't work as expected. Samsung, I'm disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device arrived damaged. I used the original usb cable and it took a while to plug it into my laptop. The USB connector is not the same as a usb-c-cable and did not work well. The battery is bad. No charge for 2 weeks after using it. I bought this for my daughter because she can't afford a laptop.   It is a great computer, but it's a really expensive one.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good for the price I had been using a Lenovo Thinkpad T400 with a usb 2.0 cable for a long time. I've had it since 2011. I decided to upgrade to the T400s and this new device came with the right USB cable (but it's only USB 3.0) and a new battery (I guess you don't get a second battery on a laptop for $1000+). It works perfectly out of the box (tested for a couple of weeks) and there's no sign of wear on the display. I would have liked to see a wireless keyboard on the T420, but the Thinkpad keyboard is the same size and key layout as the one on the X240. The Thinkpad is light and thin, so the keyboard is well worth the money. I only have one issue with this product. On the first day using it, I had to open and close the lid multiple times to reset the bluetooth connection. I tried to re-pair it on a different computer, and it's still on the initial pairing process (the laptop says "this is an internal Bluetooth connection").  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device itself is a good design for the price, but the interface is terrible. This is a problem with all these models because the control buttons are tiny and hard to use. The screen is small, the buttons are small, and the design is small.   The "cog" of the device is very small. The unit can easily fit in your back pocket or bag for a briefcase.  Unfortunately, the screen does not work. The image is very fuzzy when it is displayed.  This is one of those issues that is hard to explain because it is so different from any other electronic device you have ever used.  What is it? It is not a phone.  The display and keypad are both analog, and do not work in any way, shape, or form like an iPhone.  For some reason the touchscreen works, but all of the buttons do not.  You have to press on the bottom to do anything.  It is difficult to use because of the large keys that have a very small profile, making it impossible to use in a single hand.  These are all things that most people will see as very important.  I would say that the best aspect of this product is that it is smaller than an iPhone and has more features than an iDevice.  But this is not something that is easily explained with just a paragraph on the box. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently bought a digital music player for my iphone iphones, and after using the device for a few days it stopped working.   When i go back to the store to buy an iphoner it was only $9.99   The product was great and the customer service was great   but there is a huge difference between a good and bad product. I do not think that a company like this should be taking business away from other retailers.  Review by: Jason A. - San Diego, CA - June 23, 2012 :  This was my first experience with customer service. I was informed the item was defective after my 2nd purchase from them and refunded for the 2nd unit. My experience with digital music was good but this store should probably consider providing a free shipping option as well. They should be able to handle the higher volume requests with an educated customer and not just refund the item if it breaks when you are expecting it to be working correctly. -Jason

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased an Apple TV for my son in October of 2014, and he started playing it about a month after I received it. He is a "cord cutter," and he has no interest in buying any additional electronic devices. After playing with the Apple TV's "all in one" design for a few months, he grew tired of it and moved on. I was surprised to see the price drop, but it's hard to justify when the product has so many negatives. The remote is too sensitive for my taste. It feels like someone rubbed a turd on the top of it. I think I could break it by holding the remote too long. The design of the remote is not intuitive. It's also really hard to reach the back buttons because the controls are so close together, even in the box. The front-facing camera is super annoying. You have to hold it up to your mouth to see what's on the screen. It only works in low light. The audio quality is so bad that I don't even use it anymore. If you have a big screen TV or a very bright home theater room, it's worth giving it a try. But for me, the AppleTV is just not worth it, no matter how hard I try. - by karri-jenni from nyc I have had this tv for about a year and used it mostly for my kids so far I really like the features and all the tv apps. So far no issues other than the apple tv remote and all in one tv box. - but I can easily say this is a great idea as it is small, so small you can put in the palm of your hand and does not take up a lot of space. - it is also quite sturdy, so you can use it as a small computer as well. the remote and remote apps are very good and work well. - the tv box is also good and works just fine and does all the things my other tv boxes do. - I wish they made it in a wider size. it is just right for most people, but maybe a 10 inch is a good size. - also this tv box has a very small tv remote, which i don't mind but would have loved a bigger one like in my other TV's. - i would also like to see a blu ray player in the remote. I use my tv with my ipod for video books, and it would be nice if that came
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Â "   I've been using my old Thinkpad T400s for years. I thought I could use the Thinkpad to get me through some of my more advanced programming work, but with this, I've only made minimal progress at best, I'm just trying to figure out the basics, it's not the "Ultimate" solution to everything but it's a good enough device for most of my needs (e.g. it has some of the essential keyboard functionality for the job at hand).   If you're not a fan of Thinkpads, this probably isn't for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very good tablet that works with a great tablet and keyboard.  It has a full USB port.  Very bright and a good viewing angle.   I had to use the adapter to get a USB 3.0 port. I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 and the Tab 8.9. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's not really an Apple product.   What I mean is, if you are looking for a nice, solid computer that is easy to use and doesn't require a ton of hard drive space, you should probably give it a miss.  The keyboard is a bit of a let down compared to the other Apple keyboards.  It is more comfortable, but it's not quite as good as it could be.  I'm not sure I'd buy it again.  But it is certainly nice to have if you want an old school Apple keyboard.   Write a positive review about an excellent electronic device, or a bad one:  The Eee PC was my first PC, and it worked flawlessly for the first year and a half. But after that it just fell apart.  What's the point of having a computer if it can't even keep up with you?  I spent an hour trying to figure out what's going on in my system before I figured out that the hard drive on the first hard drive was failing.  With this second hard drive, the computer would freeze on startup up to four times in a row.  A quick reboot solved that, but the problem still persisted.  So I replaced the hard drives, and they work fine now, but not as well as they did before.  Now I have two hard drives for backups.    I bought this computer for a little over $600, but I have used it so much since I bought it that I just returned it.  Not worth the price tag.  My advice to anyone looking for an inexpensive computer is to buy one with a large hard drive or at least a faster drive.  This thing is great for the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â  I was in the market to buy a laptop and I saw that Apple had released the new MacBook Pro   as well as a   laptop that looked similar to the original .   But this is not what I wanted. I wanted a  PC with   a  very  large   screen and full size keyboard.  When   I first got it I tried using it and found it hard to get   the mouse to work.  I could not seem to get the touch screen to work   and the battery would keep dying.  So I ordered a replacement battery and   got another machine. The new model was much more powerful. I bought a  new  Â i5 and was able to get everything I needed out of it except the touch pad. So when I got the second one and tried it again I realized it is not like the original. The touchpad is too hard to use , and the keyboard is far from the original keyboard. I decided I will not go with it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device does not work for me and I want to switch it out for a better product.   The only problem is it took a bit of work to get the cord to plug into my computer.  It was easy to put together, but there was one small problem that was so obvious I had to look at the product before I purchased it.  I bought it to use it with my phone, but I ended up taking it back to get another one. I did try to do a power strip but ended up getting a screw driver because the power cord wasn't made to be used with a screwdriver.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    We replaced our home theatre receiver with the AVB7200 (we had a 4-channel, 7.1 surround system that we no longer use) and it works perfectly. The sound quality is amazing (not really an "improvement" when our home system was $150 more), the included remote control is a great idea, the build quality is excellent, and there is no bloatware to get in the way. For only $149, you are getting a great receiver that can also double as a home theater with its 8 HDMI inputs (8 surround audio) and 7.2-ch. speaker output. If you need something with a lot of HDMI inputs and a lot more power than the AVN6200 and have $150 or less to spend on a receiver (like us), then this is the receiver for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Posted by: David at 11:25 AM I recently purchased a Sennheiser HD650 which, after receiving, seemed like a wonderful choice. I've had the HD650 for about three weeks now and its no longer the HD500 I've been using. There is some "clicking" when pressing buttons that I think is an improvement over the HD510 but that isn't the only thing I'm disappointed in. First of all, there is too much noise on the headphone itself. My room has the same type of furniture as the HD505 but with an even lower sound level. The noise is also a bit more noticeable than the HD520 and it makes some people in the living room or the kitchen think I'm not in the room with them. Now that I've played around with it a bit, it seems to be a good improvement on my old pair but I can't really say it's worth the price anymore. A lot of reviews I've read claim that the HD600 is a "more open" headphone that should be used with lower-end speakers. I don't really like this because my room sounds just as good with a lower-cost pair of cans like the HD518 or HD598. If I had to pick a headphone to replace the HD610 or HD620, I'd go with the HD630. They sound a lot warmer and have a nice open sound signature. If you can get over that clickiness, you can still listen to the HD660 and HD660ii.  This headphone is good in terms of bass but not quite as good as the X-Fi Titanium 2 and Senns e-A3. Also the HD700s are a bit too bright and have too much bass for my taste. However, I do think the HD800 is a decent headphone for people who want a more neutral and detailed sound, though the HD850 is a better choice for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am a professional computer consultant, and I own a PC with an Intel 82570. The screen is not bright enough to read well, the speakers are weak and the trackpad is really poor. I have only used this computer for gaming and media. The keyboard is fine. It is a little awkward to use as a desktop computer, as it is in fact two computers - a monitor, and a PC. It's better suited for use as an HTPC. I haven't tried it for a lot of work, but I suspect it would be a decent HTPC, but with a monitor and not with a keyboard. If you don't need a big keyboard, this is a good buy for a budget. The battery is a bit old, so you'll need to charge it often, but it's cheap.  Rated 4 out of 5 by N1r2p4v4n from It does it's job! I have a 2 year old Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 2.4Ghz. I had been looking at various options for a new laptop and wanted something with more power. This little computer does the job perfectly. If I had to do it all over again I would definitely get the next one up, but this one is an excellent value for the money. I like the fact that there is a case with a back plate and I can use the touchpad to control the laptop. The case is also easy to clean. The system is pretty quiet while it is running and has decent specs. The problem I have found is with the keyboard, as I am used to a larger keyboard, especially on a desktop. I am going to have to use the same key caps for my keyboard as I have on my PC so I don't have to worry about having to purchase extra ones.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this as a gift. I loved it but it just didn't have the sound quality I was expecting. When I first got it and turned it on the sound is amazing, but then the screen begins to flicker and then the speakers are barely audible.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a Motorola RAZR M Android smart phone to replace my original Motorola RAX-I Smart phone. It came in a very hard plastic casing. The screen is a little small and light and it also doesn't have any buttons. So I have to use a special phone book app on my iPhone to call up contacts, send emails etc. It doesn't matter how good an app is, when there's no keypad it is a pain.   It was very nice when I first got it but as I've had to deal with it more and more I've found that it's extremely annoying that there's not a way to do some basic things that an iPhone does. For example, I wanted to be able to take a photo of a friend's phone screen with the RAZ r. So when I tried to take the photo it only showed the picture of the display and that was it. This is not very smart as it can be a lot easier to use an iPhone for these sort of photos. The camera is also not very good so I can only imagine how bad it would be if it could actually take photos.  I've used this phone for a week and while it's not terrible it's still a pretty terrible phone for the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You know what you are getting with these. I purchased 2 of these, thinking they were great for recording our voice over work. Boy, am I surprised. These things are great for taking home recordings for the family to listen to... but the noise that these recorders make is just about impossible to turn off.   This thing has more volume then a jackhammer. This is great for home recording for your kids.  I have a friend who had to get his wife to buy these so that he can record his kids. They can record music too, and I believe this is not a good idea.  I bought these as my first ever "professional" audio recorder, and while they are a great addition to my home studio, they do require serious setup, especially the record buttons. They are a pain to set up. The batteries last a few hours (at best), and are very difficult to replace. They need to have a manual for setting them up. I would avoid purchasing them if you plan to use them for your own home recording project, or if you intend to use these to record yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â   Â I bought the   iPhone 6S and   didn't like it at all.   It  didn  t  like my  phone   to   phone,   i   and  to,  and that   made me sad  .   After   a couple of days   of   use   I  ,  I started to  change my   opinion   as to  it   usefulness   at   all . Â  But then   again ,   after   10   hours   time   with   it,  i realized   the  i iPhone 6s   is   really   bad   for   me . My   wife   loves   my  iPhone   so   she   would   like   new   instead  of   this   ugly   thing   now.  How   can   you   help   us   in  this situation? Thank you. Answer:  In this situation, i recommend you to take back the  phone that  you want to have in future. I can only advise you to buy a new  phone at a cheap price. This   does   not   mean that the  iPhone6S   should  not be used  anymore. Question:  If the  Apple   iPad   (with Retina display)   were  to be Â produced in China   why   do  you Â  want   your   money   returned ? Answer: China manufactures   many  other   products   than   computers   such   devices   which   are   expensive   compared   others. China is also   able   produce these   cheap   items for cheap prices so  that  consumers from  outside   China  can enjoy the cheap products  of China. Answer: The  iPhone4   was   produced in China because  Apple didn't want  consumers of  countries that  could produce similar   product and at the same time sell at cheaper prices. So, the  Mac   wasn't   manufactured in  China because it Â  wasn't
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My new laptop ran really bad and the battery never lasts more than 3 to 4 hours of full use.   (I do use it all day long.)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace a cell phone that I had that had stopped working. The device arrived and it was a bit slow but that was not the problem, the problem was with the battery, it did not last more than an hour.

Review of DJI Phantom 3 Professional Quadcopter by Roberta S. on March 13, 2015 : (no rating)  I have been a flying enthusiast for a little over a year. I started with a DJI Mavic Pro and it has proved to be reliable and I was very impressed with the performance of this unit.  on March 6, 2015, at 11:57 pm, Roberta from Chicago, IL (Zone 6b) wrote: I have been using this camera for about a month and I am very satisfied with the Phantom 3. You must be very careful with batteries and also with the unit itself. The batteries in the unit have a tendency to explode and can be very dangerous if dropped onto carpet. The unit does not automatically turn off when it runs out of batteries. You have to press the power button once and wait about 2 minutes for it to turn off. The Phantom 3 does require a power plug as the battery is not interchangeable with a GoPro or similar style. Also, the battery life on the Phantom has been disappointing to say the least. It has been a month since I have flown and I have only flown about 2 hours. I was initially very excited about the Phantom as I was used to using a GoPro but now I feel like it will be a disappointment in the long run. I am currently in the process of contacting DJI about this issue. I will be buying a Hero 3+ only. .  a customer on February 28, 2015 at 2:18 am, Steve from San Francisco (Zone 9b) added: I've been flying this for about three weeks now. The only problem I have encountered is the battery. The first time I put the batteries in I realized they were small, so I had to use zip ties to hold them in place. This had the unexpected side effect of making the unit extremely difficult to turn on and off. The battery life has been the same as my other drones. About 2-3 hours. Review by: Matt
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You can't compare it to a proper radio (for more details: Â http://www.pittsburgh-citizen.org/2012/07/05/on-the-b...). I bought one because I want to get the most out of it, but it has no range on its own and when I am out, I have to call in to the tower to hear it. It's a great thing if you are out in the field and you just want to listen in to people on the ground. If the range is the only reason you are buying this, forget it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I tried to buy the product a while ago but the product could not be found in any of the stores. When i tried to find this brand in the Internet i was given a few sites but the price was too expensive for me so i gave up and used my own money. The product was not worth the money i spent on it. This product has some serious design flaws. The size of the unit is too small for my needs. It comes in a small box that is too easy to lose if the lid is open. This is a real pain to carry around the house in a tight pocket. The keyboard is just too small. When I type, I can only use the keys that are easy to reach (those that are to my left and right.) If i type quickly, there are only 5 or 6 keys I can use. If I want to do more complicated stuff, I have to scroll through many pages of keys just to get to my intended keys and it is a lot of trouble. It does work but the design flaws make me very unhappy with the purchase. I tried replacing the unit, but the batteries did not work and i got another one which i did not like at all. I also tried buying a different model and it cost about the same as the original model. I hope i can use this for a long time to come. I wish I had taken a look at this before buying, since i could have saved me some money.  I don't want to spend too much time, but let me tell you this is the BEST keyboard I've ever used! This keyboard is light, flexible, responsive and easy to use. The keys are comfortable to type on and are comfortable typing on. I use my HP PC to do all my editing and I'm very happy with this keyboard and the software!  Keyboard is great, however there are some bugs. You can get it on Amazon for $29.99 but its a bit too slow (maybe I need to try the Windows version). Also, a lot is missing or can't be found like: the mouse/trackball/touchpad, a couple of USB ports, the battery life, etc. I would like to see an app to add on keyboard shortcuts to the PC.  to the above reviewer, the keyboard is fine. But it could be much better if there was a way to use the left and the right arrow keys on the keyboard to make a custom shortcut key
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was so happy to get my new Samsung phone. My husband told me it was good for video chats, but that it was horrible for internet surfing.  My son loved it, but he could hardly use it.  We had the tablet, but the screen would randomly go blank and the app would freeze up.   The battery ran down quickly.  It's sooo big and heavy.  After we finished using it we took it out and realized the screen is so big it is going to take a good 30 minutes to charge up again.  I do not recommend this product.   Rated 4 out of 5 by jg from Works just fine! We were looking for something that was smaller and lighter than a laptop and this works great! It has great features such as a stylus to use as a touchscreen and stylus pen. I also like the way that it does not have many buttons, but it does have a volume control. The only problem is that we have a small office and I had no room to put it away.  This is a good option if you don't need to get out of your chair to work. The screen is good but not good enough to do 3D graphics.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -   I purchased an Asus Transformer HD tablet in the summer of 2009.   Initially I liked the tablet but the screen was horrible, not even the size of a standard paperback.  The device did run on a 4.6" 320x480 pixel display but that was not nearly the resolution that I wanted.  After searching high and low, I decided to go with a Kindle and was happy that I did.  With a little bit of adjustment to settings, the device was pretty good. However, the screen became unreadable after a few hours of use.

As far as size goes,  it's small enough, yet powerful enough.  That's pretty much it.  For the price point, this   is a no brainer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only problem I have with this is that the battery life is pretty short. I normally use this on my Xbox 360 so that's not a big deal. If you're on a budget or are only going to use it for a short amount of time, I'd probably go with a different USB cable.   Overall, this is a great product for the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a good product, however, I did use it on an old cell phone with an old style display and a tiny button on the bottom of the phone that is easily lost or lost. It worked, but I was frustrated that I had to spend a couple of minutes setting up the settings to be able to use the device. I got a refund for my purchase because I was able to return it within the 2 month window it was advertised.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this laptop for my wife for her work.   She's never used a laptop before, but she is pretty experienced with Apple devices.  I really liked the price, and I've had a lot of success with Apple products, so I really thought that this would be a good buy.  It's a great little PC, but... the screen isn't too great.  The hinge gets stuck in the center, but my only hope was that the screen would loosen up and give a wider view.  That didn't happen.  This laptop is really good for someone like me, who is mostly a laptop user, who gets along with a keyboard and mouse, but really, my wife would rather spend her money on a larger monitor. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was looking for a good quality laptop for travel and school. I was so looking forward to this computer as it's the thinnest and the fastest I could find. But after 2 days of usage I can clearly see how cheap and simple it is. I got this for my mother and she found it to be an utter waste of money! When I opened it up there were scratches on the screen, screen cover was missing, keyboard was cracked, the fan was out of order and the batteries had been used. When I complained about these issues to the seller they told me to try to find a better computer. I can assure you that this computer is terrible. I will never purchase a Lenovo product again.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a bad item.   It is a "toys" product, and I am sure it will do a great deal for a kid. However, a $40.00 price is too high for such a useless product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    What do you do when you are using an electronic device on a public sidewalk and you find a phone stuck between the lamppost and the railing?   What do you think about when you hear someone using a cell phone while walking by?  The majority of people do not want to use their cell phone on public sidewalks.  They don't want their cell phones to become a hazard to their health and to those around them.  People who are trying to use the cell phone during a public walk are doing a disservice to themselves. Â  Cell phone use on public roads is a public safety hazard that can cause accidents and accidents can cause injuries and possibly even fatalities.  Many people don't like being interrupted while doing something else in the park.  Sometimes it is the people who are walking through the park that are interrupted and their cell phones become a distraction and cause a distraction.  The best way to avoid cell phone use while walking is to always walk on a busy road like Kamehameha Highway, Hupa Avenue, or Kapolei Avenue. Â  If you must use your cell phone to contact a loved one, use a land line rather than cell phone.  For emergency messages, the best way is to dial 911 or call an emergency dispatcher.  If you do need to use your phone to call or text, don't do it on a crowded sidewalk.  I like to wear ear buds on my head because my ears get warm when my cell phone is in my ears and I don't know where it is.   I am always aware when I am walking on a sidewalk, because my cell is close by and I can hear it buzzing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Â   Â I've never used it before, so I don't know the technical details. When the battery dies, it shuts down the display, the microphone, and all other functions except for the video output. When you try to press a key or the touch pad, it doesn't work. This is especially annoying if you want to watch a video.     Â  Â  When I tried to use the touchpad to scroll through the video stream, it refused to respond to my touch, so it didn't scroll and I ended up moving the screen around.   This is a very slow phone.  I didn't want to waste time on this phone, so when it died, I threw it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works as expected I used it to plug in the sound system and TV. It worked fine with my TV, but the power button on the TV doesn't work with the audio out. I tried to change it on the back of the box, but it doesn't have a function or switch. I was able to get it to work with my audio by unplugging the power cable from the TV.  Customer Testimonial, from California, USA : I have been using this sound card for a couple of years now and it is the best sound card I have ever used. My PC is a Intel Core2Duo E6600, ATI Radeon HD 5770. It also works fine with Windows 7, although the sound still isn't quite as good as the soundcard from my old PC running XP. I really recommend this card.  a little tricky to install but you get the hang of it, I was installing an XBMC player on it in the end, also, I ran into the same issue with the power light, when I plugged it in it didn't start so I had to power it on and it did turn on, also the remote control came out of the USB port on the end of it, didn't try to re-wire the usb to the back, just remove the battery and plug it in as I had already done before. just wanted to add to a good review.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased my Kindle Fire for my daughter because it would save us time. She can have books that we can read on our phone while we walk to school, go to the park, or just watch television with her. It takes up less space in our house and it saves us money. My wife and I use our Kindle Fire as a work tool. The battery life is less than most. So, this is not a device that is worth my time or money. The only positive aspect of this device is that it allows my wife to read books on the go, even when I am out of the house, but it would be much better if it allowed her to read when I get home and not after I do.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a Dell Latitude G630s, a laptop that I love, that has been out of warranty for nearly 3 years.   The battery is very reliable but it has been constantly running low on power and will run down to only 5% when on a charger, a very big problem for a $500 laptop.  It is one of those "you get what you pay for" situations, and the Latitude g630s would have been worth twice the price if it were not for the "wasted" power.  A new battery is about $30 so I have been waiting for Dell to update the battery.  To date, Dell has not offered me a replacement, and I am now considering selling the laptop, if I can find a better price.  I am considering replacing my current battery for a new one that will run on 12v, but is likely to cost $200. This is a very large loss of value from Dell.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i bought my samsung galaxy s4, the samsung charger was very good and had a good warranty. However, the charger is very flimsy. The charger keeps slipping out of the cradle. I have the same issue on my s5.   i would not recommend buying this.   Best Charger   The best charger i ever used. I also purchased a samsung phone charger and that one too has the issue of falling out of a cradle. This is the only charger that I can use it and get it to sit properly    I purchased 2 Samsung Galaxy S4 s5's. One was the official Samsung Galaxy Charger and it is by far the best charger out there. It has great fast charging. However I purchased the second charger at full price. It only has 3A but still a 3A charger. So you can only use it for 30 mins. This doesn't make sense to me because you can't use a lot of the features. I've bought more than 5 chargers from them, and this is the first one that I will not purchase again.  Worst charger   I bought a Samsung Galaxy s4, and it came with the best Charger for S4, which is a Samsung S3 charger. My s4 charger is a good one, it's the one that comes with samsung. It's very nice charger. However on my first charge, the Samsung Galaxy charger fell out of my pocket. In the beginning I couldn't use it because it fell out but after the second charge, it fell down out of its slot. The Samsung Galaxy was no longer charging, which wasn't a big issue at first, but I got the feeling that it's falling because it's not supporting the s4 properly. So I contacted the Samsung, and I told them that my s3 charger is fine, so they came out and send me a new charger and a new cradle. The new cradle is good. The one that came was not. It is also not that cheap price. I'm disappointed because I paid full price for the official charger. I don't like that, Samsung. But it's my fault. I got it for half price, and now it's a big problem. So if you can give me a free one, I would give that one to you because the official one is perfect. And if you send me the one you gave me as a freebie,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this watch because my wife likes watches and it is a nice looking watch. I also like that it can be paired with other smart watches. When I started using it it was good. I liked it because I was in the habit of having it on the wall and looking at it when I had to talk to someone. It is a good looking watch that is very well made. It's a good deal but I would probably get another one in a different color if I had another watch.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen, while it was bright and clear and had the ability to distinguish between colors, was too bright for my taste.   It has poor sound quality.  It could be because I've been having problems with my speakers and it's been a while since my last computer so I don't know for sure but it doesn't seem to be getting louder as I have been using it for a few days.  I do like how it has all the features I need so I have no problems with it.  My only negative comments are that it didn't come with a charger and the case that comes with it is very cheap.  The best part of it is that it's not too expensive.   5 out of 5 Awesome, Great Value I bought this for a Christmas gift for a friend. He has a lot of electronics, a lot to do. It's his first computer but I think he will like it, although he doesn't have a PC, a Mac, or a tablet and the price was just right. I think this will be good for anyone who's got a lot going on in their house or at work. I'm sure the case will also work for many people. The power cord plugs into the laptop itself which is nice. So far, everything has worked, it seems like it'll get a little hotter but that's to be expected, so you might as well just charge it on the back of your phone or tablet. The screen works really well. I don''t think it''s very bright but it''ll make up for it in the long run.  4 out of 0 found this review helpful The keyboard works great, I like the ability of having an external display. So I bought one and it works great so far! This is a very good computer! I would recommend it. I would like if it was a little brighter to make it easier on the eyes but overall I''m happy. . "4" out of 1 found this Review helpful The computer is very nice for the money, I would have liked to get the external monitor but it was not avaliable, but the computer has been very nice.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you want a good, solid, easy-to-use electronic device and don't mind paying a little extra for it then this is for you. However, you need to take into consideration the fact that this product is a bit more expensive then I expected. It is not a cheap device but for the price it is good enough. There are a couple of things that bother me with this product: 1) It is hard to read the manual. 2) It does not have a USB port to charge the device. So I use my tablet in my car with an auxiliary power supply. So the battery life is not very good. I just hope that it does not get so hot that it blows up. It's great for the average user but for me this is more of a toy than a product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My old computer was so slow that I had to switch to an old Macbook Pro.   It was so sluggish that I almost went through a whole workday without working on my computer.  When I finally got it, it was so laggy that I couldn't do any work except watching movies.  I am now a Mac user and I recommend the   MacBook Air as a replacement.  This product is so slow on Windows that you might as well use your old Mac.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a Kindle Fire for myself and my husband's birthday because I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I signed up for a three month trial.   There are two big negatives that I encountered:  The first was that Kindle Fire can only play videos.  It was really frustrating that the video you are looking at is what you see on your TV screen, not what you are watching on a Kindle.  The second was that my screen is pretty small compared to most other tablets.  A larger screen would have been much more comfortable to read.  I got this for my husband because he is trying to be more productive and he likes to read on his tablet, but he just hates that he can't play videos on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Lenovo A540 laptop (16GB) in August 2016. A couple of months later, I received a notice from Lenovo that they were removing my warranty because the screen was cracked. I immediately went to the Lenovo web site to cancel the warranty. The website suggested that I buy a new laptop. I took the laptop to a Lenovo sales associate and he advised that the laptop needed to be sent back to Lenovo. I did not want to do this so I went ahead and purchased a new Lenovo A610 laptop, which I use now.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a good product, it's well built and I think you get what you pay for. The speakers are the only thing I've found that were really bad, but for the money I'm happy with it. I've heard some decent things about the speakers, and the speakers themselves are really nice. However, my only other complaint is that they use a bad microphone, and that's really the only drawback.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product is of very good quality and is well made. The design is excellent. However the display screen is a bit small. The microphone is not very good. The screen size and size of the screen are small. Other than that this is a great product.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not as good as it should have been... The screen is good, the sound quality is pretty good, but the app is so slow, it takes over 10-15 minutes for a voice message to pop up, then it takes an additional 5-10 seconds for the message to appear on the screen. So if you don't like that slow reply you probably won't get many messages. The mic is so-so. The only thing I like about the product is that the screen is removable. The USB port is also nice. ,    Review Summary:  "This device is a good looking gadget, but it's not as good to use as it claims to be. I was hoping for a better microphone but it was still quite a bit better than most of the cheap mics I've tried. The app is okay but I prefer to use the phone app for messages since it does the trick. Other features such as a good camera are not included so for a low price this is pretty awesome."
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is not a review of an item, but a review, of the people who buy this product. I purchased my Kindle from Amazon. I have used the Kindle for the last year. This is my third review, and my first review on Amazon. It was purchased about a month ago, and I'm so disappointed. I was looking forward to the price for a full size e-reader (Kindle Fire) because I was going to save some money on shipping, since I'm not a heavy user of the Kindle app. I'm a heavy reader, and don't do the app. But, I was so excited about the full size, because I have read several books in the Kindle format, including the first two Kindle books I purchased (my Kindle Touch, and the Kindle Voyage). I do have a few small things that I have to work out with this e-book reader. I bought a hard copy of the book "The Little Prince" in a paperback, which cost me a whopping $28, which is very expensive (that's a lot for a book). I know I'm spending too much on the Kindle, since it's not a cheap reader, but I'm trying to stay within the budget. I also have an e-ink book reader that I've been using, and that costs me about $30. So, I'm thinking if I purchase the Kindle in the same size, and price, that I won't have to do too much shopping. I don't have any problems with the Amazon site. I know the shipping is expensive, but, it doesn't make me feel bad when I purchase my products. I've got a lot of stuff in the warehouse, and a lot more to buy, so I'm happy to order through Amazon, and get the product, within a week, and be happy with the product. Well, it arrived the day after I ordered it, but it took 2 weeks to get to my address. I live in Georgia, and Amazon had to ship it out from California. I wish it was faster, but they don't seem to want to ship outside of their local area. So my family and I have been frustrated. I really wanted a book reader for my Kindle, and have been looking for a good one. The Kindle is very small, it can hold a lot, but you have to be careful not to get anything in the bottom. The paper back doesn't stick to anything,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used to love my iPod and then I bought the original iPod Touch. I am in the process of giving that back now. I hate using the new iPod Touch, it just makes the whole iPod experience worse, especially as it is a case, the case is a pain in the ass. I use the new iPad a lot more than the old iPod because it has a nice screen, more battery life and it has better speakers.   My iPad has not had any issues with it and I am happy with the purchase of this case.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new iPhone SE from walmart after looking at dozens of options on the market, and after reading reviews on other users' experience with the phone, and how difficult it is to find an "Apple quality" Apple product on the web, I was extremely skeptical when my friend said he was buying a new phone. At first glance the phone appeared to be "the iPhone with a keyboard" but the screen is very dim and barely able to be seen on a bright sunny day. Also, the power button is hard to press even though the phone is plugged in, and the button is so stiff that it requires two pushes to be used. The other complaint I have about this phone is that it is just plain hard to turn on and use. The speaker is very quiet and very easy to hear (even with the earbuds in my ears), and the microphone on the front is not so great. I have a second Apple iPhone that is twice the price and twice the capability, and I find myself using my SE more than my second device.    Read full review

When i started using my iphones as watch it seemed like a big step back. The phone doesn't have that much screen real estate, it's too big and feels small, it has horrible battery life (5-6 hours), it just has no fun. If you want the best bang for your buck in an android and need the best battery life, buy the iphoney or an ips.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In this day and age, there is no reason to buy an inexpensive cell phone at any price. This was not good, or even good for a "beginner" cell phone. For the price, you can get a much better device for a far better price.

You can't feel the switches when you press them and that is very annoying.

Pros: Â Affordable, compact, good sound quality Cons:  The unit has a great feature - it connects to your computer through a USB cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this computer because it was advertised as being powerful and well-suited for college students. I have been very disappointed. While it is not on par with the Intel processors in my old Dell, it's definitely on par. That being said, I don't use my laptop as often as my previous one. The battery life is terrible. You can't expect more than six hours of use on a battery that only holds about a half of a charge. The only way this thing works is when you use it in a "standby" mode, which I guess is meant to keep the screen on at all times. In my experience, the screen goes dark for about a second, at which point the computer shuts down. You've got to restart it manually, and when you do, the battery life isn't even close to being able to make it through a full day of heavy use. I'm surprised this thing even made it out the door at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     In the year 2005, we did some extensive research on the "magic" behind the electronic device, and we came up with some very surprising conclusions about the device:  - the "magical" effects that the device supposedly offered (we call these "effects") were actually very modest and very obvious  1. It did not offer any significant and significant magical powers whatsoever.  2. It was a really pretty piece of glass  3. It really doesn't help the poor when the device breaks  4. It does a lot of really terrible things: , such as causing people to get more stressed out and depressed  5. It is very harmful to the environment  6. It's a waste of valuable time  7. People have bad experiences with it, including bad experiences in the future  8. It can even cause a serious medical condition. , including: seizures, brain injuries, and other physical problems  9. It causes emotional problems in some people  10. There are many, many other effects. And we can only assume the same goes for other electronic devices.  this is NOT a "magnetic field." this is not "magnetism." this does not "work" or "do something" at all.  the term "magiconomy" has become a common synonym for the term, although in many cases the term has been applied to a variety of devices that are, technically speaking, nothing more than a "gizmo". this is just a "thing."  the term "electric" in the phrase "magic device" has been used to describe a variety things: a variety a kind of electrical charges.  of course, this does NOT mean that the magnetic field itself does NOT affect an electrical charge. but for those of us who study magnetism we know that all electricity is electromagnetic in nature. the "field" is just the electrical properties of the charges. there is no "field effect." you do NOT "get" a magnetic field. you DO "get the field." it doesn't do anything for you.  in fact, the magnetic effect on an electrical charges is probably MUCH more important that the "electronic" effect. the electric effect is "just an electric field" and not "the field itself." that is what most people "know" when they hear the term. - there is nothing "magically"

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got this I was surprised that the touch buttons didn't work at first. My first order arrived with a dead touch screen and a dead power supply, the second one I received with a working touch screen but still with a power supply that wouldn't work. The touch screen itself is good. When you do anything on the touch screen it actually works, and the buttons aren't as annoying as they appear at first and they do make the device look good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound is bad on this thing. It can't even be heard on most mp3s because it sounds like it is being played over a speaker.   It has no USB port but there is a micro sd card port that supports up to 32 gb of space.  The screen is nice and big and bright enough for the screen.  I bought this thinking that it would be great for home use because of its size and the fact that it runs off of mains. But I have not really used it yet.  It doesn't have any power save or sleep modes.  This is just a dumbed down version of a computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this from Walmart because it was advertised as working with the iPhone. I have been searching and searching for an app that does what this does and have come up with nothing. I'm now stuck with this and it will continue to drain my battery. I'll be looking for a better product next.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Tommie from Bad experience This is the worst gadget I ever owned. There are 3 different modes for a good speaker. When I put this on the top the volume will stay where it was when I turned it on. When it's turned off the volume goes down to nothing. This is horrible, because I didn't realize that the first thing I did when I plugged in was turn it on first. You can't even hear that you have it on when you turn it off. My biggest complaint is that you can't change the speaker type. You must buy a new speaker cable and set it up. You will never go back to this gadget. It should just be removed. . I had to purchase the 3d wireless speaker as well to use the phone. It is not a bad sound. It was a good set of speakers. This will not replace the phone but it will be a replacement to my old speakers. I bought the speaker on sale to replace my old speaker that I still use. My old speaker is a $80 speaker with a microphone and a little sound in it. This $90 speaker can't hold a conversation and it doesn't have the features of my old one. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is new to cell phones. The phone has some nice features for a phone. My only gripe is that I wish I could have a little bluetooth speaker built in the phone so that I could use my phone in my car. I also have to say that the speaker is very hard to turn on and off because of the small hole in the side where the switch is. It's like the whole phone is turning on when I try to turn it down. I don't know if the speaker needs to be made a little bigger but in my opinion this speaker just needs to get some more features in it to make it a better phone speaker. Rated 5 out of5 by mike from Works perfect Bought this for a birthday gift. Works perfect! Great sound for an old phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love it.   The remote is very simple to use.  The unit has great range and you can find the nearest phone booth or coffee shop on your map and pick it up quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I use it all the time:  The V-Ray HDX is a great device for getting the information you need. It is very easy to use, and I can even change the software.  It has worked great for me, and it's a great deal. This is the only V-ray device I will ever buy.  This is my second V-rays; I purchased the HD-RX in August 2007, and my first V-RAY was the HDX back in February 2005. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      "The keyboard is so uncomfortable, my arms have begun to ache. The touchpad is also rather clunky and lacks a good way to do the "button up" or "button down" functions. The trackpad is a little flimsy and difficult to find the correct function."   Overall, the device is great. I like its looks. The sound is good, too.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A poor design is a bad design, but I think this one really is.   I received this to replace my old iMac, which had an old plastic case that was very flimsy and easy to break (a friend gave me her old Mac because she had problems with it before). The other day I took my Mac apart and found the hard drive connector was glued in wrong and the motherboard was badly assembled.  The LCD had lots of dust inside, so I had to take it apart to clean it. But when I took the LCD off the new one broke immediately: I was very frustrated. I called Apple Care Support and they said the new unit would be replaced because it was defective (in the same part). They told me to just send it back and get a new one, which I did. But then I discovered that the original screen and buttons were actually the same buttons. They just used a different part. The original iMac had some issues (a screen not being perfectly flat), but it worked fine. The new model is not designed as a replacement for your original iMAC, it's designed to replace a broken device. That doesn't mean it's a bad device. It's a perfectly good replacement for a broken iMac screen (I think it's the only iMac that will work with an HD video card). The buttons work perfectly, and the LCD screen works fine.  But the whole thing is poorly assembled and feels cheaply made. It looks like somebody took a $400 iMac and put together a $200 one.  As a result, the iMac now sits around $150 to make up the cost of the parts and labor I had it serviced for.  I have to say that I would not recommend this iMac for people who want to spend $500-1000 on an upgrade.  There are better computers available now for about $200 to $300.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was impressed when I first tried this product, because I have a few items that I really really really need, that I can't find anywhere. But, they are just too expensive. And, my money is going to waste on items I already know I will need.   It is a great idea to have a way to keep track of your stuff, but, the way it is designed does not work for my needs, because:  This is not a way of storing items at home, it is a way for you to keep an electronic notebook.  It keeps a note in a magnetic strip, but the strip is small and can easily get lost, so that you can't use it to store important items like a cell phone or important correspondence.  The magnetic strip is very easy to lose, so you can never remember which item you are working on. The other problem with this product is that if you have to put the items back, it takes quite a while, but it would be better if you could print a QR code of the item, and use that instead of keeping a printed item, because the printed item is easy to replace. If you want to use this for storing important items, and you want a convenient way to do so, I would recommend using something like an Apple product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My phone is awful. The phone is very large, has a really nice screen and is super comfortable to use. It's so small that I almost forgot it was there. I am having a hard time getting the apps I need to work, but that's not a problem. The worst is the battery. It lasts about 4 hours, but then when you turn it off it shuts off automatically. I have to charge the phone every night, even if I am going to bed. The charger will last a few hours. So what do you get when you buy a really great phone and then an awful battery? A phone that is not that great, and a bad charger. This is not a good phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My first experience with a Sony Vaio e-book reader and it is not a good one. The reader doesn't open and close on its own, I have to open and reopen it just to read a single page. Not only is the reader unresponsive but the quality of the screen, which can be described as a cheap-looking, dirty display, is horrible and the reading experience is quite bad. I was hoping that the Sony would offer an e-reader with a full-color, LED screen but it looks as if it has been made in the 1970s. The screen is so low quality and dull, you can see the screen as if you are holding it at arm's length. The only saving grace are the fonts and the formatting options and this is a great step up from the Apple iBook and Nook readers which are also available. I recommend this reader, the one I bought has a decent display but has an LCD backlight and a good battery life, a nice bonus.   Sony VaIO e-Reader Review:  The Best Readable eReader of the Year! I'm sure you know the story by now about Sony. They're a maker of cheap tablets and some of the best cameras on the planet. They also produce very good high-end digital cameras. Then they went and created a new category of e-readers and I'm fairly certain that a lot of people didn't know that there was even an ereader category. I guess this is why you see a lot more Sony products in Best Buy stores now. For all you people who bought one of the last generation of ebooks you can get the latest version of the Sony Vaiolo E-reader.  The Sony Vaime e-Book Reader is just what it seems to be, a digital version of an ebook reader. You can read ebooks on your laptop, tablet or phone. It has full-screen e-text options. It can read text on the back of a book. It's also got a built-in scanner which allows you to convert books to e-books. The Sony Vaion e-Readers can also scan ebooks to and from your iPod. Sony's e-reading software also comes with a few more features. For example, you'll have a built in translator that reads words and letters when you speak them, and it can even read out of the air when you've turned off the ambient light. It
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I went to go get an iPhone 7 and I went in with my current iPhone 6s and I was told that I will not be able to use the phone with my iPhone 6 due to the glass back being broken, I had no reason to expect that, so I called and the person I spoke to told me I had to wait another week for my phone to come in and when it did I would get it fixed, I asked why and she said that Apple didn't take care of their products, then I had my iPhone sent to Apple as a replacement, they didn't even fix my iPhone!   Just for fun:  It has the most impressive battery life I've ever seen.   It has the best display I've seen, I'm not a huge fan of OLED but it is really nice. I love the fingerprint sensor on the front, it's the easiest way to unlock the phone, but I have to admit I have always used the Apple fingerprint sensor instead of using my fingerprint on the back.  In Conclusion:  I love it and I wish the other phone makers would start designing their own smartphones, it would save a lot of money and time.  This phone is a must have for any Apple fans who like their phones to have a lot going for it!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is a device that could be made into a very good one by adding some extra parts to the existing design. But they didn't add any. If this is your first electronic device, then it is good to know that this one has to be cleaned often.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The SDR-1000's are the best.   I purchased this after having been using an analog receiver and was impressed by the sound quality.  I'm using an AT-5 antenna on a UHF band in a window, so I was a little apprehensive about using the SDR in the open. I haven't encountered any trouble so far.  The sensitivity is really good - perfect for a receiver on an aircraft!  It can operate on UHF up to 13.8 MHz, but if the weather is bad, I've found I need a bit of an amplifier to get the full bandwidth of the receiver.  I have one problem with this unit - the power supply can sometimes not get all the power it needs, sometimes it has to turn on and off twice for a few seconds - just turn it on and it will work.  Overall, excellent product and a very good deal.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works fine for what it is (an electronic device to connect to a computer), but when it comes to the price it is simply ridiculous. The product came in a little box that was basically a plastic bag and that is the way it will be stored in your refrigerator for the next 5 years.  Â I had to take it apart and disassemble it to make the connection to my computer so that I could start to learn to use it.  It also took me almost 2 months of trying to find an adapter to get the power to the computer.  And I did not receive the adapter until well after I purchased the device!   Also, when I connect the device to the cable to my printer, it turns on and starts printing for me.  When I try to connect the printer, but don't have a working computer, it says "Sorry, we don't support printer devices yet."   So my printer wouldnt print.  I had to wait 2 weeks before my printer could be connected to it!  Finally I have a nice computer and no need to spend so much money on an electronic device.  My negative review of the product:  I have had this printer for a little over a week and only have 2 problems with it:  It has a "sleep" function that when you go to bed it shuts off the power.  You have to turn it on again before you sleep.  The power button is also a little hard to find.  After reading the description on the site I had high expectations.  Everything was perfect until I had 2 problems:  The price is too high (I pay for my printer out of pocket).  The adapter is NOT cheap.  My printer is not very large, about 2 feet by 3.5 feet.  A 5 inch adapter should be about $5.00 but the "extra" one was $11.00 for 2.  These are the only 2 problems I have with this printer.  If you need a cheap printer I guess this is the printer for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If it were a new item that you'd bought a while ago and it broke or you got it as a gift, you would still recommend it. The problem is that I've had the same exact phone for four years now, and it never even once failed on me. So what the heck is going on here?   The reason why this phone failed so miserably is simple. The battery is a garbage piece of junk. I've got it in my pocket all day and it's drained like a sledgehammer every fifteen minutes. It's barely usable in the winter, and if I put it in a bag, it just sits there taking up space with a huge lump of old plastic. All the extra stuff, like the charger, the USB charger, and the battery itself just ends up making this device even more unusable in my pockets. I really wish that Samsung would fix this problem and provide a proper warranty for the battery.   Another thing I have to say is that this phone has absolutely terrible service from Samsung. I recently had the phone replaced after the battery started dying. The replacement phone was sent back to the factory and, after two months, it arrived with only the original battery. My replacement phone arrived within a day and the batteries were already in and ready to go. I can't tell you how much money I wasted trying to figure out how this happened.  Posted by Steve at 4:30 AM I don't have a problem with this phone. It is a solid phone that is durable and has a good screen. It has a lot of good features and is easy to use. However, for me, it lacks a couple of features I really would have liked (besides the microSD slot). The first is that the camera is terrible. It takes awful pictures and if you don't care about the pictures then I wouldn't recommend this phone if you need a camera. The second feature that I really don't like is that when you press the volume down button in portrait mode, it takes you to the home screen. I find it to be very inconvenient, and I would prefer a button that goes straight to the apps screen or the menu. However I think these two features are okay for certain situations, and don't bother me too much. Overall I think that this is a very good phone that has a few drawbacks and one major plus.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an absolute failure from a technical and design standpoint. This product will never be worth more than $150. I bought one, and I regret it. It is very simple to use. The main problem is that the unit is designed with such a high resolution sensor, it produces a very noisy image, which makes it useless for the purpose that it is being sold for. I think this is a great example of a product that was designed with high resolution, but then failed to meet the expectations that it was created for. The unit also uses a non-standard battery connection, which could be a problem if the unit breaks. So, in the end, the $150 price tag for the device and a battery that is so expensive that it has to be sold as a part of a large-scale set of electronic components is a joke. Don't buy it. If you have to buy this product, ask for a refund and replace the bad unit.  Rated 1 out of 5 by johng1 from BOMBSHELL The B&H listing says this is an accurate color reference for digital camera sensor and the packaging says this and a picture on the back shows the colors in the camera. They also include a link to the color space on this site that will let you convert it to sRGB (this is the color system used by most of the consumer electronic devices). But the page does not include any information for what to do. So it's the color model, then a link for the conversion, and then a picture that shows the original color and the result in sRGB. How on earth can that be true? I cannot find any information on the website that would help me convert my device from sRGB to another color space. This is a complete failure, and they should be ashamed of themselves.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My husband and I just bought a new tablet and we are so impressed. Everything about the product was great except the screen. The screen is very good but the color saturation is bad and so is the clarity. It is sooooo clear and very bright but it really hurts when you are typing on the screen! We had a great experience when we purchased the phone. We were so excited when the device came. The customer service was top notch. The delivery time was great as well. We are very happy with our purchase. One thing that stood out to us the most is how quickly our order arrived. I was skeptical when we signed for the order but the man that helped me signed for it for me and then he brought it to me. The way he helped me sign for the package was the best! I felt like I was helping him and was able to give a much better opinion of the device than when I received it myself. I will be doing business with T-Mobile again!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm a fan of a lot of electronic devices, but this one has so many problems that I don't recommend it to any other owner of an iDevice.  The screen is terrible and the battery life sucks.  I also bought one of the "touchless" phones, but the battery runs out before I get to the store, and I have to be in my car with it charging when I get there (it works on the way back!).  There's no way to adjust the volume on the phone.  There is also a huge difference between the "unlock" feature in iOS7 and the one in iOS8 (it just shows the phone as locked), which makes using the phone a nightmare.   For that reason, I'm stuck with the iMac, which is a little more usable.  It has the same problems.  I own two iPhones    And my   The iMac is the best iDevice   for me, but if you're thinking of getting this, I recommend getting the iWifi version instead (which has less issues).  I bought one before the "new iPad" came out.  That thing is crap, especially if you want the retina display and a high resolution for a $400 device.  Also, the iWidget is still terrible and a waste of money.  Â  This is the first "tablet" I've owned   Â   The only good thing about this   is that I haven't had any problems with the phone's touchless features.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I'm on a mission to get my family of five (3,8,3,2 and 6 months old) to learn how to use an e-reader. My son (now 4 years old) was not interested in reading when he was younger. He said he wanted to look at pictures when he learned to read. I decided to buy a Kindle because I thought it would make learning easier for him, but as it turned out, it's just a distraction... he likes to play on it instead of read. The only way I know how to get him to sit still is to put him to bed at night. I'm not a fan of the cover design. It is very bright and colorful, and the font is way too large. The price is really a good deal..."   - M.C., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  "I had been interested in getting a Kindle for a while but due to time constraints (I have 4 kids) I didn't have the money to get one. I looked on Amazon (after finding out there was a sale on it) and found the Kindle Touch in a 16gb version for only $150. I couldn't pass it up! It's pretty amazing just how much you can read. And even though it doesn't use paper, it still looks really great. I did have one issue with it. My oldest (4 years old at the time) was struggling to figure out how to scroll to the right. I was able to get it to work by teaching her how to "hover" with the thumb. This works very well and it is so much easier than the mouse.  The device is pretty bright and looks great in my bedroom and in the living room. It's great when the kids are in bed and can't find the page.    The only issue I have with the device is that when I put it into my car and turn the screen off, it will still be showing you the page you were on. But I can scroll to any other page without changing pages.   I did read that one of the buttons on the device might need to be changed, so that would be a good purchase. That is probably the only issue, but otherwise I love my Kindle. If only I could read it with my phone.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A couple of years ago I had a Samsung Galaxy Note II. It was awful! Very heavy and slow. The battery was drained within a couple of days. I bought the Motorola Droid 4 instead and it was a very good experience. A great camera and really nice screen. Unfortunately the software is still not as good as the Samsung Galaxy line. The only way to get any updates is to send out your phone to be rooted. I'm sure many other people have the same problem. The new Galaxy Note 3 has a nice new interface, faster processor and a great screen. The problem I have with it is the interface. It is so simple and easy to use. It has just too many icons and buttons. If I want to search something, I have to open the Google search app. I want the apps to load faster than on the old Note. A positive review on an iPhone:  When it comes to apps, I am a very power user. Most of the time, I use the apps myself. But, if I need something done quickly, I can't live without a good backup system. I know a couple who have iPhones, and they do most of their communication through the Apple iMessage system. It's amazing how much time you save by having a backup system like that. I also love having a full screen keyboard on the iPhone. There is no reason not to use one. I like to have my apps in the sidebar so I can easily navigate to them and quickly open them. But sometimes it's annoying having a huge screen to read. And, there is also the issue of apps not being able to run in a window size. It would be so nice to use a fullscreen app so I could open it on the edge of my screen and have it look the way I want it to. Conclusion: Â I think I've said enough about my opinion on this device. I have had it for about a month and it still has a lot of growing to do. I still don't like the Samsung TouchWiz interface, but I still find myself using it quite a bit. This is the only phone I have bought this year that I don't use every day. The phone is light on battery life, but if you have no data plan, then I think you will be fine. I recommend this to everyone that likes a phone with a full-size keyboard, but also wants some software updates.

I had heard good things about the other brand I looked at and decided to get this one for her. It's easy to set up, easy to connect, great sound and it comes with an iPad charger so she can work on it anywhere. I got a little concerned at first when she started it, but once she figured out the steps to use it it worked great. It works great in my room because it's tall and my tv's speakers won't cause it to get too loud, but as long as she keeps it in her bedroom or in her parents room, it's fine.

My wife took the phone to a local repair center and they said they could not repair the phone because it was a trade-in.  It is also running hot in the back, so I think I got a lemon. I bought a refurbished unit from LG.  They said it was not a trade in.  When it arrived, it was only about a month old and it still had the problems. I'm not trying to give LG bad marks but my phone died on me and I could have had a new one.  Posted by Chris at 10:41 AM Hi All I am very interested in upgrading to an LG G5 (E8500), but I don't want a G3+. I would be happy with a G2 and have had one for many years, but it just won't do the job. I just found out that the S5 is also a G5, so can I buy a S5, trade in an E8500 and get a G7? The G5 is the one on my wishlist, but I want a phone that won't get too hot, is water resistant, and that has a removable battery (G2 did not) Also, what is the "best of" list that the site lists for the G3/G5? Reply Delete Hi: I'm glad you are getting ready to upgrade and looking for new technology. I will get back to you as I understand more about the G5. Delete Good news. I found the first review was by someone who had to get the phone from a reseller. If you want to have a real device (LG), go ahead. The phone should arrive on its own. This site is very helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased my first electronic item (batteries for my cell phone) from this site.   The first day the batteries came I tried to recharge them (the charging cords were attached to the batteries)   Unfortunately the cords did not fit and the batteries burned up and the store was only able to replace them if I paid full price for a new set.  This store is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you're a geek who wants to see the new devices or is a gadget lover, you should buy these.    The reason they're getting 4 stars is because they're really difficult to install. When I bought the new iPad, I got the free trial. I installed it the next day, but when I tried to turn it on, I only got a black screen. No Apple logo, nothing. I was so disappointed, I bought it again.  As far as reliability goes, the iPad's are pretty decent but with the price difference between them and the older devices, you can't justify spending a few hundred dollars on something that just won't last. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this laptop a month ago, and I'm pretty excited about this computer. I purchased it for my daughter to use for schoolwork. I'm sure she will get good use out of it, but I don't think she will like it because it's small and doesn't look as nice as the other laptops her classmates have. It's a very solid and well made computer, but it's a little difficult to carry in a bag since it's so small. I recommend it, however, if you want a relatively small, reliable computer for your child who loves schoolwork but doesn't want to lug around a huge, clunky laptop.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a very nice Sony DSC-RX100. It's a camera and video recorder. It is a great piece of kit, very smooth operation, easy to use and with the option to record to any SD card. But the audio quality is very disappointing. The internal microphone is terrible. The audio quality only comes across when using the external microphone and that's not the microphone I was looking for. So I was disappointed and sold on my camera. I'm waiting for a new one and hoping the quality improves.   So my camera is now in a box and it will never see the light of day again. I will never be using it and will probably never purchase a Sony product.  No more Sony and I'm never taking another product or giving another Sony product a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     For many years, we were very satisfied with the Sennheiser MX7/8 earphones. Unfortunately, the recent product update for the S9/X line has caused us great concern. With the S4 and X2 models, the S7/X earphones had very fine sound, with excellent clarity, and an overall superb presentation. The problem with the X2 and the X4 is that the mids have become much less detailed and the highs have become a little "crisp", resulting in a somewhat less-than-optimal sound. The S9 and X4 appear to have gone to a "slightly more detailed" midrange, and a much-less-clear sound than the original version. If you own a pair of S9, or an S4, the sound you'll get is much different than with the original S4/X models.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my mother who has epilepsy, she loves her ipad but the touchscreen is so glitchy and not responsive, even on a cold winter day the touchscreen still is not working, I have emailed Apple twice since I bought it but they have not responded to me at all. If Apple has the capability of making such a great product and if it is so much cheaper than the ipad I own, then I'd gladly spend the extra $15 to get a better screen! I don't want this to be used to pay rent!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The worst. The bottom falls off the socket when you put the device down and it is only there to save your money. A shame because it has a good amount of battery life. But then you realize how expensive the battery is. I was using the battery for 2 years before I realized it was not worth the extra money.  Rated 1 out of 5 by C_D from Good thing I had just bought this to replace an aging laptop, but it was a miserable experience... I used it for 3 months and then had to return it because the keyboard was cracking in half and the battery was almost completely dead. The keyboard was still in good working order and I think the other 3 months of use was probably due to a defective part that was in the packaging. , it would be a good buy, but if I were going to buy this again I would be cautious, and perhaps only use it when absolutely necessary. Also, since you are using it for 2 more years from the date you bought it, I would definitely take the extra precautions.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was the only product I bought from this company. It worked perfectly, until the day I turned it on. This product was supposed to be a simple charger. Instead of an on/off switch, it has a battery indicator, a light and a buzzer.   The LED lights up in red and the buzzer is a siren.  I am not going to pay $40 for a product that I can purchase from a reputable manufacturer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was not very good, especially for the price.  I ordered the "mini" version of it because my wife wanted a smaller, cheaper, less flashy device for the tv. It has great picture quality but the build quality and function is not that great. It also takes a lot of space, about the same as my tv. My wife really does not like it that much.   My wife loves it though.  She has a tv set at her parents house that looks just like the one i bought and she just bought it for the mini version of the tv (so it doesn't have the same cable problem)  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you have a problem with your new electronic device or you have not gotten your money's worth and it doesn't work, do not buy it!   And don't be afraid to send it back if you don't like the results.   I can promise you that if you try a different brand than the one that you have, the results will be better.  In fact, in my experience, it is not uncommon for a new e-book reader to work out very well for a short period of time, then for the software to crash completely, and the machine to turn itself off.  The main problem is that you may need to re-install the driver if your device becomes faulty.  You may have other problems that need fixing, too, such as a faulty hard drive.  If your device starts to give you trouble, read the user manual.  Do not buy anything unless you know the product has been tested by reputable experts. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I ordered this at the very last minute on the last minute and it arrived after a couple days. I was really excited to open it up when I got home but...the case was cracked. It had already been opened to remove the plastic and it was really gross. The front was all cracked, the screen was bent and had a bunch of little dents all over it and the plastic cover for the front was ruined. The screen was unusable. The headphone jack was also completely destroyed. I don't want to buy another one of these for my kids' use. I wish I had ordered the original Samsung version.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Paddy from Great for my home I bought this as a replacement for the older Galaxy Tab 3 (4) which my husband loved but which got very hot and would quickly go cold. This is a much better deal because it has better display quality (although it's not quite as sharp as the 4). The battery lasts longer but this is a very nice feature. The fingerprint scanner is also great, and there are a number of third party apps that let you use Google services like Play Music and Maps. It has some issues with software updates, which I understand is a problem with new software.  of 3 found this review helpful. Was it helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device to use with my laptop because I have two laptops and need a USB device for the desktop computer. I bought a device that is rated for USB 2.0, but I didn't notice that this device can only be used with USB 2 devices. So this device is not recommended for use with USB 3 devices. It also does not support 3D. I'm a graphic designer, and I found myself losing work because I didnÂ´t have time to fix it. The cable is very short. I also used this device with a computer and found it extremely confusing. The device itself does what it says it does, but the software is just horrible. I use this product on a 3 year old system, but this software was just awful. There are so many issues with it I couldn't help but wonder what happened to the people who designed the product.    Write a positive review about an excellent product:  The product is a must for my family who do not use USB ports. We use the MacBook Pro as the main machine and it is always a problem to plug and unplug cables. I was using the usb 3 port in my old laptop but the USB 2 port on my new MacBook Pro was just too short. But, with the USB 3 port on the new computer, I was able to connect my old USB 2 cables with ease.  What I really like about this product: The product works perfect and is very lightweight. There is no risk of the product being damaged and the device is very easy to connect to computers. I am very happy with it and my wife and kids love it too.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Rated 5 out of 5   I have been wanting to buy a digital meter for years and finally got around to it. I do not use a meter. My primary meter was an old digital one from around 70's. It had some serious issues with the meter being unstable and unreliable. I don't know how they made the new meter and it looks like the old one was fine. I am impressed so far. It can be tricky at first. I set it to take readings with a "true" value. I know it reads low because I read the readings at home with a good old analog meter and they're often under 5.5 when I'm not expecting them to be that low and I know I can trust the meter because the readings are taken by a reliable device. The readings can be very low sometimes. The software doesn't have much to show at the moment. I think the real deal is the new digital technology. The old analog meters were a great piece of equipment, but had a few issues with accuracy. They had a "false positive" meaning if the meter read less than 5.0 the instrument was not calibrated correctly (sometimes called "fudged" readings), so I always knew something was wrong because I got a false positive. With the digital meter I can know if I'm getting low readings but I still have to correct for a few errors because the meter is not perfect and is not completely accurate. But overall I am very satisfied with this new unit and would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only problem I had was that the keyboard was very hard to use ( I can't even type correctly without hitting the space bar), so I was going to buy a different one that was "rubber-type" because I heard they are a lot more comfortable than the standard type. Also, it doesn't come with a key-set so I had to buy them separately from a different computer store. I think the only redeeming quality to this is that I purchased mine through a third party retailer. So, I do have a chance to get one without having to pay the full price. But, as I mentioned before, if you want a keyboard that is "rubbery" (because it's not aluminum) then this isn't the right one for you. It's a good keyboard, but I wouldn't buy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In a nutshell:  The first thing that came to my mind when I saw this item was the price. It's $70.   This unit is supposed to work with all the major PC's out there, but that wasn't the case for me.  First, this thing doesn't even recognize the system I'm trying to hook it up to.  Then I discovered that the buttons on the front side are useless, you just press one and it does nothing.  Finally, it has no "switch", which means that if you turn on and off your PC, it will keep on turning on and on.  To me, that is a really bad sign.  It seems that many people are looking for a $70 unit, but I just can't see how this works with a PC that doesn't come with a power cord.  The Bad:  - The case has no vents in it, so it's pretty hot in there.  - I've never used an audio device that has no switch.  There is a lot of noise when the unit is in use.  Also, the unit has two batteries in it.  Not enough to get through a full work day.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am going to let you know that i'm sorry i ordered this item. My wife wanted me to go with this over a more expensive one. The device started to fail after a month of use. It took about two weeks for it to completely shut down. I called to see if they could send me a new one and they wouldn't. They said it was defective so they sent me a store credit. I returned the device and bought this one from this company for a good deal.   Pros:   Fast & Easy to Install I recently ordered a new iPad for my son to use with a program he was learning to code for school.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   In order to get all this hardware, you have to pay $2,500 plus shipping to get the computer and a set of cables. The sound is also not that great. The bass is OK but it's way to soft and mushy.   In addition, the speakers are not that good for a small box.  The screen is very small, even compared to an android tablet.  I don't know if the price will drop after the release but i will be holding off until it does.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got my Galaxy S3 because I like Samsung and because they had a great reputation, but after I got this thing I'm never going to use a Samsung again.   The only good thing about this thing is that it's a micro SD card reader and the other thing is, it costs way too much money.  The Galaxy S4 is a lot cheaper at $549, but it's not that much better than the Galaxy S2 either.  It has a 3.5mm jack which is really nice.  With the adapter for the headphones, it has a 2.5 jack, which works but not really great.  There are also some really crappy battery life problems.  I used to get around 100-120 hours of normal use out of it but recently I used it a little more and it's down to 80% now.  You can't really plug in this thing, so I have to use two adapters or connect it to a Mac or PC.  This thing is awful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got my G6, I thought I was about to spend the money on an amazing piece of engineering, but I ended up getting a box of junk.   This is the same model that comes in a 2-pack with a broken screen, broken camera, and a cracked keyboard.  The screen is cracked too.  When trying to use the keyboard it won't turn on and won't even recognize the button.  I would not recommend this item at all.  Update:  My G6 is back up and running great!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I would have to say that the Kobo e-reader has an extremely high level of user experience.   For this reason, if it were me I would have bought one a long time ago.  To be honest, I have nothing but good things to say about the K6.  It is so compact, easy to set up and take apart, fast and has an ultra long battery life for its size and quality.  My only complaint about the battery life is that the screen does get a bit warm when reading for more than a couple of hours.  So I had a little trouble getting used to how the screen heats up.  The only time when I've had any problems with my e-ink books is when I forgot to change the battery, or when my Kindle has lost the connection to my device.  These two occurrences are fairly rare, but still annoying.  For these reasons, if you are looking for an e-Reader for someone who doesn't have a lot of room in their room or is just looking for a simple, inexpensive device, the K7 is a great alternative.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A great idea, but too few features for me. If I could change one thing, I'd change the USB port to be micro USB, instead of the usual type-A. I'd also change the port to micro USB. That way I can charge my other phones, tablets, and cameras via my phone using my laptop. Also, the design of the USB-C port is just not very well thought out. If you need a micro USB port, you will need an adapter that adds a separate adapter to your laptop (it's a standard type-C USB adapter). I would strongly recommend avoiding this. Also the display is pretty small. The phone looks better, but the screen is not very bright or crisp. It's fine if you're just using it for checking e-mail, but don't expect to use it much. You can't tell the difference in my opinion between my Galaxy S7 edge and this one. If your looking for a great phone, I think this one is a good option. But be aware of the size limitations and be prepared for an adapter to go with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new iPhone 6s last week and the battery was dead by the end of the day.

I can't imagine a time when I don't have it.  the only thing I don,t understand is when it can be charged with an adapter it says it can't charge with usb cables, is this a con that the unit cannot be charged via a usb cable? or was I just missing that information. it can charge via a mains outlet or usb. 1) The battery compartment isn't flush. 2) It is impossible to charge this thing via usb. I have tried charging it via usb cable and it will not charge. I don' t understand why, when you have all the right connectors on the box. 3) I didn't like that it was made out of plastic and not aluminum. 4) The buttons feel pretty cheap but if you use one you should be ok. It has a soft button and you'll know when you push it. Overall good product. 6 Stars   Excellent device. Highly recommend. .

This was one of those products where I have to say something about the product, but I am only rating it because I have two of these, and my opinion may be biased. I have no other negative comments to add.  If you have ever wanted to get a cheap digital music player from Japan that will play any format that your computer will recognize, then this product is for you. There are cheaper models on the market that are less than half the price, but the price of this unit is right in line with what you would expect to pay. It's not perfect, but this is a great unit that is definitely worth buying. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was hard to find a good source for these. I used to buy a brand new Samsung tablet from Best Buy for $200 (no comparison) and then a used Samsung Tab 2 from Target for $150. Now, I'm using a refurbished Acer Iconia Tab A8-886P for $300-400. The main issue with the new tablet is that it has a backlight that doesn't come on unless you turn it on and then off. This means that you can't do any screen lighting tricks like putting it in the dark, or using it for the night when it's time for bed. So I was planning to try and use it as a laptop and I just can't figure out how to do that. It will still work, but it won't have much of a screen. The second big issue is the keyboard. The keyboard on this one is the same one I'm currently using on my old Acer. It's not too bad, but some of the keys (like the F and S keys) are small and have really small print (about as big as the keys themselves) so you need to really tap them to hit them. Some keys aren't too bad (F5) but there is some annoying lag on the F6 and F7 keys. The F10 and F11 keys are fine. The big red square key is hard to hit without having to be really precise because it's not quite small enough for your palm. Also, there is the annoying buzzing sound when you type the letters and sometimes some of your letters don't even line up. It seems to be more of an issue on the higher end models. I could go on and on, but I'm just going to end with one more thing: I used the tablet on the highest settings and it was very very hot. The bottom left and right corners are very hot, especially if you hold it upside down. When I was trying to work on it, my hands felt like they were burning from the back of the tablet to the side. If you are expecting to use this on a desk, be prepared for your hands to sweat like crazy. The whole thing is not super big, but the back cover folds around it so that the bottom is basically the size of a credit card. I haven't had a chance to actually look at all of the ports on it yet, but they are pretty sparse. One thing I do like is the USB ports and HDMI ports

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So, you've found the best bluetooth speaker available today and it's a good one! However, you have a problem with it.   It's the battery, stupid.  I have a phone that doesn't need to charge at all.  If I were to go out on a limb, and say it's the lack of the battery charger that kills it. The other issue is that the bluetooth itself is a flop.  The speaker plays well for a few minutes, but then turns into a speakerphone.  There is no way to turn it off on the speaker itself, the screen still shows the phone number that will be used to connect to bluetooth, and if I had the battery with me when I did turn it on, it would be off, too.  Finally, the speaker is really heavy.  It weighs way too much and, like I said above, there's no way that this is a lightweight device.  In summary, I'd give this speaker one star if I could, but in my opinion, it's definitely a "1".  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am a very picky person. I have to have my iPhone for every conceivable purpose.    The only thing I want from it is for it to do everything I want.  Â The bottom line is that you don't have to use a cable for this phone   It does what it is suppose to do, and that's to be a phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are better tablets out there, but the Nexus 7 is pretty darn good for its price.   The only reason I gave this four stars is because of a few minor annoyances: 1. The camera is poor, although it does provide better detail in pictures than some tablets I've owned. 2. The backlight can't be turned off. 3. The Nexus 7 gets hot when it's playing HD video. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great monitor. Very happy with it. The screen is bright and the response time is fast. I've already replaced all my old monitors, and the screen is brighter, and a little better quality in some places. Not to mention that it looks really great with the bezel off.   In terms of picture, I can see a bit more detail, and there's a slight green shift in the picture. As for sound, it is very clear and very good. This was one of the first monitors that I purchased, and it was worth the money.   Best monitor for the price: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I bought this item and have been using it every day. I have to buy more for other parts of my home, as I'm very happy with my new tool. I was very impressed at the level of construction, but it does have its shortcomings. It will not hold screws or other small screws that would normally fall out of any other type of drill. Also, I use this on the outside of the house, and the inside (my bathroom) I used to buy the same kind of drill that this came in, so there was no way the plastic piece would slip out of the drill hole. So, I had to use a file to smooth the plastic, and then I used a piece of scrap wood to keep it in the hole. That's what you get for buying a more expensive drill, and paying twice as much as you need to. It's also a little bit difficult to push in the bits because it's got this little bump. If you want to drill inside your house or garage, I would recommend the 1/2 hp for that purpose only. I just can't recommend it as a general purpose drill.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I tried one of these as a portable charger. They worked, as far as I could tell.   It was easy to get into a good position and hold it upright while charging.  I used it for one day to charge a phone. It seems to have no issues with power or output at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery life is horrible and it's not worth it. I use this battery for my    iPhone   and the battery is the worst ever! I am using a   wireless   with 3g   that I can use to   email and   facebook and the connection is very weak   for me, I can't send a  email   I can only use it for   Twitter and Â  Instagram, if I have to use   Skype   on   my  iPhone, it's just   useless  .   The   iPad   is good enough   but it has a  phone   connection too.   It's not the same with   the   Apple  , It's the same but the difference is very big.  And the  iPad has only 2gb memory. So don't waste your time or money   to  get this battery. Good but not a "killer app" for this device: Â   Â  As much as I love using the internet on the  iPad , i do have a few issues with it, this is mostly because i've had to deal with bugs in the  Internet   application. I'm still working on some of these bugs, but the other issues are minor.  But you'll have to forgive me, it might be worth the time to get a few bugs fixed if you get this   battery,  It's not really a killer app for this product, it will not replace   Google Chrome or Firefox, it is a nice alternative if you're looking for a free alternative to these.  Other "killer apps" for the iPhone/iPad: Â  Â  It doesn't have a very good camera, but it's a good alternative to the iPhone Â . When it comes to a killer apps for this  iPhone, I can say that it's still not a good replacement for  Google or Mozilla. It's a great alternative to your  iPhone/ iPad when you need a simple alternative to Internet and Email, but if you want a more powerful, more powerful alternative, it would be better to get   a  good   alternative   like   Microsoft.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these to replace my Samsung Galaxy 5. The phones are very similar, except for the Galaxy 5 having a larger screen. The screen on my new Galaxy 5 has a bad print-to-body ratio and it's very difficult to find where to put the phone. The buttons are very mushy. I am also very annoyed that the screen and buttons don't even feel like they were made with the same materials as the Galaxy phones.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPad Mini, iPad mini 2, or an Android tablet will be the best thing for a person with a computer who is able to read on a screen at a distance of about 1 inch.  I have a tablet which I don't like very much; it's too easy to drop or damage it.   I like the quality of the iPad Mini and it has a decent number of apps but the screen is very small and the interface is clunky.  My computer can handle the screen of my iPad Mini but it is very hard to read text with a laptop computer because of the font size and the tiny text.  For a person who wants to use the tablet on a computer, it is better than nothing but the iPad mini 3 is far more capable and much nicer to look at.  This is the best tablet for the price I have seen.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received an    as a gift from my father and it was an excellent gift. However, it   did not work properly and I was disappointed that the device had to be repaired and it cost $140. I also thought that I was paying a lot for a used   and my father's used it. That said,   I  do recommend it to my brother and sister in law who also have  . However, as   is said in my review, Â it   should   be   tested   before   purchasing it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     (No, not for the people who bought a MacBook to use as a desktop)   When I got my unit, the unit's screen turned off, so I was left with a dark black screen with an Apple logo (kind of like an apple on a black background, except I guess it was supposed to be a dark blue-black) on a white background (in all its non-apple-logo-on-a-black-background glory).   That screen is completely unresponsive. It doesn't even work in my Mac. It is completely impossible to get anything done using it. It would have been nice if the screen worked as a keyboard - it isn't. I have to use the trackpad to do anything.   There is no way to turn the screen on/off when the system is asleep, so there is no light when you need it most.   for the money, I think they should have gone to a USB-C charger instead of the old USB one that is attached to the laptop and will be attached to my TV via a HDMI cord. (I had that charger in my drawer but sold it.)   In summary: I wouldn't buy it again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I bought this for a friend who is deaf. She has no idea how to operate the device so she could not get any sound out of it. I think that the sound is the worst in my experience, just a horrible noise.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only problem I had with this is that it doesn't have a micro SD card slot but this isn't a big deal if you like to play games on your Vita. For the price of the device and the fact that you can play your music and videos off the Vita for free and also play your Vita games on this device. If you don't want to listen to music on your handheld then don't buy this. I'd recommend buying another PlayStato for a cheaper price but since the Vita isn't getting any better this is a nice alternative.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I just bought a Xiaomi Mi4 and was a bit skeptical about how good it would be. I love my MacBook Pro and it's nice to have a second computer in the house so I can use it as a secondary screen while on the road. After the first use, however, I was rather disappointed with the Mi4. For one, it had a very annoying "beep" sound and it would occasionally not boot up. The other problems were with the screen and the battery life. The screen was awful, very dim. When I turned it on and off, I got this noise. The Mi4 didn't have a power switch so I couldn't power it on with one hand. You would have to get the charger in front of the screen. In addition, it only lasted 2.5-3 hours in my experience. This could be a software or a hardware problem. The battery lasted me only about 3.5 hours.   If you're not satisfied with the product, don't buy it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    How to install the VIA USB converter.   The instructions on this website work as written.  This USB to serial adapter is quite well built and very durable.  The only problem I had was with the USB converter, it came very cheaply and I have yet to get it to work.  I also don't like how the "connector" is on the back, I don't think I need to install a whole new case on my computer.  So I went to the store to buy a cheap USB cable and it's what I got.  It should work perfectly, just buy the same one that I used. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been buying electronic devices from KUDOSCOPE for years and am very satisfied with their products. The product I received did not fit in the slot on my iMac and the cable had to be cut off the socket to reach the battery. I did this to save money and it looks like they can use better packaging.    Noise  My eGo-C Twist had a really bad buzz that sounded like a bad electric toothbrush. I put a piece of wire from a different brand that does not sound like that. Then I put some lithium battery with my own charger into the eGo Twist and the buzz went away. I have had to use a rechargeable battery charger.  The Best  I have a KUDO-BOLT and it is by far the best portable battery ever. Not only is it light weight and convenient, but the charger it comes with can be used as a USB adapter for iPhones, iPods, etc. I always carry my KUDo-Bolt in my pocket, and it's so easy to charge at any fast food restaurant. I highly recommend this product
